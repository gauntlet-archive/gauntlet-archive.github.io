    <title>Looking for Additional Forum Moderation Volunteers</title>

    <description>We have a great team of moderators here on the forums. They’ve done an excellent job and we’re looking to add some additional helpers. In 2020 we’re trying to be better about rotating volunteers reduce burnout. Forum moderation&#39;s an important job that lets the site deal with problems and answer questions quickly.

If you’re interested in helping the Gauntlet out by doing some forum moderation, email us at [gauntletcommunity@gmail.com](mailto:gauntletcommunity@gmail.com).</description>
