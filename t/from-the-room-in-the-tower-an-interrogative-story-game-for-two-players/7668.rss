    <title>From The Room In The Tower - an interrogative story game for two players</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve just published _From The Room In The Tower_ on Itch - it&#39;s a simple two-player story game about the conversations between a captor and their captive. It plays out as a series of conversations over varying spans of time during which both Captor and Captive have a chance to further their goals using a simple resolution system based on the prisoners&#39; dilemma. 

It works well standalone or as game to play out with a captured character as part of a campaign.
