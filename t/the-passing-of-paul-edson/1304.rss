              <p>I was unable to make the trip to Paul’s memorial service, but I wanted to share a bit of an account that one of his good friends, Linda (who he sang opera with), sent to me:<br>
“The church was full - even the balcony. It made me so happy. All our opera peeps showed, 50+ members of the Washington National Opera Chorus. I went to the aerie after the reception was over to continue celebrating him there. None of his family spoke, but his brother wrote up some wonderful remarks, including the fact that even as a youngster Paul had trouble sleeping. Brother Tony said that the only thing that would calm him was listening to a favorite song - over and over and over!! The song? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jiitfTZj5Q" rel="nofollow noopener">Little Fat Policeman.</a> Not exactly sure how this is sleep-inducing, which gives us further insight…  Anyway, all these hard-partying Eagles went completely silent while Little Fat Policeman was played over the sound system. Followed by a toast with a shot of Fireball. Don’t ask.”</p>
<hr>
<p>This made me happy to hear and I wanted to share it with the community.</p>

              <p>Paul was the gentlest soul.  To say that I’ll miss seeing him at Camp Nerdly is such an understatement.  I did not know him well, but he made an impact on me.  I can only imagine how those closer to him are grieving right now.  Hugs.</p>
