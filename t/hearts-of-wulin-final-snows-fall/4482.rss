This is a double-length one-shot session of  [Hearts of Wulin](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/hearts-of-wulin.html) by Agatha Cheng and Lowell Francis. Hearts of Wulin is a game of wuxia melodrama, in which you play martial artists in a fantastical China who have complex and often conflicting relationships with one another. The game is inspired in particular by Chinese martial arts dramas, though in our shorter format films such as  *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*  and  *Hero*  will be key inspirations. The game completed a successful kickstarter campaign earlier this year, and I will be running using the most recently available set of rules. In order to speed up play, partially pre-generated characters will probably be used in this game. We will play using the [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) browser-based chat tool. This game will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants. Please be aware this session will run for a total of **7 hours**, including an hour&#39;s break in the middle. (So essentially two 3-hour sessions sandwiched together)

In the last days of winter, travellers are forced to take shelter at the mostly derelict Temple of Heavenly Clouds by a late snowfall. Confined to the halls of the temple, it quickly becomes clear that not all of those present are strangers to one another. Does something more than a quirk of weather bring them all together here? Will old rivalries and romances reignite? And just what is the truth behind the last days of the Temple of Heavenly Clouds?

Content Warning: There will be some violence, as appropriate to martial arts fiction, but no excessive gore. Please note that while our setting is a fantastical one, it is based on real cultures, and sensitivity to this is expected. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under [the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.
