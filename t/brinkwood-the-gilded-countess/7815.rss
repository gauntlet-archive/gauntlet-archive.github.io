    <title>Brinkwood: The Gilded Countess</title>

    <description>The world is not as it should be. The rich feed—literally—upon the poor, as blood-sucking vampires who barely bother to conceal their horrific, parasitic nature. The downtrodden people of the world struggle under the burdens of rent, payable through the sweat of their toil or the blood of their veins. Evil has triumphed. Many have given in to despair. But all is not lost.

In Brinkwood, you take on the role of brigands: renegades, thieves, and rebels struggling for freedom and liberation in a castylpunk world controlled by vampires. Radicalized by tragedy, you have taken up arms and fled into the forests, where you were taken in by unlikely allies—the fae, forgotten creatures of myth —who offered a different path and the means to fight back against your oppressors. In our campaign we will be fighting to free the land of Cardenfall from the control of the countess.

This is 9 sessions of Erik Bernhardt&#39;s Forged in the Dark game of rebellion against vampire despots scheduled for Monday nights in April and May at 8 PM US Eastern Time.

Content: This is a horror game about resistance to violent political oppression. It contains dark content, including violence, blood, death and political control. Though the characters will be fighting back against this darkness, they may be challenged by questions of how far they are willing to go to achieve their ends, and asked to pay a price in order to succeed. Revolution is bloody, and the game reflects that.

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. All-Access time is 8:00 PM US Eastern February 5, 2022. A seat is saved for Jason Zanes.

We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links and resources. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), as well as Script Change for safety tools.
