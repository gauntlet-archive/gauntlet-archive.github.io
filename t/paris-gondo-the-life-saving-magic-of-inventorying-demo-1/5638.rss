This event will open for general sign up on July 28th at 7pm.

**System:** Homemade
**Duration:** This session is expected to be 2 hours long
**Attendance:** Singe stand-alone session
**Requirements:** No reading, preparation or character creation is needed ahead of the session
**Platform:** Zoom for video conference + Miro Collaborative board for tabletop and gaming aids

The session will be recorded and posted for viewing per the consent of all involved.

&gt; *“A SIMPLE EFFECTIVE METHOD TO BANISH ENCUMBRANCE FOREVER!*

&gt; *PARIS GONDO is a spiritual custodian who left behind their physical form when they realised it did not “spark joy” in them.*

&gt; *This revered multidimensional organiser will help you DECLUTTER YOUR GEAR ONCE AND FOR ALL, through the 6 STEPS of their play-based GonParis Method.*

&gt; *It will not just free your equipment slots, IT WILL CHANGE YOU TOO. You will feel more blessed, roll more successes and get inspiration to complete the hero&#39;s journey you want.“*

-------------------------------------------------------------

This game is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to encumbrance rules and tropes commonly found in our beloved dungeon-crawling tabletop roleplaying games. 

It is a GM-less storytelling game for 3 to 6 players, designed to be played in a few hours with polyhedral dice and no preparation.

I will be facilitating the sessions. Players do not need to read anything ahead of the session.

We will use Discord as a voice room and to roll dice with a Miro collaborative board for our tabletop and gaming aids.

-------------------------------------------------------------

I am Kalum, from The Rolistes Podcast, and  ***&quot;Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying&quot;***  is my first ever attempt at developing and publishing a game.

Following a dozen encouraging sessions, I am know currently finalising a version short version of the rules which I hope to publish as Quickstart PDF before the end of 2020 ahead of Dragonmeet.

In parallel, I run online sessions to fine-tune scripted prompts to support the most  *invigorating and stimulating*  experience.

I also run those sessions also to raise awareness about this project.

You can follow its development via the [Paris Gondo Twitter account](https://twitter.com/parisgondo) and through subscribing to [The Rolistes Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/gJCUVX) (about everything I do) or the [Paris Gondo Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/g2ZAUP) (strictly about this game).

More information can be also found on [The Rolistes website](https://rolistespod.com/).

Feel free also to ask questions about the above or comment on you game experience in this [Gauntlet Forum post](https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-inventorying/5372/9).
