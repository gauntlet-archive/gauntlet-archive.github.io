    <title>Root: the RPG (2-shot / October 2019)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/root-the-rpg-2-shot-october-2019/3251</link>
    <description>**Root: The Tabletop Roleplaying Game** is based on the award-winning **Root: A Game of Woodland Might &amp; Right**, a board game about conflict and power, featuring struggles between cats, birds, mice, rabbits, foxes and more. You&#39;ll all play as vagabonds, denizens of the Woodland who have been cast out of &quot;civilised&quot; society, whether by their own volition or by exile. You venture throughout the woodland fulfilling jobs and tipping the scales in the conflict between the factions.

The game focuses on fun adventurous action and escapades, on the meaningful, lasting backdrop of the Woodland and its war. You&#39;ll get into big fights and stage cunning heists, and by doing so, you&#39;ll earn reputation with different Woodland factions, and perhaps even help them to take control over clearings. The game is currently being funded on Kickstarter, so this two-shot will be run using the Quickstart rules which are currently available for free on DriveThruRPG.

This is for two sessions of Root: the RPG over October. Sessions will be 3 hours each. Sessions will be recorded, but I&#39;ll ask permission before posting them on YouTube.

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

For this series we&#39;ll be using Lines and Veils, the X-card safety tool, and the Open Table Policy will also be in effect. For more information on the Gauntlet&#39;s safety tools, please refer to our Inclusivity Policy on the website (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
