              <p>I don’t have either of these games, but just noticed that Quietus was on sale on drivethru, when I recommended it on reddit for someone looking for a slasher flick kind of game.  Hopefully, some one has taken you up on the offer of some great looking games.</p>
<p>Cheers for looking out for others.</p>
