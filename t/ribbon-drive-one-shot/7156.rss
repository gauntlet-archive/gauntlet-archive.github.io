    <description>**A game about road trips, music, and self-discovery.**

In Ribbon Drive, we collectively create a story about a road trip. We each create a character, one of the people going on this road trip. We’ll share the responsibility of narrating the obstacles and scenery that comes up all around us. Music mixes guide our journey and shape the story as it unfolds. 
Our ultimate goal is to create a thought-provoking, meaningful experience. We let the music guide us. We let the road throw us curves. As our characters, we rethink our attachment to the future.

*****

Each of us needs to create a playlist or mix (we&#39;ll use Spotify to listen to these, so a playlist there would be the best thing). There are a few guidelines for creating mixes: they must be 30-70 minutes long, have a running theme, and have an interesting, descriptive title. Each of us will also need to provide the lyrics to the first two tracks on our playlists (https://www.azlyrics.com/ is great for this).

To listen to these playlists together, we&#39;ll either do it through a [Group Session](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/group-session/) on Spotify itself or through the [Listen Along](https://www.howtogeek.com/726346/how-to-host-a-spotify-group-listening-party-on-discord/) feature on Discord. 
Both options will require you to have a Spotify account (a free one will work).
