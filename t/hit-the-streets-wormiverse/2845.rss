    <description>This is is a four-session series. Attending all sessions is fun but not mandatory. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

**Hit the Streets: Defend the Block**  is a system built to tell stories of street-level super-powered people who are trying to deal with the struggle of everyday life and the responsibilities of having superpowers and a conscience. The characters we&#39;ll create won&#39;t be heroes, but they will still stand against the threats that plague their neighborhood. Or at least try to.

We will be playing in the setting of [Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_(web_serial)), a gritty super-hero web serial by John McCrae. Knowledge of the setting is a major plus, but you can still join if you are not familiar with it; I will ask you to read a brief doc detailing the peculiarities of super-powers in it though. We will play in the period soon after the Echdina crisis, where the existence of Cauldron capes is revealed to the public.

The way super-powers are handled in the wormiverse makes it so trauma is central to the life of most supers, so we will most likely touch on some heavy themes. This is  **not**  a light-hearted super-hero romp.

The X-card will be used, and we will be observing the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.

              <p>The trick was I didn’t attempt to adapt all of Worm, since HtS only deals with low-power capes. I’ll have to do some adjusting to the system to make some things work (and I can get you those notes as soon as I actually type them haha), but the base rule is that the characters’ capes will have powers that conform to the Hit the Streets rules, which manage to cover quite a large variety of tone-appropriate powersets.</p>

              <p>Very interesting! The Worm<br>
Series has some absolutely unique and fascinating world building for superheroes, in my opinion. It’s quite a piece of work!</p>
<p>Any chance you’re willing to share your document? I’d love to see how you’ve condensed that information.</p>
