    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/examples-of-self-published-rpgs-that-are-well-designed-laid-out-or-formatted/5849</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to throw together a short RPG (no itnent to print it, mostly will be used by me and my friends), but I don&#39;t know anything about design, layout, font-choices etc...

Anyone got any homemade examples that look nice that I could take a look at?</description>

              <p><em>Offworlders</em> has an exceptional layout. It’s a lot airier and modular than other more traditional game designs I especially like the way it composes its images. Meanwhile,<em>The Black Hack</em> takes the two column-layout and squeezes it for every drop of innovation it can.</p>
<p><em>Maze Rats</em> and <em>Knave</em> are gloriously simple but that’s partly because the games themselves are gloriously simple. What I especially like about them is how accessible their design is. They were laid out in Microsoft Word. The typeface does the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Someone already mentioned John Harper who I think is a graphic designer in his other life. So that means World of Dungeons, Lasers &amp; Feelings, Lady Blackbird, Agon, Blades in the Dark, Ghost/Echo, Ghost Lines, The Mustang.</p>
<p>Index Card RPG by Brandish Gilhelm (they go by Runehammer I believe).</p>
<p>Dave Cox who did A Rasp of Sand.</p>
<p>I don’t think Esoteric Enterprises is self published but Emmy Allen wrote and laid it out on her own.</p>

In terms of B&amp;W clean design a lot of OSR stuff is pretty god - Maze Rats, Rakehell - Issue One. I like the layout of The Stolen City, Rebel Crown, and Beak, Feather, &amp; Bone as well. In terms of more fancy designs Mothership and Dead Halt are pretty well designed as well (Mothership is especially great with visualizing important relationships).</p>

              <p>If you aren’t going to publish it, if it is just to be used by you and your friends, then you don’t need to worry about it having impressive layout and visual design. Seriously don’t make the task any hard than it has to be: make the best game you can, without worrying about how it looks. Visual appeal is a tool for convincing strangers to play your game, and that is not your problem.</p>
<p>If you are still worried about your game’s appearance, the best strategy is to ignore other games and just look to good examples of graphic design in general. For a short and easy start, try reading the <em>Non-Designer’s Design Book</em> by Robin Williams (not that Robin Williams).</p>

              <p>I’m looking to throw together a short RPG (no itnent to print it, mostly will be used by me and my friends), but I don’t know anything about design, layout, font-choices etc…</p>
<p>Anyone got any homemade examples that look nice that I could take a look at?</p>
