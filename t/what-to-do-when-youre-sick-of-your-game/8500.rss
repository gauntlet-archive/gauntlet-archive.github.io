    <title>What to do when you&#39;re sick of your game</title>

    <description>The DesignDoc duo are speaking in my headset a very good podcast right now. I can compare it to only one other podcast : kF and Eugenie&#39;s podcast on failure states of a game session.
It&#39;s strange, it implies less treaded trails, but to me, it is next level in how I can relate to what they say. Most of the promotional strategies are out the window, I can take what they say in earnest. It&#39;s liberating. 
And when you open that door, some fruitful gold nuggets start to fall when you speak. Way to go Hannah and Evan!
