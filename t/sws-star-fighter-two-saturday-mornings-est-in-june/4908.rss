&quot;All wings report in.&quot;

&quot;Red leader standing by.&quot;

&quot;Green leader standing by.&quot;

&quot;Lock s-foils in attack position.&quot;

&quot;May the Force be with us.&quot;

Play an X-Wing squadron hunting Imperials down across the galaxy and help the New Republic restore peace.

We&#39;re using the RPG Star Fighter to play through some exciting missions and stories. Star Fighter is a very fast-paced, cinematic RPG, that is very intuitive, and simple to play. It favors excitement and good story-telling over tactics and stiff rules. It uses a unique dice pool mechanic, composed of d6s and d8s, that focuses solely on the players&#39; side of events; GMs never need to roll. The end result is a sci-fi game built around players trying to stay one step ahead of the trouble that they create. 

A seat has been reserved for Tommy Fields.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is after the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded and shared assuming all parties agree.

There will be 2 sessions in total. Being able to attend both sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools Lines and Veils and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use, as well as post-game feedback after each session.
