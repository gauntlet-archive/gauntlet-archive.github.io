    <title>Community Radio (one-shot)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/community-radio-one-shot/6336</link>
    <description>Community Radio is a dark comedy improv game that tells the stories of an isolated and weird community. It stitches together improv “slice of life” stories together in the dispatches and announcements of the local public radio host, who may or may not completely beholden to a sinister and mysterious City Council. 

Play occurs by alternating between Slice of Life scenes and Radio scenes. A Slice of Life scene lets community members improv a scene showing life in the town then later making decrees as members of the Council. Afterwards, we will get a summary, announced decrees of the Council and entertainment from the host.
