**THIS IS AN ALPHA PLAYTEST**

*One seat is reserved for Sam Z, the designer of this game.*

*The clash of swords, the report of gunshots, and the chanting of a thousand voices echo through the streets of Paris. Revolution has come, and chaos is an opportunity. In* ***L’Oracle de la Révolution*** *, you will play as the wealthy, the influential, and the powerful citizens of Paris during the French Revolution. Use your talents and your connections to fight your way to the top, and write your name on the annals of history.*

Révolution is a GMless story game for 4 players. The game is based on the Belonging Outside Belonging system. The session will take roughly 4 hours and no prior knowledge of the game, system, or the French Revolution is necessary.

Tone touchstones: Game of Thrones, Faust, Assassin’s Creed: Unity, House of Cards

Setting touchstones: Les Misérables, A Tale of Two Cities, Assassin’s Creed: Unity

Safety Tools: We will be using Script Change and Lines and Veils. There are additional safety tools built into the game that will be described during the session.
