    <description>***One spot in this game is saved for Donogh.***

Lord Walnut is dead, and all of you gathered here are suspects. Soon a private detective will arrive, and buried secrets will begin to emerge. Simmering grudges and unspoken desires will come to light. But will the guilty party be caught, or can they cast enough suspicion on the innocent to get away with their terrible crime?

Lady Susan PI is a Good Society hack of “murder drama”, but not really a mystery game. Whether and how the killer is caught will be less of a focus than the drama caused by the murder and the tight web of relationships between the suspects. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. 

We’ll agree on a tone as part of our set up for the game, with options ranging from drama to farce but probably leaning at least somewhat comical. Subject matter in this game includes murder, romantic entanglements, and likely other scandalous secrets. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

I’ve scheduled this to run two days in a row at what I hope is a reasonably Euro-friendly time. According to the game text, a single session takes about 4.5 hours, so our sessions may run a little short or we can just give ourselves more time to let the scenes play out. If it doesn’t look like filling on consecutive days, I’ll reschedule for a single session. 

Signing up for both sessions is strongly encouraged. 

Sessions will run over Zoom with short breaks on the hour. I’ll email players a week or so before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials. 

Open access time for sign ups is 8:30am 11 October AEDT.
