    <title>Gauntlet Reading Club: The Chosen and the Beautiful/Urban Shadows - November/December Saturdays 11 AM GMT-7</title>

    <description>The Gauntlet Reading Club is an idea originated by our David Morrison in which participants agree to read a book together and use the experience to inspire our collaborative worldbuilding in a run of a paired roleplaying game. For the months of November and December, we&#39;ll be reading [The Chosen and the Beautiful by Nghi Vo](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250784780) paired with Urban Shadows 2e from [Magpie Games](https://magpiegames.com/).

*Immigrant. Socialite. Magician.*

*Jordan Baker grows up in the most rarefied circles of 1920s American society—she has money, education, a killer golf handicap, and invitations to some of the most exclusive parties of the Jazz Age. She’s also queer, Asian, adopted, and treated as an exotic attraction by her peers, while the most important doors remain closed to her.*

*But the world is full of wonders: infernal pacts and dazzling illusions, lost ghosts and elemental mysteries. In all paper is fire, and Jordan can burn the cut paper heart out of a man. She just has to learn how.*

We&#39;ll will be drawing on the thematic inspiration of  *The Chosen and the Beautiful*  rather than specific plot points, and will have a discussion on tone and content before play, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience.

We&#39;ll be using Streamyard to discuss and play, but the sessions will only be recorded and posted publicly with everyone&#39;s enthusiastic consent to each.

Please note that participation in the initial “book club” session - or at least having read some of the book in advance - will be a requirement for playing in the game.

This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.

**Content Warnings for The Chosen and Beautiful:**  Racism, Heavy Drinking, Sexual content

**Note for UK residents:**  The Chosen and the Beautiful has limited availability in the UK. If you&#39;re a resident of UK, or have problems finding the book for any other reason, message me on the Slack or in the forum and I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re able to get a copy
