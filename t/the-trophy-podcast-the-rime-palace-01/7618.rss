    <description>The official Trophy Gold actual play series continues in The Trophy Podcast feed! The Rime Palace is a continuation of the story started in Hester&#39;s Mill (also available in the feed). This is co-production with ChimaeraCast, who were also the players in the game. The incursion was written by @Alexi_Sarge and Trophy Gold was created by @jesseross

It&#39;s an *excellent*  AP, very entertaining. Enjoy!
