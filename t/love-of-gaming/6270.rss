    <description>My little brother wants me to run a game for him and his friends, ages 12-13. Do you guys have any tips or ideas that could help them get into the game as first time role players?</description>

<p>Beyond that, let me echo <a class="mention" href="/u/dereel">@DeReel</a> - come forward with something that excites and motivates you, and let that spread to them.</p>
<p>I like to pitch 2-4 games I’m really excited about, and let them choose between them.</p>

              <p>Hello, You know them better than we do ! But most important in my view is… start from you. You DM with what you are, with your experience, etc. Double guessing the players ? the goal is that they surprise you. But you : where do you have balance, where are your roots ? From there you can push. What is it you have to express, I mean.</p>
<p>Well, that would be my take. If you can make a little survey before play, about expectations regarding party, story, characters, <a href="https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-same-page-tool/">etc.</a> that’s writing some misunderstandings out from the start.</p>
