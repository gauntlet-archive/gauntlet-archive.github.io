          <p>Hello,<br>
Rewards can be used for teaching &amp; learning various things.<br>
I was schooled by Master <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/rickard">@Rickard</a> Elimaa on the topic, so I prefer to get the same result like this: if you materialize a rule, like through a token, people will remember it (this is also sort of linked to affordance). I‚Äôve read Vincent Baker saying something like: and if the token is beneficial to someone, they‚Äôll signal it. That‚Äôs not necessary, but the contraposition is true (I‚Äôm looking at you, encumbrance rules).</p>
<p>Roughly:<br>
In Prime Time Adventures (2004), that was for cheering for others‚Äô propositions.<br>
In The Shadow of Yesterday, that was for playing your character and eventually lead them through a personal arc.<br>
In Dream Askew (2014) that was for playing your character in a way that supports the others‚Äô roleplay.<br>
I see progress!</p>
<p>My question is: what could be the <strong>next</strong> things on the list? the things you think would make for ‚Äúbetter‚Äù play but are often unseen or forgotten?</p>

<p>I think regular social friend-group managing. Keeping things safe and fun and remembering that the friends trump the game.</p>
<p>People &gt; Play</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs an entirely different discussion.</p>

          <p>I can just say what I always say:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect" rel="nofollow noopener">the overjustification effect</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_evaluation_theory" rel="nofollow noopener">Cognitive Evaluation Theory</a>, a tangible reward like XP (extrinsic - something given on top of the actual task) does nothing to or <em>may</em> decrease the (intrinsic) fun of doing the actual task. Some are more sensitive to the reward than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two main exceptions are if the tangible reward is given while 1) it‚Äôs a competition (for example, in a RPG combat) or 2) if it‚Äôs a social reward. Then the reward can even <em>increase</em> the fun of doing the actual task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A die roll is a reward mechanism in itself -  a <a href="https://blog.ihobo.com/2007/05/designing-rewar.html" rel="nofollow noopener">really strong one as well</a>. It‚Äôs like a slot machine, where the roll sometimes gives you a reward (success).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XP for tasks creates a clear goal, which is nice. A ‚Äúclear goal‚Äù is a requirement of getting into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)#Characteristics" rel="nofollow noopener">flow</a>, which is a one way of describing (intrinsic) fun.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we designed without dice (random elements) and XP? We would start to need to think in terms of making the actual tasks fun by themselves. I‚Äôm not saying that we always should, but what if‚Ä¶?</p>

<p>Yeah, but how do they work in order to create ‚Äúfun‚Äù? (if we ignore that ‚Äúfun‚Äù is merely a buzzword, and instead assume that ‚Äúgame X is fun for you‚Äù)</p>
<p>Fun is an emotional response to learning, which is said in <a href="https://www.theoryoffun.com/resources.shtml" rel="nofollow noopener">Theory of Fun: 10 Years Later</a> when it quotes Chris Crawford. We are learning machines, and we get dopamine release in our brain to reward us when we learn. So ‚Äúfun‚Äù ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs chemical, not emotional.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to draw advantage of us as learning machines, we need to create a process in our game that creates a learning experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The easiest way is by using a <a href="https://lostgarden.home.blog/2012/04/30/loops-and-arcs/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">game loop</a>, which is basically how you get into a flow state.</p>

<p>We can also look at what 1) XP and 2) die rolls do: the first one creates a <strong>clear goal</strong>. The second one inflicts <strong>uncertainty</strong>. In Western narratives, we always use ‚Äúconflict‚Äù as a mean of creating uncertainty. Tabletop roleplaying games also uses escapism, like fantasy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to get to a goal, something stand in it‚Äôs way, so a challenge is created. Bernard Suits defines a game as ‚Äúvoluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles‚Äù, which is both hilarious and has some truth to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We need challenge and uncertainty. When it comes to decision-making, both Keith Burgun and Greg ‚ÄúStar Wars d6‚Äù Costikyan says that a meaningful decision occur when the solution is not obvious and when it‚Äôs not at random, but in the middle of the scale. I even wonder if that doesn‚Äôt go with everything we do.</p>
<p>However, in order to replace ‚ÄúXP as goal describer‚Äù, we need to separate the thought that the game designer‚Äôs goal should be the players‚Äô goals: ‚ÄúHit an orc and get XP‚Äù - the game designer shouldn‚Äôt want the players to have to same goal, to hit the orc, but to have a goal of their own and then the orc must be a way of getting to that goal (a challenge!). So the game designer‚Äôs goal should be part of the players‚Äô actions to get to their goal.</p>

          <p>‚Äúchemical, not emotional‚Äù I‚Äôd say both. The neuroscientific framework is one perspective. Not that I deny the role of brain chemicals you present. But as neurosciences are being instrumentalized by some politicians in my country, I felt the need to make that clear.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMost Valuable Player‚Äù introduces competition: you can‚Äôt take this individually, you‚Äôve got to see the whole system of the group. I find individual prizes can degrade social reward mechanism fast if they‚Äôre not actively compensated for (rewarding the most ridiculous story, basing rewards on silly arbitrary factors and most of all, spreading rewards evenly to deprive them of meaning) Cheering wears off fast, too. There are social rewards more subtle than that.</p>
<p>For me what works best is this (thanks for the SG link): meaningfully aknowledging contributions, throughout the game. Reincorporation alone is very empowering, and ‚Äúnarratively‚Äù satisfying. Playing the impact, staying with the moment: these are some techniques that show you appreciating other players contribution, and being int the collective, in the moment. Priming the pump with some cheering, a meaningful smile, or a thumb up (not in some african countries) is very efficient.</p>
<p>Of course, that goes with a style of play. You can‚Äôt just ‚Äúslap cheering on top‚Äù and call that a sure-fun game. Like every other game design, a mechanism works in a system. I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre just used to seeing rewards as ‚Äúmoney‚Äù and economy as ‚Äúhow money flows‚Äù, so the lexicon is tainted. It‚Äôs easier to say a game is ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù. However blurry a ‚Äúcloud eating‚Äù concept that is.</p>

          <p>In the absence of mechanical incentive, how do you guide players into doing what the game does? How is a sentence like ‚Äúthis is a cowboy game, act like cowboys‚Äù ideologically different than ‚Äúthis is a cowboy game, you get XP for rootin‚Äô, tootin‚Äô, and shootin‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>And if the response is ‚Äúwhy should players be limited to acting like cowboys in a cowboy game?‚Äù Why did they pick up the <em>cowboy</em> game?</p>
<p>The core of the argument suggests to me that ttrpgs are special magic in which you can do anything, which describes the activity of ‚Äúroleplaying‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs transitive to any specific game and components any more than saying novels shouldn‚Äôt be beholden to pages, sentences, grammar, or plots because you could write any word you want in there.</p>

<p>You can roleplay while playing any game in the same way that you can eat pretzels while playing any game. If we‚Äôre corralling our scope to ttrpgs, I feel like it‚Äôs an abdication of your job as a designer to not create systems that interact with roleplaying.

<p>Exactly. To some people or groups ‚Äúplaying the game‚Äù includes coming together with friends, chatting, eating snacks, drinking beer, etc. and that is the reason they all come together. Each table has its own kind of culture or way that games are played. For some game-night is very technical and rule focused, for others it‚Äôs a very social thing, with a bunch of little small traditions baked in.</p>
<p>In that way, game night can be a reward unto itself. It means hanging out with friends, which, as a person over 30 years old, I must say, is a hard thing to achieve, with all the carriers and babies and duties etc.</p>
<p>I agree that goals in a game aren‚Äôt a bad thing at all, but achieving the goal isn‚Äôt necessarily the reward, the journey towards it, together is. At least in some groups.</p>
<p>The idea of just letting the fun emerge and seeing that as the reward to play is put here as a challenge. I don‚Äôt think games need to abandon any reward structure, because there‚Äôs a type of fun to be had in achieving the thing you set out to do. But this challenge, I think, makes you consider, or think, if it could be possible having fun together consistently without a baked in reward system.</p>
<p>I think with story games specifically, whatever you do, story will likely emerge on its own, regardless of wether or not it‚Äôs mechanically rewarded, because it‚Äôs rewarded by the fun you have doing it.</p>

<p>In the absence of mechanical incentive, how do you guide players into doing what the game does? How is a sentence like ‚Äúthis is a cowboy game, act like cowboys‚Äù ideologically different than ‚Äúthis is a cowboy game, you get XP for rootin‚Äô, tootin‚Äô, and shootin‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¶ and this is (one reason) why I always say that the pitch (a selling one!) is the most important part of the game, because it sets up how the reader interpret the rest of the text.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo for guts and glory, and backstab your friends along the way‚Äù directly states what the game is about.</p>
<p>I also don‚Äôt think that a game should try to appeal to a lot of playstyles. Just focus on one - preferably the one you think is fun yourself, and sell that playstyle to the reader (or repeat the thought) all through the book.</p>

          <p>I don‚Äôt really agree with the prevailing opinion here ‚Äì I‚Äôve played lots of games with a strong pitch and no mechanical followthrough and found them extremely disappointing.  By the same token, there are reasons you would pick a game over another, and just putting a cowboy on the cover is insufficient to help me feel like I am playing a cowboy, or even that I am trying to play a cowboy, and certainly not that I should use YOUR game to try to play a cowboy. A game book can talk about what it‚Äôs ‚Äúabout‚Äù until the designer wears the letters off their keyboard and it‚Äôs not going to help me one bit if the game itself doesn‚Äôt drive the experience.</p>
<p>Maybe I am some poor, sad, emotionally stunted person who needs his game to reward him because he has lost his inner child and ability to ‚Äújust have fun while pretending to be someone else‚Äù but I doubt it‚Ä¶ because if I wanted to do that, I wouldn‚Äôt need a GAME.</p>
<p>There seems a bizarre abdication here of trying to actually design games to encourage things. Some people think Big Eyes, Small Mouth is an acceptable ‚Äúanime game‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs basically a generic system with some ‚Äúanime themed‚Äù things you can buy with your points and a bunch of anime-styled art.  And I think it‚Äôs awful and that the stories you get when you play it don‚Äôt even resemble anime unless you‚Äôve got such a mastery of the genre you‚Äôre going for that you don‚Äôt need a game at all.</p>
<p>So give me my XP rewards. Those at least make it abundantly clear what the game thinks is important to this genre, and odds are that if I follow that breadcrumb trail, I‚Äôm going to get something that feels more like the genre I‚Äôm going for than I would if I didn‚Äôt.  Give me those intrinsic rewards ‚Äì they are intrinsic, because they are part of the game.  An extrinsic reward would be my GM saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy you dinner if you roleplay a cowboy.‚Äù but XP says ‚ÄúRoleplay a cowboy, and we‚Äôll let your cowboy do more awesome stuff.‚Äù  The idea that this entire school of extremely successful design is in fact a bunch of extrinsic rewards that have been decreasing everyone‚Äôs enjoyment since The Shadow of Yesterday came up with Keys or Primetime Adventures came up with fanmail seems out of touch with the fact that these games work extremely well for a lot of people ‚Äì not just me, but most of the folks I play with.</p>
<p>Maybe the point that everyone is missing that I am dancing around here is that a game with good XP triggers and actions and things teaches you how to roleplay a cowboy.  Maybe everyone else is already so good at playing cowboys that they don‚Äôt need that, but I routinely play games in genres that I havent‚Äô been immersed in my whole life. And I‚Äôd be shocked to discover that everyone has such mastery of every genre they want to play a game in that they can‚Äôt learn anything from a well designed XP trigger.  Honestly, if your audience is ‚Äúpeople who know the genre you are trying to reproduce so well that they don‚Äôt need a game to help them‚Äù then I think your game isn‚Äôt going to be much fun for anyone, because the people you are aiming it at don‚Äôt need it or want it, and the people who do need it can‚Äôt use it.  There‚Äôs no freaking way I‚Äôd be able to ‚Äújust be a faerie!‚Äù without using something like Under Hollow Hills.</p>

          <p>This is a pretty good topic, and smarter folk than I have already said very clever stuff on this thread, so I won‚Äôt be long in giving my two cents.</p>
<p>Rules-incentive does not exist to underscore optimal play, but to undermine it.</p>
<p>Take Apocalypse World, for instance. A character will have some high points in some stats and low points in others. So the optimal line of play is to engage with the world in such a way that you only trigger moves for your best stats. Except that you gain XP for using your marked stats, and what do you know, the MC marked your worse stat! So now suddenly a suboptimal play becomes not so suboptimal, because if you don‚Äôt do it you get less XP and advance less often.</p>
<p>This happens again and again. In Urban Shadows, I could feasibly always go to a contact with my highest scoring faction every time I need to Hit the Streets, but since I need to roll with all factions to advance, doing so is suddenly not the optimal line of play. Dungeon World sets itself apart from OSR by giving XP for failed rolls: players want to engage with the moves even if they don‚Äôt use their best stats, because that‚Äôs how they advance.</p>
<p>This effectively means that players can‚Äôt optimize the story out of a PbtA game, generally; playing optimally in this way is effectively non-optimal in the long run. Does it make it so players are only running the threadmill? Perhaps, but it‚Äôs better than players who do act in accordance to the story being worse off at the game than agnostic min-maxers.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think the important thing to remember is that, at worst, it only changes the treadmill ‚Äì from ‚Äúdoing the mechanically optimal thing that keeps my character alive/gets me the most loot/whatever‚Äù to ‚Äúdoing the mechanically optimal thing that hits my XP triggers and coincidentally causes me to roleplay something other than a kill-and-loot-bot‚Äù.  If players are looking for a treadmill in a game, they WILL find out.  And if they‚Äôre just gonna ‚Äúdo what they want regardless‚Äù? Well, then I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter what the incentives are, because they‚Äôll just do what they wany, right? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

          <p>Well, sure. But in the early sessions, when a character isn‚Äôt well developed in the player‚Äôs mind, this can work as an aid. If I don‚Äôt have any notion of what Borga does as a characer, I‚Äôll have her act in the way that‚Äôs most advantageous in-game. If that mode is to just punch stuff and steal gold, she‚Äôll develop as a murderhobo. If that mode has her become entangled in the lives of other characters, then she develops in a way that engages thematically with the game.</p>
<p>Of course a player can always just run the treadmill or be a rebel and do whatever, but a treadmill can help steer them towards the ‚Äúright‚Äù path (i.e. the one in which the game‚Äôs mechanics and theme work the best)</p>

          <p>I feel like you feel attacked by our questioning wether rules-incentives to play actually work or hinder. This was not my intent.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs not my intent to seem like a high and mighty super-enlightened role-player who doesn‚Äôt need the rules anymore. (there is no spoon!)<br>
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs also not my intent to invalidate all the work you have done on games you made which emulate a genre or give incentive for a certain type of desired play.</p>
<p>To me, this is just a question to make us think about rules, and what they are there for, where we get our fun playing games, etc.</p>
<p>To me it looks like you are in a mindset of creating a finished game to publish. This is not at all where my mind is at right here. It‚Äôs at the experimental hobby table, to see what is fun. To see how things work and what fun experiments we could do. And maybe, perhaps, something gets made here that could be published, but that is not my end-goal at all. It‚Äôs not even my incentive or motivation. I am not really with what seems to be the current mindset, where everything you make has to be a publishable, professional thing. I just want to see and think and experiment to see what is possible.</p>
<p>I miss the time where games like ‚ÄúAll outta bubblegum‚Äù and ‚ÄúActual Cannibal Shia LeBoeff‚Äù and ‚ÄúRoll 4 Shoes‚Äù just popped into existence on a forum. Where people just saw something, where like: ‚ÄúHuh? What if I tried to make a game out of this?‚Äù and then did it. It was all barely finished and unpolished and to me that made it great. Cause people would make threads like ‚ÄúHey, I wrote this silly thing to see if this works. What do you guys think?‚Äù and the threads would be full of discussion and creativity.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this to say. I‚Äôm not thinking about making a finished product. I‚Äôm not thinking about making money off of this or starting a kickstarter or selling a pamphlet. I‚Äôm thinking: ‚ÄúWhat could this inspire us to do?‚Äù</p>
