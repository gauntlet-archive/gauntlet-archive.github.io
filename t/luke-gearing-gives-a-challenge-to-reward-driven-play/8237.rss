    <description>In a [blogpost](https://lukegearing.blot.im/against-incentive), Luke Gearing challenges the idea that we need rules-incentives or rewards for certain types of play. Since this is a staple of many PbtA type games, I thought I&#39;d share it here and see if there&#39;s some discussion to be had.

I have been thinking the same type of thing. If you like doing it, isn&#39;t it a reward in itself?</description>

              <p>So apparently, when I was lying in bed last night, I thought of this.</p>
<p>Another advantage to “incentives” is that they give “permission” to people to do things they might not otherwise do.  I think this is sortof similar to how rules and dice allow the GM to say “It wasn’t me who made that bad thing happen, it was the dice!” having incentives allows players to say “I did it for the XP!” and for people to understand that, yes, that’s kinda the point of the game.  The game is clearly telling you to do that thing.  So you don’t need to apologize for doing it.</p>
<p>This does mean that you need to be really kinda careful with what kind of behaviors your system incentivizes (See: Murder Hobo) but it’s possibly the most powerful thing about incentives.</p>

<p>The more randomness you have, the less control you got. Do note that the scale says “participation” and “uncertainty”. There is a jump between <em>participation</em> and challenge, just as it’s a jump between curiosity and <em>uncertainty</em> - something must happen in between those. You don’t get curious just because something is uncertain.</p>
<p>I think this is the last thing I will say about this, because this discussion is kinda stale, because I’m just repeating myself. I’m talking from a high level of abstraction, where you need some sort of obstruction, otherwise things will become boring, just as well as you need uncertainty for the very same thing. At least in games. Simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow" rel="nofollow noopener">flow</a> thinking.</p>
<p>But sure, I can clean in order to make my spouse happy (or make myself feel good). No real uncertainty, apart from my expectation of her reaction. The same could be said about preparing an adventure. And there could be parts where you have all uncertainty, like randomizing a map through a hex grid.</p>
<p>So I agree with you there. Specific elements within a game can have purely one, but the sweet spot is usually around the middle (tension). A meaningful decision have about the same amount of uncertainty and enough information to come to a conclusion. A chess game have (apart from the opponent) emergent complexity, where so many things can happen that it’s hard to predict the outcome.</p>

              <p>It seems a little odd to me to set it up on a scale, not because I’m opposed to scales, but because I don’t really think there’s any relationship between “challenge” and “uncertainty” and increasing one doesn’t necessarily decrease the other.</p>
<p>But really,  I think the thing that needs to be recognized here is that TTRPGs almost universally have uncertainty.  Even if you strip dice and randomizers out, anytime you are playing with other people, there is uncertainty.  Maybe in some solo games there’s “no” uncertainty, but I don’t really think even that is the case, unless you have plotted the entire “story” in your head ahead of time.</p>
<p>So, even if I accept that your scale is true, since every game has uncertainty, you do not, necessarily, “need” (ugh, “need” is such a weird thing to even be discussing here, IMHO) to add any challenge.  You CAN have challenge, if you want to, and that creates a different type of game, but to say you “need” it, well, I can’t really agree.</p>

<p>It’s more to acknowledge that challenge is a thing to consider.</p>
<p>I usually hate scales with two oppositions, because I think they obstruct the ability to see more possibilities, but I think of games/activities as on a scale, where there is challenge on one side and uncertainty on another. So yeah, I agree that no challenge could be a thing (or a challenge that is so easy it’s not really a challenge at all, just a minor nuisance).</p>
<p>Solving crosswords can be (almost) without uncertainty, and playing craps is (almost) without a challenge.</p>

<p>I do think it’s important to acknowledge both - to really think about how they are present - when creating a game. Chess, as well as roleplaying games, have the other participant(s) as an uncertainty, to give an example.</p>

<p>Yup! Or they can just relax and do what comes to mind, or whatever in between.   And not all “goals” are “challenges” so they might have a goal that’s not difficult, just different, and so on.</p>

<p>If doing anything is a challenge, then nothing is a challenge.  I’m not really left with any sense of what you are actually saying is needed/desirable here.  Some of my best game experiences were completely unchallenging.  Heck, there’s an entire category of fun (“submission”) which I think is more or less exclusive of challenge.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a different term you could use? “Participation” tells me more, honestly, than this “everything is a challenge” definition, but then you say you don’t think it’s right, so I’m just lost.</p>

              <p>Depends on where you draw the line. I mean, even the most railroaded experience can test the players, even if they don’t have anything to say, but they still need to imagine it in their head in certain ways. Reading a book is a challenge, or at least being invested in a book. I can hardly think that investment can grow without challenge. There have to be some sort of participation, and challenge will follow that. Perhaps “participation” is a better word for it, but that implies that the participant is doing something active - you can be invested even if you’re taking a passive part (see the second sentence for an example).</p>
<p>Even reading this post is a challenge, in my opinion.</p>

I’m more interesting in thinking “in what ways is this useful?” “how can we use this tool?” “can this tool be self-defeating?” I won’t repeat myself, but I think that in-game XP for actions that underscore a game’s themes help it emerge naturally from gameplay.</p>

<p>There is a lot of things going on “under the hood”, and I wrote more about that in <a href="https://rickard80.github.io/storygames/?19869" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> [Imagine] Using my own theory to create it</a>. The thread is painted by my “theory of engagement”, so only a minor part of the text is talking about the topic in this thread.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong> also written as a process, and humans have a hard time understanding it. It’s like trying to predict the outcome of Chess before actually playing it. So the game needs to be played to be understood. That’s how I understood my game, at least. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>My apologies for that then. I mainly post these things to form an opinion, not because mine is already set in stone. I do like the thought-experiment mindset that goes “but what if no rewards?” to make it extreme to see what that would do. As such I often play devils advocate and challenge opinions posted. I learn from the answers given. Many have good points.</p>

<p>I don’t think a system ever “needs” to do anything – name anything that systems “need” to do and I will find you a successful system that doesn’t do it. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> As a corrolary, I don’t think discussing what a system “needs” to do is useful.  There are many things a system <em>can</em> do, but none of them are requirements.  The interesting part of game design for me is looking at the things you could include and then deciding, based on how they impact the game, which ones you should include?</p>
<p>So really, shouldn’t we be discussing the effects of doing or not doing certain things?</p>
<p>Also, I think it’s never a good idea to assume that any behavior is going to be “automatic”; I’d even go so far as to say that nothing is really ‘automatic’. Everything about games is learned in some way.  As a result, if something is ‘automatic’ for a given group, the odds are really good that it’s actually a habit that they have either formed unwittingly or deliberately cultivated.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a game that created <em>investment in fiction</em> (immersion, but in story). Had no idea if the game was fun, or (more importantly) <em>how</em> it would be fun … but it was, and created investment in a character in under an hour. You could also play this game by yourself, but I think something will be lost due to the lack of uncertainties that the other participants brings (by how the game wants the group to talk to each other).</p>
<p>I guess <strong>The Murder of Mr. Crow</strong>, also featured in the link, is a game without tangible rewards. Just a game loop, with instructions, that is continuously repeated.</p>

• It’s also not my intent to invalidate all the work you have done on games you made which emulate a genre or give incentive for a certain type of desired play.</p>
<p>To me, this is just a question to make us think about rules, and what they are there for, where we get our fun playing games, etc.</p>
<p>To me it looks like you are in a mindset of creating a finished game to publish. This is not at all where my mind is at right here. It’s at the experimental hobby table, to see what is fun. To see how things work and what fun experiments we could do. And maybe, perhaps, something gets made here that could be published, but that is not my end-goal at all. It’s not even my incentive or motivation. I am not really with what seems to be the current mindset, where everything you make has to be a publishable, professional thing. I just want to see and think and experiment to see what is possible.</p>

If I don’t have any notion of what Borga does as a characer, I’ll have her act in the way that’s most advantageous in-game. If that mode is to just punch stuff and steal gold, she’ll develop as a murderhobo. If that mode has her become entangled in the lives of other characters, then she develops in a way that engages thematically with the game.</p>
<p>Of course a player can always just run the treadmill or be a rebel and do whatever, but a treadmill can help steer them towards the “right” path (i.e. the one in which the game’s mechanics and theme work the best)</p>

<p>I think the important thing to remember is that, at worst, it only changes the treadmill – from “doing the mechanically optimal thing that keeps my character alive/gets me the most loot/whatever” to “doing the mechanically optimal thing that hits my XP triggers and coincidentally causes me to roleplay something other than a kill-and-loot-bot”.  If players are looking for a treadmill in a game, they WILL find out.  And if they’re just gonna “do what they want regardless”? Well, then I guess it doesn’t matter what the incentives are, because they’ll just do what they wany, right? <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>This is a pretty good topic, and smarter folk than I have already said very clever stuff on this thread, so I won’t be long in giving my two cents.</p>
<p>Rules-incentive does not exist to underscore optimal play, but to undermine it.</p>
<p>Take Apocalypse World, for instance. A character will have some high points in some stats and low points in others. So the optimal line of play is to engage with the world in such a way that you only trigger moves for your best stats. Except that you gain XP for using your marked stats, and what do you know, the MC marked your worse stat! So now suddenly a suboptimal play becomes not so suboptimal, because if you don’t do it you get less XP and advance less often.</p>
<p>This happens again and again. In Urban Shadows, I could feasibly always go to a contact with my highest scoring faction every time I need to Hit the Streets, but since I need to roll with all factions to advance, doing so is suddenly not the optimal line of play. Dungeon World sets itself apart from OSR by giving XP for failed rolls: players want to engage with the moves even if they don’t use their best stats, because that’s how they advance.</p>
<p>This effectively means that players can’t optimize the story out of a PbtA game, generally; playing optimally in this way is effectively non-optimal in the long run. Does it make it so players are only running the threadmill? Perhaps, but it’s better than players who do act in accordance to the story being worse off at the game than agnostic min-maxers.</p>
