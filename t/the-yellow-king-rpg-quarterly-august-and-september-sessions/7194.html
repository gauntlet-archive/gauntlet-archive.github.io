          <p><em><strong>These sessions follow and continue my July game. For the first 48 hours, please only sign up if you are currently playing in those games.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note that I expect occasional player absences, so waitlisted players are likely to be invited for guest spots during this run.</strong></em></p>
<p>In Belle Epoque Paris, a group of art students began to uncover the terrible truth about the King In Yellow and watched reality unravel around them. They could not stop or even fully understand what was happening. Now, in three different eras, those who follow must pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>The game uses a version of the Gumshoe rules, but players don’t need to know the system and rules will be taught in play. I think it’s a pretty streamlined version, including less of a focus on investigation than other Gumshoe games.</p>
<p>The tone and pace of the game will vary significantly across the series: pulpy action for the Wars, a more modern thriller style in Aftermath, and who even knows what for This Is Normal Now. Overall, I expect more of an eerie slow-burn style where many of the game’s mysteries remain uncanny and inexplicable.</p>
<p>Subject matter: This is a horror game and includes violence, gore, the dissolution of reality, and some body horror. We’ll discuss any specific subject matter concerns before we start play in each of the game’s settings. I also note that unlike some cosmic horror games, there is no sanity mechanic and the game does not mechanise mental illness (instead using a card-based system for ‘shocks’ that I think is pretty cool.)</p>
<p>We’ll be using Lines and Veils, the X Card, and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct: <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. The sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players. I’ll send a group email about a week before our first session to confirm interest, share play materials, etc. Please sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend.</p>
<p>Open access time for sign-ups is 2pm 20 July AEST.</p>
