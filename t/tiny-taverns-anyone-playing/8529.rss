    <title>Tiny Taverns: anyone playing?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/tiny-taverns-anyone-playing/8529</link>
    <description>Has anyone here played Tiny Taverns?  It looks very cute.  I’ve not played anything in the Tiny Dungeon line, but this one looked very interesting to me so I backed it.
It’s a fun read and seems to be easy to get to the fun quickly.</description>
