    <description>**This is a practice event for Camp Capybara. However, I will probably run this game at a later date through Gauntlet Calendars or at an upcoming Gauntlet Community Open Gaming weekend. If you are interested in playing, feel free to drop me a line and we’ll see about reserving a spot or two!**

WELCOME... TO  ~~JURASSIC PARK~~  DINO ISLAND...

 ***Escape from Dino Island***  *is a thrilling adventure game about intrepid heroes trapped on an island overrun with creatures from a lost age—* ***dinosaurs!***

*Players take on the role of everyday people who are brave and competent, but also in over their head. The game is designed to help you create the kind of stories that are full of action and suspense, but in which fighting is rarely a good option.* *Will you escape with your life? And what kind of person will you become in your quest to survive? There’s only one way to find out…

 --Game Creators Sam Tung and Sam Roberts

The Game Creators also had this to say about themselves: *[We are] two similarly named friends who&#39;ve been collaborating and gaming together for years. Coming out of the film and television industry, we&#39;re suckers for adventure stories that blend survival, mystery, and intrepid heroes — like Jurassic Park, Lost, and Half-life — and we&#39;re excited to bring them to our — and your — gaming tables.*

**CW: PG-13-level violence/death, blood &amp; gore, attacks by and on dinosaurs. One of the playable classes is &quot;The Child.&quot; Safety tools will be used throughout the game and this content can be modified as needed!**

**System :**  Powered by The Apocalypse
**Duration :**  One 3-hour session
**Breaks :**  2 breaks at the top of each hour (5-10 minutes)
