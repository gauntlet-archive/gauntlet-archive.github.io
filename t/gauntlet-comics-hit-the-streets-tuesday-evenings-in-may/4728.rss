    <description>## In celebration of my book hitting print and winning an award, I&#39;m running some  *Hit the Streets: Defend the Block*  for Gauntlet Comics!

![](upload://spJnD4gBnXoMqOYLcOWaTgi2Aak.jpeg)

The vacant streets below your apartment echo back a hard truth...your neighborhood, it isn&#39;t safe anymore, is it? How did this happen so quickly? The city is going down. You see it. Everyone does. Crime is everywhere, corruption around every corner, and people are stuck.

Your super-powered abilities mean you have a responsibility to do something about it, but you can&#39;t fight back alone. This neighborhood needs more than one person to take up the struggle. With powers big and small, your team may be the last hope this neighborhood has. If you can&#39;t save it, no one will.

In  *Hit the Streets: Defend the Block* , you and your friends will create the neighborhood where your Super-Powered Beings live and work. You&#39;ll create rivals who represent the threats to your home, and you&#39;ll power up to defend. your. block....are you ready?

(A seat in this series is reserved for Sherri Stewart)
