    <title>Codex - Leviathan Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-leviathan-miscellany/5558</link>
    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Leviathan! This one is called “Three Dozen Things at the Bottom of the Ocean.” 

Submissions should be no more than 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here in the replies, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please do not submit any entries with sexist imagery (we won’t publish it).

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

For this miscellany, we’re looking for things that are fantastical, mysterious, and/or horrifying. Your entries can be people, places, or things. Here are some examples:

“Old King Venradon was a cruel and malignant ruler, and eventually overthrown by his people when they could tolerate his depravities no more. Knowing that his baleful priests would try to resurrect him and place him back on the throne, the revolutionaries cut off Venradon’s head, put it in a box sealed with magical wax, and threw it in the ocean. Venradon’s priests still undertook their dark rites on their lord’s behalf, and now Venradon’s muffled screams disturb passing fish while his body flails wildly in his ancestral tomb.” 

“Scientists have recently detected the presence of a strange new metal near the ocean floor, perhaps released from the earth as the result of tectonic movement. In truth, the metal is from a spacecraft that entered our atmosphere many thousands of years ago, crashing deep into the sea, and only now being dislodged from the crust as its crew awakens from cryosleep and attempts to bring it back online.” 

“The tales rarely speak of Baba Yaga’s sister, who lives deep in the ocean, in a house made of coral and seaweed that moves around the seafloor on giant octopus tentacles.”

<p>Beneath the waves is a different part of the supply chain, less well known.  An enormous blue glaucus (Glaucus atlanticus) spends its languid days scooping up young mollusks drifting past.  It imbues each with a bit of its own indigo pigment, then casts them into the current.  The glaucus grows a bit more pale with each passing century.<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="//gauntlet-discourse-store.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/45d8ae8277ddc2a92f3c6ef1ad6c5181803747a3.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/9XTboAq6R06jRaZhsDgKUJViTTl.jpeg?dl=1" title="image" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="//gauntlet-discourse-store.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/4/45d8ae8277ddc2a92f3c6ef1ad6c5181803747a3.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="9XTboAq6R06jRaZhsDgKUJViTTl" width="636" height="500" data-small-upload="//gauntlet-discourse-store.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/4/45d8ae8277ddc2a92f3c6ef1ad6c5181803747a3_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">

              <p>We have all heard tale of Atlantis, that beautiful city lost beneath the waves, but few talk about her sister city, Pacifica, who remains afloat. You can visit Pacifica, though getting ashore is difficult - the coast is lined with boats of every shape and size, all long abandoned. The buildings are beautiful, and filled with precious offerings. But, it’s best you stop your ears with wax if you choose to visit - Pacifica lives in tribute to the goddess Tristitia, who was driven mad with grief for her sister. She cries beneath the city, and those who hear her voice tend to dive into Pacifica’s central well in their eagerness to console her.</p>

<p>My dad was lost on a fishing trip when I was young, so my mom would take me clamming with her every night. We’d walk barefoot on the beach, looking for the bubbles between our toes that marked the presence of the critters. Sometimes I’d be so engrossed in the texture of the sand and the barking of the seals all around that I’d lose track of my mom. I always thought it was just my negligence, until one dawn I saw her shucking the sealskin. She saw me see her, and shrugged the skin back on, crying, running back into the waves. Reckon both my parents are lost at sea now, and soon as I can find the right skin, I will be too.</p>

              <p>If, while walking on the beach, you find a conch shell apparently carved from obsidian, I’d urge you not to listen to it. All shells contain the roar of the waves, but the darkest ones contain the voices that murmur beneath them. Those who hear the voices can listen to nothing else, and while they may be restrained on shore long enough to live a full life, it will not be a happy one, and it’s far more merciful to let them shrug off their clothes and walk into the water.</p>

Some talk about the brief glimpses they have of the pearly white sand that lines the seafloor, too deep to reach by diving but sometimes bared by the strongest winds. In truth, that is not sand, but rather the pearly white thighs of the great mother, who sleeps there beneath the waves, her breathing driving the tides.</p>

Far from the sun’s light: a chair, a side table, a tea cup, shelves, and volumes of books hosting a riot of desaturated corals and translucent slimes.
