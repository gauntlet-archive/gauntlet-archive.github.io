If you are RSVPed for the March 31 session of Boy Problems, please do not RSVP for this until general RSVPs open.

This one-shot is scheduled for a maximum of 4 hours and will be recorded to share if all players consent. General RSVPs begin on March 13, 2019 at 5:00 PM Eastern US time.

[Boy Problems](https://boyproblems.myportfolio.com) is a Carly Rae Jepsen-themed heist one-shot game by Colin Cummings adapted from John Harper&#39;s Lasers and Feelings.

It is many years into the future. Renowned Canadian pop artist, Carly Rae Jepsen (CRJ) has a vault of 200 unreleased songs that have been kept from the public. Who&#39;s got &#39;em? Turns out, the President and CEO of the New NorthAm Federated Commercestate. Hired by an anonymous sponsor, your team of highly trained individuals will raid the NNFC capitol building (formerly the Interscope Center in Santa Monica, CA) to retrieve said item. 

To make the most of our night, [safety tools](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html) in use for this game will include the Open Door and the X-Card, and a content discussion establishing Lines and Veils will be held prior to recording.

If this is the first time you&#39;re playing a Gauntlet Hangout, please review the [inclusivity policy](http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
