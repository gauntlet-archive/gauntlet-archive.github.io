    <description>Your team of agents saved the world, but a few things didn&#39;t go according to plan, and now the boss wants some answers. In this session we&#39;ll be playing Mission: Accomplished by Jeff Stormer, the game of super spies and office meetings. You&#39;ll join your fellow agents in the conference room for a debriefing, where you&#39;ll try to shift the blame for your team&#39;s mistakes onto your colleagues, and hopefully get promoted to that sweet corner office.

Each session is scheduled for three hours, and will be recorded with the consent of all participants. There are two one-shot sessions, so it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you sign up for the other session. In session 2, all of the secret agents will be cats.

We will be using the X-Card and Lines and Veils, along with the Open Door policy being in effect. This series is operating under the Gauntlet&#39;s inclusivity policy.

Session 1: [date=2020-03-19 time=20:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2020-03-19 time=23:59:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;], Standard Rules: [https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M0o2yLILVE4eYQc0h2W](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com%2Fevent-detail%2F-M0o2yLILVE4eYQc0h2W&amp;v=3)

              <p>Hello Stentor,<br>
I am new to the Gauntlet though I have listened to Pocket Sized Play, and have seen a couple videos, including the first session of yours. I was wondering what I need to do to prepare for tomorrows game? What video chat do you use? So I can make sure i have it downloaded.<br>
Thanks Bunches<br>
