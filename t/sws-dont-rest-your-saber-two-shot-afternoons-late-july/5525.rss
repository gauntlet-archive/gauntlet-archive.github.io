## The fledgling New Jedi Order on Rodia led by Master Nova Kallos sent you two Jedi deep into enemy territory on a dangerous mission. Someone notified your enemies before you arrived, and things have gone from bad to karking terrible really quickly. Your starship is a flaming wreck, alarms are blaring, and  *they*  are on your trail. Hunted and hated, you&#39;ll have to fight your way through using everything you have, or you will truly &quot;become one with The Force&quot; (that&#39;s code for &quot;dead&quot;, sleemo).

**Don&#39;t Rest Your Saber**  is a sleek, dangerous little game, where your players are Jedi with superpowers, fighting—and using— their Attachments and sometimes...  *the Dark Side*  to stay alive for just one more night in a world that wants your head on a force pike.

*(this game is a loving reskin of Fred Hicks&#39; Don&#39;t Rest Your Head).*

A seat has been reserved for David MK.
