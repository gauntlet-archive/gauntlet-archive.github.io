    <description>***For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you haven’t played in one of my regular Gauntlet games before or are part of a marginalised community (self-defined).***

Ten years from now, the world we knew has been destroyed. Humanity is in chains, reduced to helpless servitude before the so-called Fair Folk. Our armies have fallen, our leaders have sworn fealty to the cruel and capricious Seelie Queen, and the very concept of freedom has been erased from human consciousness. Only one last, desperate chance to save the world: a tiny band of anti-fey rebels, the last front of human resistance, will use the faeries’ magick against them, travelling back to a moment in history before it was too late, to try and weaken the fey powers before they rise. 

In a year and a day, the Queen’s armies will arrive and the end of humankind will begin - unless you can stop her. You play a time-travelling resistance fighter or one of their recruits in the present day, travelling our world and theirs, from steamy nightclubs and celebrity glamour to festering swamplands and sleepy small towns, looking for anything that could give you an advantage in the terrible battle to come. 

Fate of the Faerie Queen is a reskin of Fate of Cthulhu, adapting the story of time-travelling resistance to a monstrous apocalypse for a game of fey brutality, intrigue and seduction. It uses a version of the Fate rules but you don’t need to be familiar with them, all rules will be taught in play. My take on the fey here is heavily inspired by the Brothers Grimm and contemporary reimaginings of classic fairy tales; the tone I’ll be aiming for is a kind of creepy, campy adventure game with horror elements. 

Subject matter for this game will include horror and violence, references to alcohol and drug use, and outrageous fairy sensuality. And monstrous fey probably implies peril and perhaps harm to children - witches threatening to eat them, say. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the sessions will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

Sessions will run on Streamyard, using Rollwithme for dice, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll record and post the sessions if players consent. I’ll send an email a week before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials. 

Being able to attend all/most sessions is ideal but not required. You&#39;ll need to sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend. I have a prior commitment on February 25th, so there’s no session that week. 

Open access time for sign ups is 8.30am 20/11 AEDT.
