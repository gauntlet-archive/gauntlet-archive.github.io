              <p>Outside of what Alun mentioned above (You have no idea how giddy I got when I heard Radim Zacpal’s name uttered again!), I have two narrative experiences I couldn’t possibly choose between - and one just Gauntlet community experience.</p>
<p>I’ll start with the community experience; in <a class="mention" href="/u/ludovico_alves">@Ludovico_Alves</a> game of Microscope where we created <em>The City of the Ram,</em> one of our players (Parham) was sight impaired and largely used a text-audio reader to interact.<br>
Microscope can be quite a heavy text game but I was very happy (and I think he was too) with how we accommodated this player; offers to recap information verbally, to provide the broad overview that we could see at a glance of our history, all were welcomed and the player never seemed to be out of the loop despite the vast differences in what we could all access at a glance. Not only did we have an amazing experience (love Ludo’s idea for Scenes, where each player pitches an outcome to the Scene’s question rather than just the suggestor dictat) but it was a really positive, supportive experience.</p>
<p>Narrative ones now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Generation Xtra</strong> by <a class="mention" href="/u/ferret">@Ferret</a>  - My do-gooder Legacy winning over <a class="mention" href="/u/erez87">@erez87</a> 's Delinquent. I usually play ‘good’ characters who have some real destructive tendencies or obnoxious character quirks. This time (only time?) I played a straight up hero trying his best, and I loved every brief fleeting moment with <a class="mention" href="/u/leandrop">@LeandroP</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/tylom">@Tylom</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/patrickk">@patrickK</a>. From my Legacy’s rival with the Beacon to the looming threat of our Doomed and the hidden secret/shame of our Monstrous, I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction to Masks. Winning over the Delinquent was the moment where we felt like a Team, in spite and because of the rivalry and drama. And it got me into <em>X-Statix</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urban Shadows: 1950s LA Noir</strong> by <a class="mention" href="/u/david_walker">@David_Walker</a> - So much I loved here. My character was the underdog amongst <a class="mention" href="/u/pearl_zare">@Pearl_Zare</a>, Caroline and <a class="mention" href="/u/davidmorrison">@DavidMorrison</a>, all of whom had far more cards to play than my poor schmuck psychic. But I got to run wild with the Oracle’s powers, playing all my friends off against our enemies (and each other…) without ever fully showing my hand. At first everyone thought I was a monster with all the secrets and lies, but by the end, I left the shadows of LA just a little brighter than before. Not bad for a schmuck like Ritchie, who never ever succeeded on his dice rolls… shame about Lee though. But at least I helped that mutt save his pack.</p>
</li>
</ul>

              <p>Playing World Wide Wrestling at last Gauntlet Con was an incredible blast. I played a hardcore aggro London wrestler (KILLA KING) and drew blood!</p>
<p>But honestly the best time was a Monsterhearts hack by <a class="mention" href="/u/luiz">@Luiz</a> where we incorporated music into scenes, and we did a great romantic tension scene to “Should I Stay or Should I Go”.</p>

<p>Mr Monet’s character arc in <a class="mention" href="/u/tylom">@Tylom</a>’s Gauntlet League wrestling game.   possibly my favourite character that i’ve played and the most emotional i’ve got in a game as we watch their broken man try and find a way to do the best by his teenage daughter while battling his own demons and heartache.</p>

              <p>There were so many, it’s really hard to say!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot Guys Making Out: Star Trek. I was Spock, and I was able to logically conclude that, yes, I loved Kirk.</li>
<li>Trophy: Writer’s Retreat. The one game where I was literally shaking because of all the tension. And I ran it.</li>
<li>Melody of a Never-Ending Summer: We played teenagers opening up to each other over one summer, and then they had to go home again. Such a beautiful game. Everybody cried.</li>
<li>Hearts of Wulin: After intrigues, murder, poison, a zombifyed mother and many betrayals, my character reluctantly became Empress.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the ass-kickers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schatten im Zwielicht (Shadows in Twilight): Epic battle against the forces of Evil, and my fire mage blew himself up to take out the Invincible Legion.</li>
<li>Masks: The Suits. More epic battle against an alien menace, and my Weapon really touched a nerve there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry. I can’t decide, and I forgot Rider’s Last Ride, and the New Year thing where we hunted a white hart …</p>

<p>Mind you Radim gallivanting around the fallen castle, eating flesh and cavorting in blood, was also <em>great</em>. As was Sharpe reuniting a broken family, or blackmailing a Fey queen… or Blacwyn fighting his way through the King in Flint to banish him, leaping in front of his friends to save Synhamm … Ah memories.</p>
