    <title>Folklore and Fable Inspiration for Big Bad Jam?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/folklore-and-fable-inspiration-for-big-bad-jam/1766</link>
    <description>There is a game jam, Big-Bad-Jam, https://itch.io/jam/big-bad-game-jam, that I would like to participate in...but I&#39;m running into a road block and don&#39;t have a folk tale, fable or fairy tale to use as inspiration.

I know there&#39;s the incredible [Myths and Legends](https://www.mythpodcast.com) podcast which has tags for [Fairy Tale](https://www.mythpodcast.com/tag/fairy-tale/) and [Fairy Tales](https://www.mythpodcast.com/tag/fairy-tales/), which I am currently browsing through.

I&#39;m also going to reading through the thread on [media you wish was an RPG](https://discourse.funtimers.club/t/what-piece-of-media-do-you-wish-was-an-rpg/1308), just in case it points me to something too.

There is also a separate [folklore game jam](https://itch.io/jam/folklorejam) going on simultaneously... so you might be able to submit something for both of them.

What are some of your favorites? What are some that you think might be ripe for an RPG? Are there just other images or adapted stories that you love that might be useful as inspiration?</description>

              <p>So this might be a little too long for either jam, but there is a new storybundle that is all about fairy tales, Bad Fairy Tales.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who doesn’t love a bad fairy? Let’s be honest, it’s always the naughty ones who hold our interest! From old fairy stories gathered by collectors like Grimm or Yakuma, to Brian Froud’s gorgeous, detailed illustrations of pixies and kobolds, to Disney’s depiction of Maleficent, fairies have inhabited our cultural consciousnesses the world over for centuries, in our childhoods and dreamworlds, into our adult years and waking moments.</p>

<p>Another podcast to browse is <a href="https://spiritspodcast.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Spirits podcast</a>, which recounts a myth or piece of folklore and then pairs it with a mixed drink each episode.</p>
<p>And perhaps a particular vein of inspiration for this jam is American Tall Tales, with their over-the-top characters like Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, or Joe Magarac (doubly fictitious, as it seems his supposed oral tradition was also a fabrication!).</p>
