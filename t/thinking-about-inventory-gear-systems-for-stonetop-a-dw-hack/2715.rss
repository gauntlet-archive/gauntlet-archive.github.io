    <title>Thinking about inventory &amp; gear systems for Stonetop (a DW hack)</title>

    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about gear and inventory systems for  *Stonetop* , by &quot;hearth fantasy&quot; hack of Dungeon World. I&#39;d be interested in any questions and feedback y&#39;all might have.

https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2019/07/more-noodling-on-stonetops-gear.html

Specific questions, for anyone who gets through the whole thing. :slight_smile: 
* Does the proposed system seem intuitive? Fun?
* Any glaring holes?
* Does anything seem unnecessarily complex? If so, how would you simplify it?

Thanks!</description>
