After the death of Palpatine, Grand Moff Zsinj was recognized by many as the most powerful of the post-Imperial warlords. In fact, his official title of &quot;Warlord of the Empire&quot; popularized the term &quot;warlord&quot; for the renegades who broke away from the crumbling Empire, when in the initial chaos following the Battle of Endor he proclaimed loyalty to the Empire and used his legal title to foster an appearance of legitimacy.

In this two-session series, you&#39;ll be playing as the crew of an AT-ST in Zsinj&#39;s Empire, part of the warlord&#39;s army fighting to keep control of the Quelii Oversector against other warlords, the forces of the New Republic, and indigenous populaces. In this game, we&#39;ll deal with the idea of being part of a military force on the other side of &quot;the good guys&quot;. Your characters aren&#39;t evil, they&#39;re caught in the remnants of an Empire that never gave them a choice to be anything other than its soldiers. During character creation, we&#39;ll how each PC became a soldier in the Empire, and what they thought when they first heard Palpatine was dead.

Are you bad guys? Are you misled? Are you misunderstood? Let&#39;s play to find out!

Hell on Legs is a Star Warsy reskin of a tank RPG from Newstand Press called *Hell on Treads*. *Hell on Treads* is a small, cooperative roleplaying game about the crew of an armored fighting vehicle.

Greg Gelder is a special guest for this series.
