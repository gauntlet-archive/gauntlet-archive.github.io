***This is essentially a playtest, so please only sign up if you&#39;re okay with that!*** This hack of Changeling: The Lost was created by Lowell Francis, and has its PbtA DNA from Urban Shadows, Masks, and Hearts of Wulin. Play does assume some PbtA knowledge.

Attendance at all sessions is encouraged but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. This session is scheduled for 3 hours. I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance. Sessions will be recorded through Zoom but only released for public consumption if all players consent.

***Changelings, also known as the Lost, are humans who were abducted by the Fae. Unlike most who suffer this fate, the Lost have managed to find their way back through the Hedge to the mortal world, but their time in the Faerie realm (Arcadia) has irrevocably changed their bodies, minds and souls. A Changeling&#39;s true, inhuman mien is hidden by his Mask, the aspect of Fae magic that makes Faerie creatures and artefacts seem mundane to mortal eyes. Very few Changelings are able to reclaim their old lives, or make entirely new ones without retaining ties to the fae realm.***

You can find Lowell&#39;s write up on the game here: http://bit.ly/2pAlKHa. That&#39;s an earlier version of the system, we&#39;ll be playing with an updated version.

**Touchstones:** Fables (the comics), Mirrormask (the movie), Elsewhere by Neil Gaiman, Pan&#39;s Labyrinth (the movie).

**Content warning:** All changelings have gone through significant trauma during their time in the Faerie realm, and dark subject matter will often come up. Forced servitude, trauma related behaviors, fae-tinged horror may come up.

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
