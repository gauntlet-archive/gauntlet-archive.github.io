<p>Following my operation this collection is a bit delayed, and thanks to the zine quest it totals more than 150 projects of whom more than 70 are actual games. Thus I decided to split the collection in three parts, the other two being:<br>
<a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-1-of-3/" rel="nofollow noopener">Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 1 of 3</a><br>
<a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-3-of-3-zine-quest/" rel="nofollow noopener">Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 3 of 3 – Zine Quest</a></p>
<p>The Zine Quest brought up an astounding amount of new, whole tabletop rpg games, thus lets get to them. The <b>Dirt RPG</b> offers a fantasy setting after an apocalypse with a quite interesting d6 system. The description is interesting and it looks are quite intruiging. You’ll find another kind of post-apocalypse in <b>Snake People</b>. I consider the narrative game quite interesting, despite the inherent strangeness of snakes. Well, and if you are fascinated by the mechanics of „snake eye“ rolls, the <b>Snakeyes Gaming System</b> has you covered.<br>
Maybe you like to have a game in the style of the Westworld series, along with a dashing dose of the Great Gatsbys charme? I certainly do and did back <b>The Gaslight Club</b>, which is powered by a Blades in the Dark inspired system. If you prefer the series Love Boat, you’ll got to take a cruise with the <b>The Love Ballon</b>. A gm-less game thats basically steered cooperatively. Well, or you want to play a game of pranking people, in which <b>Funny Freakout</b> has been Forged in the Dark for you.<br>
There is of course always the option for some Fantasy games. Like creating magical cities in <b>i’m sorry did you say street magic</b> – that’s create them and explore them. In your prefered genre, vignette or campaign style and without a GM. You don’t need a GM for <b>ALL SKATE FANTASY</b> either, but get normal heroic fantasy for „party people“. Which I take means that it is lighthearted. For a fun, fast game you should check out <b>Dump Quest</b>. Creating your game with some „ad-libbing“ fun and maybe destroying the zine in the process.<br>
Horror? Would be the ad-libbed word that covers the next three games. If are enticed by the deep sea horror of William Hope Hodgsons <b>Grey Seas Are Dreaming Of My Death</b> should be right up your ally for a fatal oneshot. You might prefer to be a monster, as <b>THEY FEED ON FEAR</b> presents. Following the title you’ll have to instill fear in others to feed. Which is done with quite some style! Though I wouldn’t say <b>DON’T LOOK</b>. Which is a game in which characters actually have to have fear to survive. Though maxing the fear by looking at the stuff appears to be a bad idea.<br>
I can’t say that <b>Corruption of the Black-Hearted</b> isn’t horror. As you play people who try to be heroes yet might just go one step to far and become monstrous. An interesting idea for an OSR game that I do consider a bit meta. Though <b>Disk Horse#1: Off to the Races</b> is definitively more meta’er. As you’ll be playing a PbtA style tabletop rpg game about creating tabletop rpgs. Which I find very difficult to kinda grasp. Well and the most meta-test game is <b>In Our Own Wor(l)ds</b>. Which addresses the fascination, creation and exchange of game zines as a zine. Yikes, quite a braintwist.<br>
For the Honor is rather straight forward. Looks like She-Ra, got half of She-Ras slogan, colorful as She-Ra and saying it’s inspired by She-Ra. The gm-less game is right up my ally. As is Princess World which too takes inspiration from the She-Ra series and you’ll play cool &amp; competent princesses.<br>
If that’s to much color, maybe get back to the cold of space where noone hears you scream or chant like in <b>INVOCCULTAS – Conduits of the Void</b>. In which space cultist call upon the eldritch gods in a interestingly card based game. <b>YourVerse</b> on the other hand rather enables you to create your own science fiction setting while <b>Terranary</b> sees you struggling human, intergalactic intruiges for which it provides a d12 system. Maybe your more up for a solo experience, that might be played with others but doesn’t have to, in which case you should check out the <b>Science Vessel of Dr. Uaerom</b>.<br>
Your character vessel of choice might be an animal. Where <b>Winter Harvest</b> offers you the role of animals who trying to build a home, community and live their lifes. It could be that last collections pigeon game didn’t fill your needs for the airborne raths where <b>Dirty Town</b> has you covered. Well, and from rats to rodents to vermin, you should check out <b>Hivesworn: Queensfall</b> if insects are your calling.<br>
There is always the option to have some normal, nice Urban Fantasy. Where I would like to recommend <b>Draculola</b> with a passion! The game from Austria is addressed to kids – and those who feel like playing a lighthearted game – in which players assume the roles of vampires and other „monsters“. Just that the monsters ain’t evil but do try to make the world a better place. I personally grew up on tv series like „The little Vampire“ and love the genre, which had be back the project in a minute. It’s really cool and cute. Take a look. It’s a heartwarming game somewhat reminiscent of the likes of „Golden Sky Stories“. If you like more mundane Urban Fantasy directed towards older gamers, check out the <b>Mundane Lost</b>. Which combines the Stepford Wives with Outer Limits and a dash of Forbidden Zone to form an interesting small PbtA game set in a kinda 50s. Then there’s <b>Heaven Has No Taste; And Other True Statements</b> which will put you in the role of angles and demons on earth in romantical entanglements. Basically providing the plot of a standard CW-series.<br>
Maybe you are more of the opinion „A game within like 30 to 60 zine pages? ONLY one? How can that be?!“. In which case <b>StoryHunter Alphas</b> gets you 4 games with changing gm’s, you can get three different solo experiences in <b>Alone On A Journey</b> or 7 short poem based games in <b>Sedentary Dances</b>. Maybe two are fine with <b>This Thing We Started/The Brokenhearted</b>? Who knows.<br>
There are many, many more projects. Like the <b>Light of the Setting Sun</b> Western Setting, <b>Artifices, Deceptions &amp; Dilemmas</b> to integrate exactly those into your games or system supplements like <b>The Era Zone 2020</b>.<br>
You’ll find fhose and many more project here:</p>
