              <p>Hi Jason. If you go to the posts section of our page you can scroll down a bit to find a message to $8 Patrons with all the instructions you need.</p>

              <p>Check in with <a class="mention" href="/u/jasoncordova">@jasoncordova</a> if you don’t have Slack access and/or RSVP priority. At least the RSVP priority has to be manually switched (and I can’t remember about Slack). Otherwise…keep your eye on the calendar!<br>
Once you’re in the Slack, turn notifications on <span class="hashtag">#g_hangouts</span> (but <em>don’t</em> post in the channel unless you’re listing a game or replying <em>in thread</em> to something) and # need_players — those are the quickest ways to see games. I would also suggest getting the Discourse app if you’re into notifications and turning them on for <a class="hashtag" href="/c/6-gauntlet-hangouts">#<span>gauntlet-hangouts</span></a> here.</p>
<p>For games, <span class="hashtag">#g_hangouts</span> on Slack and <a class="hashtag" href="/c/6-gauntlet-hangouts">#<span>gauntlet-hangouts</span></a> here in the forums are the listings for all Hangouts games (they’re the same across Slack and the forums, but Slack has better notifications) and # need_players is all pick up games and playtesting.</p>
