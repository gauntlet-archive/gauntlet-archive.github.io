    <title>Kingdom 2nd Ed.: Banner of the Black Serpent</title>

    <description>We will play the second edition of the RPG Kingdom, which is currently in playtest. In this game, players portray a pivotal character in a community who cooperate or clash to shape that community&#39;s fate.

This two-part series is focused on the Banner of the Black Serpent:

The Banner of the Black Serpent is an order of knights who fought valiantly for the realm. As a reward for the blood they shed, they were granted lands, strongholds, and the right to bear arms in the realm. Yet they stand beholden to no other lord.

Now they are an army apart from the normal feudal hierarchy. Do they protect the throne that rewarded them? Or do they sell their swords to the highest bidder? Do they fight for gold, glory, or the honor of the Banner?

This Kingdom is the order of knights, their men-at-arms, and associated servants. Their holdings are inside the realm they fought for (a feudal kingdom), but in play we will explore the decisions and fate of the Banner, not the realm around it.
