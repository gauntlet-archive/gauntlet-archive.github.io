All the adults say life used to be peaceful. Since you were born, though, you haven’t known anything but this isolated city and the warning sound that goes off right when you think you wouldn’t hear it anymore. All you know are the IMMINENT THREATS. Like any other child, you wanted to special and you are. Whether you applied, were specially selected or raised to be part of it, it seems inevitable now, no matter how much you might fight against it. The PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION is your home, the CUSTODIAN the closest thing to a parent you have and your BLADE, a weapon only you can wield. Not everyone can be a HILT and you are both loved and hated for that.
But none of that matters. Your job is to save humanity. No big deal, right?

These are five sessions of *[HILT // BLADE](https://agonysonggames.itch.io/hilt-blade)* by Darren Brockes, a love letter to mecha anime. This is a playtest. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend.

We’ll use [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/) and [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/). I’ll email all players about a week before the session with necessary information and links.

**Content Warnings:** mental/emotional strain, teenagers in danger, violence, physical harm of bodily surrogates, pseudopsychology
**Safety Tools:** [Script Change](http://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/), [Lines and Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913), the [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)
