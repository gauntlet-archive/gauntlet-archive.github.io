    <description>**Comrades: Hell&#39;s Rebels**
**When**: Thursdays in August, 8:00 PM EDT (UTC-4)
**Sessions**: 4
**Players**: 4
**Content Warning**s: Tyranny, oppression, public executions, devil-worship
*The rebellion begins! The city of Kintargo has long been a safe haven for artists, free thinkers, and those marginalized by the oppressive government of Infernal Empire of Cheliax, but now the city has been placed under martial law by Inquisitor Barzalai Thrune. When a protest turns into a riot, a group of rebels comes together to form an organized resistance against the devil-worshiping government. But can these rebels survive long enough to establish a true resistance movement? Or will they become the latest victims publicly executed by the Thirce-Damned House of Thrune?*

This is a game of *Comrades: A Revolutionary RPG*, set in the fantasy realm of the *Pathfinder RPG Campaign Setting*. The adventure is inspired by the 6-part PFRPG adventure series &quot;Hell&#39;s Rebels,&quot; especially the modules *In Hell&#39;s Bright Shadow* by Crystal Frasier, *Dance of the Damned* by Richard Pett, and *A Song of Silver* by James Jacobs.

**System**: *Comrades: A Revolutionary RPG* is a &quot;Powered by the Apocalypse&quot; game by W.M. Akers. Because the setting is a magical world, we&#39;ll be grafting in some magic moves from Monster of the Week.
**Technology**: We will be using the GM&#39;s Zoom for video chat, a shared dice roller, and a shared Google Sheet as a character keeper.
**RSVP Open Access**: 6/24/2021, 6:00 PM EDT
**Recording**: With the consent of the players, we will record this session. The facilitator will make the recording available to players for review, and with their consent, will post the video (or audio only if preferred) for public viewing.
**Experience Required**: None. All rules will be taught at the table. (Familiarity with the Pathfinder campaign setting may be helpful.)
**Safety Tools**: The X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and Open Door are all in-play. We will review these tools at the start of the session.
