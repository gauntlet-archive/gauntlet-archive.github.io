    <title>Durance: Life and Death Somewhere Very Far from Home Fridays in June</title>

    <description>From the &quot;What is this game about?&quot; section:

&quot;On a remote planet far from civilization, the worst criminal scum from a dozen star systems have been dumped, charged with building new lives under the watchful eye of Authority. Within a brutal hierarchy of savagery and servility, convicts and guards alike must make hard choices. Every colonist has their own code of conduct and their own aspirations—aspirations that invariably come at the expense of others. This dangerous new world is too small for everyone to succeed. In fact, it may well be too small for anyone to succeed. Only the shrewdest, the toughest and the luckiest will get a chance to find out. Will you be among them?&quot;

Durance is a gmless roleplaying game by Jason Morningstar in which players take on the roles of authority and prisoners in a deep space prison colony on a planet that was never meant to support human life. At times, you will be asked to play one of your two notable characters (one from the side of authority and one from the side of the prisoners), and at others, you will be asked to take on the role of guide to the other players, asking provocative questions and pushing conflicts to the razor edge that will cut our throats. Durance is a game about making promises to yourself about what you would never do to survive, and being forced to break them.

This event is scheduled to run for 2 and 1/2 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

There will be 3 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
