Cute Boys Holding Hands is a game about a budding relationship between two boys at a South Yorkshire grammar school in the Summer of 1984, at the height of the Miners Strike. In some ways polar opposites, the boys are united by their outsider status at the school. Between us, we will play the two boys, Simon and Jack, their English teacher Miss Rayne, and Simon’s closest friend Jo. (If we are able to play two games, we will swap roles after the first) Each role has specific actions they are (or are not) able to take throughout the game, and we will play to find out how Simon and Jack’s relationship grows in physical and emotional intensity, and how they deal with the struggles in their lives.</p>

YOU ARE A SPACEFARING SCOUNDREL. You’ve blasted, cheated, swindled, double-crossed, charmed, and hyper- jumped your way across HALF THE GALAXY. But now, you’ve made a few bad decisions and gotten into some REAL TROUBLE. The one thing in all the universe that you really care about is in terrible danger, and keeping it safe might require the ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. Are you desperate enough to risk everything you have to SAVE WHAT MATTERS MOST?</p>

We’ll play in the setting of Forbearance, New Mexico, 1997, a dot-com boomtown haunted by digital monsters.  In the new economy, locals rely on freelancing and service jobs. A kid with a bike can get a courier gig. A smart and savvy enough kid could swing a QA job at one of the startups. And that’s to say nothing of the demons. Daemons? It’s unclear whether they were born on the Net or whether they’re infernal opportunists, but Dark Powers haunt the modem lines, offering wealth and power to those who can do their bidding. What do they want? Maybe just chaos.</p>

Unity Heights was a high tech, sleek neighborhood for the many “young professionals” working for the new headquarters of the shipping megacorp in the city. It was much celebrated, a seed of hope and renewal for the city.</p>
<p>That was 24 years ago. The seed? Corrupted.</p>
<p>Today, Unity Mutant Safe Zone are where the unwanted, the exploited, the acceptable target. The world is dying, the megacorp has changed headquarters again but still profits from exploitation of the inhabitants of Unity - perhaps even more as they are not even recognized as humans. The world crumbles away as capitalism keeps chugging along. You are mutants, the scapegoats for a crumbling system, blamed for everything; but you also have the tools to fix your communities and save your loved ones. As they fear you, they admit to the power for change your can wield.</p>

Imagine grand cathedrals. Spires scraping the heavens. Statues of alabaster and silver. A song echoing through stone corridors. The light of hope ensconced in a thousand torches, keeping the darkest nights at bay. Then imagine it all fell. Grand cathedrals, silent and empty. Spires, crumbling and broken. Statues dirty and tarnished. Song, forgotten and lost. A thousand torches, cold and dark. That is the world of Lastlife.</p>

Where did the missing wizard go? What does the weeping ghost want? Who are the bandits hiding in the sewer? What’s going on at the factory? <em>What is wrong with this place?</em></p>
<p>You probably didn’t plan to stay long in a dying mountain town full of smog and secrets. But here you are, so you might as well make the best of it and figure out what’s going on. Maybe somebody will even pay you for it.</p>
