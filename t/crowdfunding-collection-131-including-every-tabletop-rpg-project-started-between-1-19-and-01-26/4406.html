          <p>I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/01/26/crowdfunding-collection-131/" rel="nofollow noopener">Crowdfunding Collection #131, including every tabletop rpg project started between 1/19 and 01/26</a></b>.</p>
<p>With 41 projects started in a week the crowdfunding year is back in full swing, thus let’s start.</p>
<p><b>2 Women | 12 Games</b> by Elizabeth Chaipraditkul and Steffie de Vaan offers the titular dozen of games, which are already fully developed and will be collected into one book. The games cover a great range of fascinating topics and use rule light mechanics to up to bespoke rules. I couldn’t resist and backed it in a minute. I am as well enticed to back the <b>Trophy RPG</b>. First it offers a one-shot game about doomed trophy hunters. Second it offers a campaign game where the fate of the trophy hunters isn’t sealed from the get go. Last but not least it offers a really nifty setting book for the world the trophy hunters engage in. If you don’t like it as dark, maybe check out <b>Age of Ambition</b>. The setting at the verge from fantasy towards maybe something like the industrial age seems new and interesting. In regards of mechanices it uses the Saga Machine engine and offers lifepath based character creation. <b>World of Ere</b> might be your cup of tea if you like a nice steampunk game based on the OGL licence. I think it looks nice.<br>
If you like your game with a lot of technical integration, take a look at <b>Knuckledragger</b>. The concept looks interesting, apparently offering something like its own Roll20 platform – though it’s a bit to technical for me. <b>Legendaria 2020</b> on the otherhand provides a nice mixture between ttrpg and a more classical card- or boardgame.<br>
I’d rather like to express a stern warning regarding <b>Mafia Caporegime</b>. The IndieGoGo campaign runs parallel to a doomed Kickstarter, the creator doesn’t communicate and given that the IndieGoGo campaign will take your money directly… I am doubtful that you’ll see a game for it. After noticing the IndieGoGo thing I backed out of the Kickstarter.<br>
There are of course plenty more cool projects like the gamebook <b>Steam Highwayman III</b>. If you are a fan of GURPS, take a look at the sourcebook<b> Dungeon Fantasy Companion 2</b>. Take it fast, because it will end in just a few hours. There are cool projects like <b>Doom on the Warden</b> for Metamorphis Alpha or <b>Outpost 42</b> for Stars Without Numbers and many, many more cool adventures.<br>
Just take a look for yourself:</p>
