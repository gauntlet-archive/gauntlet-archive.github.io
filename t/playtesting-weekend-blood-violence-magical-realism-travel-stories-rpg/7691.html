          <p><strong>Game Pitch:</strong> They say the World is vast and uncertain, modern and ancient from dusk to dawn. The World is connected by travelers, like you moving in and out of distant Civilizations. These strange hollow lands speak to you and remind you of where you came from—why you’re with them, fellow Vagrants, you companions of the Road, and in this World. Each day brings new Hopes, Needs, and Fears—some you share, some you steal, perhaps one day you’ll know when it’s time to leave the Road behind you for Blood &amp; Violence.</p>
<p>Blood &amp; Violence is a tabletop roleplaying game of magical realism travel tales. A rare kind of people, called Vagrants, move between Civilizations along the Road searching for new Stories to learn and share throughout the World, with Hopes, Needs, and Fears as their companions. Eventually, Vagrants settle down as a Civilian, become a Legend, or wander forever as a Reaver along the Road. (Inspired by sources such as Kino’s Journey anime and Cormac McCarthy’s The Road movie.)</p>
<p>Vagrants come from all walks of life and any Civilization. They are people who, for whatever reason, have decided to leave their old life behind to travel along the Road. Many take on alter egos. Few use or share their real identities. Some ply old or pick up new trades. All Vagrants share Stories with those they meet for good or ill results, changing lives and reshaping the world.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Playtesting will focus on world and character creation and then actual play, time permitting.</p>
<p>This event is scheduled to run for 2 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.</p>
