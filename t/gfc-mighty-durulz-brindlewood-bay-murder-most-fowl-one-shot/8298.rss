    <description>**NOTE: This single-session game is part of Gauntlet Facilitator Camp Mighty Durulz. All three seats are initially reserved for our camp counsellor (Lowell), camper Dana, and camp visitor Sherri. Once participants have signed up, the wait list is available for general sign-ups.**

**System:** Brindlewood Bay (no familiarity necessary, rules will be taught. See below for more information)

**Scenario:** Murder Most Fowl by Amanda Mullins

&gt; After yet another murder in Brindlewood Bay (this time at The North American Avicultural Association Aviary Show) the Mavens are searching for the killer in order to save the reputation and life of the accused – a parrot.

**CW:** Possible themes include murder, birds, murderbirds, body horror

**Duration:** 2.5 hrs (with an additional 30 minutes for feedback)

**Breaks**: 5-10 min breaks on the hour

**Venue**: Lowell will set up a Zoom for us

**Recording:** Only with permission

**Safety Tools**: Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, Open Door, Script Change
[This game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)

**From The Gauntlet:** &quot;Brindlewood Bay is a roleplaying game about a group of elderly women—members of the local Murder Mavens mystery book club—who frequently find themselves investigating (and solving!) real-life murder mysteries. They become increasingly aware that there are supernatural forces that connect the cases they are working on and, in particular, a cult dedicated to the dark, monstrous aspect of the goddess Persephone will come to vex them. 

The game is directly inspired by the television show Murder, She Wrote, but also takes inspiration from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, “cozy” crime dramas, and American TV shows from the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s.&quot;
