              <p>Did you guys see it? There are patreon previews. It has this very interesting concept where it is the protagonist/PC player that has the responsibility of pushing the story forward, and the other players have the shared responsibility of responding and being creative. It feels almost GM-less in this respect.</p>
<p>You can see so much stuff coming together from apocalypse world, sundered lands and several prototypes they created. I am excited about seeing this game published.</p>
