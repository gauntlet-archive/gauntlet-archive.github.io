On the blog this week I put together a *Hearts of Wulin* post which talks about the element resolution system, 36 Reasons Your Foe is a Higher Scale, and thoughts on combat framing.

**[Age of Ravens: Wulin Miscellany](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-wulin-miscellany)**

I&#39;m especially happy with that list. One of our goals for *Hearts of Wulin* is to offer a toolbox of ideas for GMs running the game. We&#39;ll have the usual GMing advice, but also I want lots of inspirational resources. Hope you dig it.</description>
