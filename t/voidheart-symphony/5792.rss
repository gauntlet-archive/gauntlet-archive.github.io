This is a run of eight sessions of Voidheart Symphony in October/November on Tuesday evenings (UK time). [Voidheart Symphony](https://ufo-mina.itch.io/voidheart-symphony) is a PbtA game of urban rebels standing up against the forces of corruption in a city and its shadowy otherworld by Mina McJanda. The game had a successful Kickstarter campaign last year, and this game will be played using the currently available playtest rules. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (September 3rd). This game will be played using the Open Table policy, so there is no need to commit to the full run - though this game will be played with a dedicated Session Zero so I would not advise only signing up for the first session. A place is reserved for Treb Ruddahan. Sessions will be three hours in length, and we will play using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). This game will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

In Voidheart Symphony you play as denizens of a modern city who balance the day-to-day struggle of surviving and making their world a better place with rebelling against the forces of oppression. The rebels make dangerous incursions into the Castle - a warped mirror of the city where the darkest desires of those who rule it are manifest. Entering the Castle the rebels take on powerful archetypal figures who can fight the minions of the Castle on an even footing, as they explore the mindscapes of the Castle&#39;s vassals and gain knowledge that can make lasting change back in the real world. Though, the rebels must take care that they do not become corrupted by the very power they seek to take from the hands of the Vassals. Voidheart Symphony takes inspiration from the Persona games among other influences, and has strong tarot themes throughout, as well as ideas of exploring the subconscious and embodying archetypes. The City and the people that make it up are also a core part of the game, and we will build out our city in our first session.

Content Warning: Violence and horror are both likely to appear in the game - primarily in the otherworldly Castle but also encroaching on &quot;real life&quot; - but we will avoid gratuitous gore. Interpersonal relationships are a key part of the game, and romance may well crop up, but again we will avoid any graphic sexual content. The game deals with issues of oppression and exploitation and we will likely draw on situations that may have affected people personally, though we will still avoid creating an uncomfortable environment for play, especially where it comes to discrimination based on race, sexuality, or gender. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
