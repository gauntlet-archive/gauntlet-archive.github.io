              <p>Overall good stuff, entertaining and well produced.</p>
<p>I deliberately listened to 01-Eight Legged She, then this episode so I could compare and contrast.</p>
<p>Audio quality-Excellent for both.<br>
Sourcing scene elements from players-Often.<br>
Gameplay-Happened quickly for both with a thorough but minimal introduction.<br>
Sharing the spotlight-Excellent for both.</p>
<p>Genre - Each scene was introduced by the MC with style and tone in the description, then the players advised of their responses-keeping with that style and tone.</p>
<p>The main thing that stood out is the intro/outro music for Keepers was super dramatic, it’s from an opera or something, but the Trophy one is more like a ballet, sombre in fitting with the tone.</p>
