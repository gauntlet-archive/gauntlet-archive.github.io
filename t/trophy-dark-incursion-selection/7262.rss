    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/trophy-dark-incursion-selection/7262</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to be running Trophy Dark soon for a group of friends but I am not familiar with any of the incursions and there are so many. Are there any that folks recommend where I know what content is in there so I can avoid lines for my players? If there is an existing list that would be great too.</description>

              <p>Devil Aim for Me is rock solid. I ran it twice, both times were amazing sessions.<br>
There’s an actual play on Jason Cordova’s YT which could be exelent prep.</p>

              <p>I ran “A Warm and Pleasant Hum” since I had a copy from an itch bundle. It got my players hooked. I immediately pre-ordered the game on backer kit. Incursions tend to be pretty short and I think as long as you keep the theme in mind, you should probably be ok. I’m certain there are some live plays on YouTube and I believe it was discussed on Fear of a Black Dragon.</p>

              <p>This is very neat! I appreciate your reply. I listened to some of Flocculent Cathedral from the podcast actual play. I’m unsure which I will run but I’m very into the system.</p>

I dug the <em>The Flocculent Cathedral,</em> which had a lot of rot and fungus elements, but I’m unsure what cautions the others might offer.</p>
