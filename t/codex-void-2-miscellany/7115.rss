    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-void-2-miscellany/7115</link>
    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Void 2. This one is called “Three Dozen MORE Incidents in Degoya County, New Mexico.” It&#39;s a sequel to the one published in the original Codex - Void. 

Degoya County is located in a remote corner of the state. And it has a bad, weird history. Tell us all about it, please.

Note: please avoid sexist imagery in your submissions—we don’t publish stuff like that.

Submissions should be no more than 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Here is the original &quot;Three Dozen Incidents in Degoya County New Mexico&quot;: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o8grHjEjuPLjsb7MlZxegDVXAh3Zo0vp/view?usp=sharing

Your submissions should include a date, as in the entries from the original miscellany, linked above. 

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).</description>

              <p>June 17, 1987: The “Lost Russian” incident. Air traffic controllers at the Degoya County Municipal Airport were surprised to see a plane suddenly appear on their radar, immediately followed by a frantic voice speaking in Russian over the radio. When asked for more information, the confused pilot switched to English and asked how far he was from “Tsentralny Airport” because he was getting low on fuel. The controller directed the pilot to the runway, where he landed a single-engine Soviet Yak-52 civilian airplane without incident. The pilot identified himself as Yuri Ivanovich Makarov of Saratov, Russia, USSR. When told his was in New Mexico, USA, Makarov expressed utter dismay: He claimed to have been returning to Saratov from Moscow when he entered heavy clouds and his instruments went haywire. Makarov had Soviet identification cards, including a civilian pilot’s license, but no passport. Local authorities contacted the US State Department and the Soviet embassy; Makarov was flown back to the Soviet Union at his request, but the pane was confiscated by the US Air Force. Authorities have never provided an explanation of how an airplane with a 350-mile range could suddenly find itself nearly 10,000 miles from its point of origin. The airplane’s current whereabouts are classified.</p>

She told the first person she saw a story about an early dusk, luminous blazes, and a campfire with a strange woman with too many teeth and long tales.

              <p>Over the 1930s, hobos frequently passed through Degoya County, mostly via freight trains. Before too long, symbols started to appear scratched on posts, trees, and the sides of buildings. Most of the symbols were typical “hobo signs” (e.g. a circle with an arrow meant, “this way”; three diagonal lines meant, “Danger - don’t stay here”; a cross meant, “food served after a sermon”). In the summer of 1936, a new sign appeared that defied explanation:a triskelion symbol of three sickle-like or question mark-shaped curves. Occasionally, this symbol would be embellished by yellow paint.</p>

On an empty church, the minister brought the microphone to two afflicted people, who swore and blasphemed before having their demons cast away. The final person, instead, started to intone a series of numbers and letters, using the NATO phonetic alphabet. The minister seemed confused but didn’t move the microphone. After sixteen characters were spoken, a voice was heard shouting from off-camera, the camera fell to the floor, and the livestream was cut off. Citizens of Dustpan do not recall the minister or the church.</p>

In 1983 a group of four grim faced European men arrived in the county seeking the shrine.  One stumbled back into town, three days later, eyewitnesses claimed he was wild-eyed, disheveled and refused all offers of help and is believed to have fled the state before he was apprehended.  The bodies of two more, later identified as Father Achille Vallone of the Jesuit order and Gunter Lange, a defrocked Benedictine, were found mutilated with machete cuts, pierced with chipped stone points, and crucified at the site of the destroyed shrine three days later, surrounded by Catholic ritual paraphernalia.  The fourth man’s whereabouts are unknown.</p>

The drones come within two miles of the Salt Still solar farm before releasing an antiquated W-82-0 Americium-241 sheathed nuclear artillery shell retrofitted as a bomb with crude sheet metal airfoils.  In the first confirmed act of nuclear terrorism, the blast destroys the solar farm, knocking out a third of the TAD’s power for most of the summer, and renders the entirety of  Degoya County a lifeless hot zone for 241 years. In May 2011 Mr. Neighbor’s entire 5th grade class of 34 students and one teacher all claim to have visions of the event after entering a sudden fugue state.  Their recollections and drawings were collected on a website and later self published book titled “The Degoya Mass Hallucination Event”, copies of which can be found at many flea markets throughout the Southwest.</p>

Many tried, all failed, their asses thoroughly kicked with not a hair out of place on her head. Skinny Jimmy tried last, and he never did quite understand what the other men were doing. So he walked up, hands extended in an invitation to dance, and the Traveller took his hands. Together they danced into the surrounding desert, the gold by now well beaten into a fine coating of leaf in the center of the square.</p>

              <p>In 1913 the Gareth &amp; Shub Silver Mining concern set up operations at Dragon Spine Bluff, with trainloads of equipment, workers, and marble blocks.  In 1916, after three years of extensive mining the company shut down, their promised marble bank and headquarters building never constructed.  Oddly later surveys have never found silver at Dragon Spine Bluff, and among the local caving community there are rumors of marble pillared halls and other strange edifices to be found deep in the sub-levels of the unstable Gareth &amp; Shub diggings.</p>

              <p>May 20, 1979: My dad attended the craft fair where he bought the skull. A vendor there was selling worked cow skulls, each delicately burnt, carved, and bejeweled. My dad, being broke, bought the cheapest one, a plan skull with coyote teeth subbed for the flat bovine teeth the skull probably originally came with. I say probably, because the skull spent the next few decades whispering to him, and then to me. Can’t complain much, though, it gave me the advice I needed to get through law school and intimidate any of my opponents in the courtroom.</p>

July 7th, 1878: The Walking Library comes to the Pueblo de Santa Salome. She arrived out of the dust, walking up from a nearby canyon and startling Mateo in his pasture. She carried on her back more than a dozen bound books, a veritable bounty for the time, and offered them to the townspeople in exchange for their secrets. Mateo bought one first, while still in his pasture, and would not stop talking to the others about them. One by one each book was sold, and the Library left. It’s unclear what happened to the others, but the ruins of the labyrinth Mateo purportedly built from the book’s instruction are still visible, and popular with tourists who have tired of kivas and petroglyphs.</p>

People were frequently seen loitering or singing in the parking lot, visibly out of their wits. Jo came to town in a fancy van, purportedly to start a harm reduction program and reach out to those poor souls needing the good word of the lord. He was unusually well received by his new neighbors, who were frequently seen attending parking lot sermons, nodding feverishly to his words. So when their usual songs became a rhythmic chant after three days, we all assumed it was some weird behavior trick Pastor Jo taught to manage withdrawals. We weren’t expecting it to end in a cannibalistic blood orgy on the solstice. It’s probably for the best that Pastor Jo moved on the next day, though it has been nice getting some actual tourists stopping by those parts now that the old inhabitants have all eaten themselves.</p>

<p>Diary of Unknown Conquistador. Entry dated: Saturday, May 25th, the year of our lord 1540. A traveler has entered camp. His clothes are pale blue, frilled and tight fitting. He speaks in quick and harsh English about needing to “get back to the school dance”. Father Gonzalo attends to his burns but I fear he may not live.</p>
<p>The Fine Arts section of the Degoya Clarion newspaper dated November 13th, 1987 contains a gallery review by noted regional art critic Juana Ruyz. Juana is heavy in her praise for the works on display, noting how the abstract pieces evoked powerful and specific memories with every viewing. She is also melancholic about the greater community’s lack of sophistication and the abysmal attendance of the gallery opening, noting herself as the only attendee for this week long exhibition. There is no other known record of the artist “H. Roden And Becker”.</p>

              <p>June 1979: A 1950s-vintage Coca-Cola “slider-chest” vending machine appeared at the side of the Sinclair gas station on Highway 74. The machine was stocked with various sodas, all in 12oz returnable glass bottles, sold for 25¢. Some of the sodas were not normally available in New Mexico, such as Moxie, Grape Nehi, and Ironbeer. Owner Jeb Rodenbecker claimed not to know anything about the machine, who stocked it, or who collected the money or the empty bottles. In October of that year, a local teen purchased a bottle of Ra-Do-Lyte Curative Mineral Water from the machine: a product of the local bottling plant that had been closed for more than 40 years. Thankfully another motorist noticed and knocked the bottle of radium-infused water out of her hand before she could drink it. The mysterious vending machine simply wasn’t there the next day.</p>
