    <title>Monster of the Week: Every Day is Exactly the Same</title>

    <description>Welcome to the sleepy town of Wolf Lake, Ohio. Everyone knows everyone, and every day is much the same. Or exactly the same. It was October 3rd when you rolled into town. It’s always the third.

Monster of the Week is a pbtA game of supernatural investigation. This oneshot is scheduled for 4 hours and will be recorded with players’ permission.

The X-Card is on the table and the Gauntlet Inclusivity policy will be in effect. We’ll also use Lines and Veils.
