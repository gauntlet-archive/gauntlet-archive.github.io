&gt; *Every wednesday of april, on Gauntlet Network!*
&gt;
&gt; *Join the Knightblades, heroes of might and magic, as they embark on their quest to save the Kingdom of Dunador from the evil forces of Duke Kormac and his Black Knights!*
&gt; 
&gt; *The Prince has gone missing, and the King has Vanished. Only the Knightblades can find out what treachery has taken hold of Dunador, and save it from ruin and chaos.*

Storm Riders - Knightblades, takes the storm rider&#39;s framework introduced on Codex: Joy 2 and adapts the base plot of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons module: N3 - Destiny of Kings, to create a tale of whimsy heroic knights fighting evil.
