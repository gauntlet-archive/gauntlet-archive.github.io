    <description>*It&#39;s always raining, here in the city. Or is that just how it feels?*

This is one month run of Urban Shadows Second Edition, using Quickstart 7.0.

No rules knowledge is required. I have not run this game before, so we&#39;ll be learning together.

During the first session we will create characters and sketch out the setting, with the following three sessions devoted to play.

**Signing up for all four sessions is strongly recommended.**  In particular, missing the first session will make integrating your character much more difficult.

Since this is a game of intrigue and politics, there&#39;s a content warning for betrayal. The game also leans on horror tropes, so beware that there may be vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural creatures in the game, including as PCs. The game deals with adult themes, so players under the age of 18 should avoid this one.

Safety tools include Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and the open door policy. The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct will be in effect.

We will meet on Streamyard. The sessions will not be recorded.

A confirmation email will be sent out about a week before the first session. If you don&#39;t respond you may lose your spot, so check your spam folder!
