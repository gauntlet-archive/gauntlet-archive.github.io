# ***NEW BLOOD INITIATIVE!***

**Until November 1st, please ONLY sign up for this one-shot if you&#39;ve joined the Patreon within the last six months OR if you&#39;ve never played in one of my Star Wars Saturdays games**

The Empire is falling to pieces across the galaxy and you all have escaped the Star Destroyer were you were stationed. Somehow, you&#39;ve ended up working on Prospero&#39;s Dream.

*That&#39;s correct, you&#39;re playing ex-Imperials. The Rebellion won. You&#39;re just trying to survive the aftermath.*

For this game, I&#39;m using Ghost Orbit to run the module Mothership: A Pound of Flesh.

GHOST ORBIT is an analog role-playing game about things breaking in space.

You can expect to encounter gross neglect, runaway fires, explosive decompression, labor riots, hostile aliens, and maybe literal ghosts. The players take on the role of IWW Union Spacers trying to survive the day everything went pear-shaped. We play to find out how the spacers survive, and what they lose in the process.

Mothership: A Pound of Flesh is a toolkit for building your own run-down, back-water, black market space station.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

Being able to attend every session is not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. We will be using the X-Card as well as Roses and Thorns after each session.
