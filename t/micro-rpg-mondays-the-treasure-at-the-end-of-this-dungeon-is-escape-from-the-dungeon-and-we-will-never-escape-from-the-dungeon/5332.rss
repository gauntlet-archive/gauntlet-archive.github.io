    <description>The all access time for this session is [date=2020-05-31 time=16:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;].

&gt; We are bone and feathers and we will never escape and we want to escape. We want to fly. The treasure at the end of the dungeon is an escape from this dungeon. We will never escape from this dungeon. We are bones and feathers and hope and magic and we will never escape from this dungeon. We want to fly out of here on our busted wings and feel the air on our faces turned up towards the sun, but each room of the dungeon is the same and each room of the dungeon brings something new and we will never escape from this dungeon.

---

This game is a recursive, self-intersecting, infinite and finite, deadly and immortal, present and ethereal dungeon crawler. All four of us will take roles as explorers of the dungeon (there is no GM role), and we will explore the infinite dungeon one room at a time.

This is a one shot. The game will be run over Zoom, and will be recorded and shared with player permission.

No prior knowledge of the game is required and the rules will be taught at the start of play.

## ﻿Safety Tools

We will be using script change, x-card, lines and veils, and an open door policy. All of these tools will be explained at the start of the session. This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
