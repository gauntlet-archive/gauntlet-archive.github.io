          <p>I present to you the <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/02/02/crowdfunding-collection-132-part-1-of-2/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>new Crowdfunding Collection #132 – Part 1 of 2, including every tabletop rpg project started between 01/26 and 02/02</b></a>.</p>
<p>February introduces the Zine Quest 2 Kickstarter event, which follows a very productive week in regards to projects started. Thus there are a total of 79 projects, about 26 offering new games. To make it a bit more accessible, I decided to split the collection.<br>
<a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/02/02/crowdfunding-collection-132-part-2-of-2-zine-quest/" rel="nofollow noopener">Do take a look at part 2!</a></p>
<p>I will start by focusing on the „normal“ projects.<br>
<b>Cowebs</b> will be a game by Exalted Funerals, which offers a Neo Noir experience. Basically a game in the wake of FFO Limetown, Mind Mgmt and The X-Files. There are cases with a twist, which needed to be explored and revealed. It’s a gm-less game, that utilizes a fascinating looking „map“ and is played with 4d6 and 1d12. I recommend having a look. After ending its Kickstarter successfully <b>Hexagon</b> continues it with a IndieGoGo campaign. I would take a look, though flexible funding and to many other projects are keeping me away.<br>
One of the many other cool projects is <b>The Elephant &amp; Macaw Banner Role-Playing Game</b>. Based on the novel by the same name it offers a uniquely Brazilian setting. I like the description, illustrations and am very tempted to back it. Especially with Tom McGreney having proven to be a reliable creator. <b>Red Rook Revolt!</b> is another fantasy game that caught my eye. The players assume the role of revolutionaries fighting against an imperial power. I am quite fascinated that the game addresses aspects like different views on families and on the working of the comunes. The system is mostly a bespoke one. Another cool project, well and a patreon, is <b>The Chronicles of Ember</b>. Which aims to essentially provide a Dark Souls experience. Like, not so much the mechanics, but the setting. The system it self apparently offers like 4 classes and a lot of skills. Just take a look.  If you want your fantasy more classical, take a look at <b>Swords and Wizardry</b>. Which is like super classic fantasy with an OSR like system. Mostly offering a ultimate collectors edition. Grab it if you like it. I do consider <b>Pride of Giants</b> quite cool, with the giant bee-monster an all. System-wise it’s d20 with tons of skills. Offering a delicious crunchy meal. Last but not least you’ll find the <b>Venture &amp; Dungeon</b> fantasy games. Yeah, games. Two at once. With a PbtA-like system. Focused on belonging. Which is quite interesting.<br>
You might be looking for a more universal system. <b>Era d10 Fundamentals</b> is a hack for the Era games and offers you the opportunity to build your own with the system. Just take a look. Another universal game is <b>GMD Core RPG</b>, which looks nice.<br>
There are two games combining various game styles. <b>Blastback: Sci-Fi Superhero Escape Horror RPS</b> combines Escape games and tabletop rpg for an Urban Fantasy game. Then there’s. <b>Band Battle Royale</b>, which mixes up role-playing with card games to make the players band famous.<br>
Considering there’s <b>Choose Cthulhu 2</b>, <b>All for Anvil</b> and <b>Alice’s Nightmare in Wonderland</b> you might basically roll around in game books. Where I like to give a shoutout towards Alice’s Nightmare in Wonderland, as I enjoyed the original project.<br>
There are a lot of cool projects, like the <b>Dice for All</b> – even as they are imho to pricey -, the transparent dice, stuff like the <b>Simple Spell Tracker</b> and many projects more.<br>
Just take a look:</p>
<p><b>English Crowdfundings</b></p>

6 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br>
2 Universelle Role-Playing Games<br>
2 Hybrid Role-Playing Games<br>
