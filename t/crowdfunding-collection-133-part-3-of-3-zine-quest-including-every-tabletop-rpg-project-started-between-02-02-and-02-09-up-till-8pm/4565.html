<p>The collection is a bit delayed, because I am currently dealing with some personal stuff and because of the massive amount of projects – that’s 44 full games! Next to that, to make it a bit digestible, I split the collection into three parts:<br>
<a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/02/11/crowdfunding-collection-133-part-1-of-3/" rel="nofollow noopener">Crowdfunding Collection #133 – Part 1 of 3</a><br>

<p><b>Orchidelirium</b> has the players set their characters in Victorian times and follow the behest of a shady employer to retrieve special, rare orchids, I do consider the setting,… excentric and the card mechanics interesting. Take a look. If you rather kick all those stiff aristocrats of the victorian age in their bourgoise backs, check out <b>Casette Tape Riot Vol. 0</b>. It places the characters in some alternate 90s, suggest to make a cool punk casette tape (well Spotify thing) and release your inner punk. Which <b>Vanquisher</b> might argue may not work out and focusses on heroes and their (tragic) fates. While it claims it can be played without pen and paper, I think both can help to remember stuff while using the 2d6 system. Fate hasn’t been nice to the characters of <b>Twisted Rifters</b>, as they are arcanely-deformed outsider, who have to try to save their home – a flying island – from its decay. The system is quite interesting as it uses elements of Blades in the Dark. Now, if you like it a bit less heavy, check out <b>You are in a tavern</b>. It is a gm-less game, where you meet and play in a tavern. It’s available in English and French.<br>
Though you might be fan of apocalyptic settings. If you like AKIRA, you have to check out <b>KISHU</b>. You play as members of a juvenile bike gang, that has to navigate a climate apocalypse. The setting is cool, I like the anime, the system is Blades inspired. I am in! You might prefer your apocalypse more realistic (than climate?), well there is <b>Sagas of the Sea Peoples</b>. Which is based on the actual collapse in the bronze age and focuses on the titular „sea people“ – who are one of the rare hints on what might have went down. I think its very, very cool. You can checkout the system at DTRPG. Just take a look! Then there’s <b>Mage Against the Machine</b>, which is way more fantastical. You are a bunch of time travelling mages going back in time to fight the robo-apocalypse. It sounds like fun, and the gm-less system promises quite some freedom. <b>FIGHT PLANET!</b> has a way less complex setting. You are on a trash planet, and you gotta fight to survive. You might be part of a Battle Royal livecast, but that’s it. Sounds okay. Though I feel like I don’t share the creators view on Anarchism. ^^;<br>
Let’s move onto the genre of heist games. <b>The Great Soul Train Robbery</b> offers a description of the game in its title. There is a train, headed to hell, with souls, and you gotta rob it. System wise it builds upon the Honey Heist game and you got like two stats. It does look like a cool, little weird west game that has actually been tested. Check it out. If you like to play more contemporary and varied heists, take a look at <b>Score</b>. The system sounds simple but interesting and I’d say it’s work a look.<br>
If your looking for a fun little party game, maybe Let’s Make A Mary Sue! rocks your boat. The name says it all. You’ll be creating a Mary Sue. With some commentary on the term that I share. The system looks fun (a bit like MAID) and am tempted!<br>
<b>Fruit of Law</b> is a rather contemplative game. While the group eats a pomegrenade, they will try to determine the rules and commandments of a future society. Basically acting as Rabbi with the game being based on a Jewish folk tale. I am fascinated by the game and backed it. Another, in my opinion very emotionally heavy game is the <b>The Wait</b>. It puts the characters in the position of having to wait for the soon and inevitable end of a persons life, with the players creating the life of the dying person. I am fascinated by the project, as well as interested, though the topic is out of my comfort zone. I still recommend checking it out!<br>
You’ll might rather prefer some Science Fiction game. There is <b>Celestial Bodies, Orbital Mechanics</b> on the one hand. You’ll be playing a group having to flee from earth and are on a long way back through the solar system. It will see you explore the characters of, well your characters, and how earth has changed when you return. Then there’s <b>King of Dust</b> which combines a cyberpunk setting with some resource management. <b>THE COMPANY RPG</b> with its focus on „corporate survival horror“ might offer a lighter future setting. At least I couldn’t take it fully serious. Well, and <b>The Good Ol‘ Days</b> game offers monstrous horror fun in the style of 40s to 50s movies. Nice!<br>
Then there are two games for people who like to play animals. <b>Rats with Wings</b> offers Micro-Games about pigeons. stuff added material to spells like „messenger pigeons“ and other stuff about pigeons. Gurruh, Gurruh, Gurruh! Who eats rats? Cats! Which includes <b>Mew-tants!</b> In which you play cats who got superpowers, but still no opposable thumbs. HA!<br>
There are many other cool projects, like the cyberpunk city setting of <b>Beneath the Glass and Steel</b> or the <b>Game Spice</b> zines with mini-games to insert into rpgs. If you need NPCs you might check out <b>PARIAH</b> for outsider characters in OSR games, or check out <b>The Beloved Underbelly</b> for beekeepers, taxidermist or wild hogs. There are zines about deadly plants in a <b>Deadly Garden</b> and a lot about <b>Centipedes!</b><br>
You find these and many more cool projects here:</p>
