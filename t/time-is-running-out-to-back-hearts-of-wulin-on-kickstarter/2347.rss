    <description>There are only 32 hours remaining in the Hearts of Wulin Kickstarter campaign! 

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gauntlet/hearts-of-wulin

Hearts of Wulin is a game of wuxia melodrama, Powered by the Apocalypse. It&#39;s by Agatha Cheng and Lowell Francis, featuring illustrations by Minerva Fox. It&#39;s also the first standalone game to be published by The Gauntlet. 

This project is extremely important to our community. The game was developed in our spaces and we&#39;re hoping, if the Kickstarter is successful enough, it can serve as the springboard for a new publishing model, one that is less predatory than what the TTRPG industry has traditionally seen. 

Please take a look at our campaign and consider backing it. We still have 2 stretch goals to unlock in the final hours. Thanks!
