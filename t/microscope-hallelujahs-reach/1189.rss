    <description>This session is scheduled for 3 hours. The session will be streamed on YouTube and recorded for Gauntlet Hangouts.
This is a one-shot of [Microscope](http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/), using which we&#39;ll create a science fantasy setting for some following sessions of Never Tell Me the Odds. Being able to attend each session is not required.

*(please read with your best Texan accent)*
Welcome to Hallelujah&#39;s Reach: the finest galaxy and the last stop this side of the furthest group in the cluster. Some call it a haven for a certain criminal element, but me? I like to think of it as an untapped gold mine - and yes, I know, gold&#39;s not worth much these days, but stick with the metaphor. Ol&#39; Hallelujah&#39;s got it all: runners kicking on that hyperdrive faster than you can blink; enormous cruise liners floating through dust for days at a time; stratospheric romance, 50,000 feet in the air; the finest gray markets found in the carved out core of a planet long dead; psychic duels happening thousands of megameter across (and believe you me, you do NOT want to be in the middle of that!); ...
So swing on by, stay for awhile and...try to stay out of trouble.

We will use the [X-card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit#!) and [Script Change](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change) during our sessions. We will observe the [Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
