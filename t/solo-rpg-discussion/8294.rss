    <description>*Do you have a stack of unplayed solo RPGs?*

*Do you want to show off the cool maps, journals, and other game artefacts you create while playing?*

*Or do you just want to hang out and chat about solo games for an hour?*

This is a series of four weekly meetups for solo RPG players where we talk about our recent solo gaming experiences. If there is enough interest, more sessions may be added.

You can sign up for every session or just a single one. Each session is one hour long and starts at 9 pm GMT.

If a session is coming up and you haven&#39;t played anything recently, try to find a few minutes to do so. Part of the reason I&#39;m setting this up is to push myself to play more solo games, and I hope it will do the same for you.

That said, if you haven&#39;t played anything, please don&#39;t let that keep you from showing up!

The open access time for this series will be 48 hours after this post. Sessions will not be recorded. We will meet on Streamyard.

A reminder will be sent out a few days ahead of each session. Check your spam folder! If you don&#39;t answer, someone from the waiting list may be offered your spot.
