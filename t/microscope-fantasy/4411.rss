    <description>I will be running a session of Microscope this month for folks interested in building a fantasy world and exploring its history.

&quot;In Microscope, you build an epic history as you play. Want to play a game that spans the entire Dune series, the Silmarillion, or the rise and fall of Rome in an afternoon? That’s Microscope.&quot;

The X-Card and Lines and Veils will be in used for safety tools as well as the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.

We will use Streamyard to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.
