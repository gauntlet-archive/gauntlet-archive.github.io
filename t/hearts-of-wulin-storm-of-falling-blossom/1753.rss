    <description>Forgot to put up my initial sessions on here, but I have a space in the final two sessions of the series of Hearts of Wulin I&#39;m running this month, details below. Please note, this game is open for general signups as it was originally posted a while back!

Hearts of Wulin is a Powered by the Apocalypse game about playing martial artists in a fantastical take on China, inspired by wuxia media such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or the films of the Shaw Brothers. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged, but not required. Each session must be signed up for individually. The sessions are scheduled for three hours. They will be recorded, and uploaded to YouTube with the consent of all participants.

As spring rejuvenates the land, the passions of warriors in the wulin also begin to stir. We will explore new loves, old rivalries, and a host of stories in between. As our heroes are driven by their passions, they must also deal with their duties to lord and family. And all this melodrama will be suit against a background of high-flying action and villainous plots.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.

[Session 3](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LYNhMlTtWKnNq2i22CS)  [date=2019-04-19 time=20:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot; format=&quot;LLLL&quot;]
[Session 4](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LYNhW_-56BVlILom_BN) [date=2019-04-26 time=20:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot; format=&quot;LLLL&quot;]</description>
