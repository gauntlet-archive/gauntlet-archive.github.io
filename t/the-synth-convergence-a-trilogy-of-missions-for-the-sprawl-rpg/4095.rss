*Welcome to The Synth Convergence, a trilogy of missions for The Sprawl RPG built around a core theme - synthetic intelligence. Across the three mission teams will cross paths with prominent synths and be forced to confront the question of how far they will go for their Corporate paycheck in a society where inequality is rife and Corporations control every rung of the ladder. *

*In The Tannhauser Investment (available as a free demo) the team are brought in to negotiate the tricky process of a hostile Corporate takeover - all while evading the awareness of the synth consciousness built into the super-luxury hotel the target is holed up in.*

*The Infinitive Extraction takes the team to the beating heart of the entertainment districts as they seek to extract Infinitive Cascade, the hottest DJ on the circuits from an exploitative contract. But do your employers want them for their musical talents or the military codebase at the core of their personality matrix?*

*Finally in The Vanda-Weiss Demolition the past catches up with the team as they face off against The Evolved, an extremist fringe group dedicated to wiping out synths and returning humanity to the true path before they are toppled by their own creations.*

*Get in, do the job, get out. It&#39;s never that simple but if it was they wouldn&#39;t have hired professionals like you.*

After the initial demo release of The Tannhauser Investment at the start of November this weekend I launched The Synth Convergence, a new trilogy of missions for The Sprawl RPG built around the theme of synthetic life. It&#39;s available for download from drivethruRPG and itch and thanks to early purchasers there are now a small number of community copies available for the wider community.

You can purchase The Synth Convergence from [itch.io](https://lunarshadow.itch.io/synth-convergence) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/292542/The-Synth-Convergence?affiliate_id=174853)</description>
