    <description>@Coalhada and I are getting ready to record our 50th episode of Fear of a Black Dragon. It&#39;s going to be a special episode where we reflect on the OSR scene and the show itself, as well as answer your questions. If you have a question you&#39;d like us to answer, please put it in the replies. The question can be about ANYTHING: OSR modules, TTRPGs more generally, fun facts about the hosts, whatever.

              <p>One of the reasons I love the podcast is because it’s so philosophical at times, so I wonder perhaps whether you’d answer a question along the lines of ‘What aspects of thinking deeply about game design have transferred over to other parts of your lives?’, or something along those lines. If you don’t see ‘parts’ of your life as separable, then that would also be an interesting answer.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/coalhada">@Coalhada</a> and I are getting ready to record our 50th episode of Fear of a Black Dragon. It’s going to be a special episode where we reflect on the OSR scene and the show itself, as well as answer your questions. If you have a question you’d like us to answer, please put it in the replies. The question can be about ANYTHING: OSR modules, TTRPGs more generally, fun facts about the hosts, whatever.</p>
