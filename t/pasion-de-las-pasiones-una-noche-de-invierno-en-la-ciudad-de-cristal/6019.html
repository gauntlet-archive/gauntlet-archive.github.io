<p><strong>FOR THE FIRST 72 HOURS, PLEASE DO NOT SIGN UP IF YOU HAVE PLAYED IN A GAME I’VE RUN THIS YEAR</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NUMBER OF SESSIONS:</strong>  4 sessions total, being able to attend each session is strongly requested, you must RSVP to each session.<br>
<strong>DURATION:</strong>  3 hours<br>
<strong>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:</strong>  2, seats are being reserved for Kyle and Marleigh<br>
<strong>CONTENT WARNING:</strong>  This game will include danger and peril to children, supernatural themes. While violence between players is possible, it is unlikely to go beyond pushing and perhaps a punch or two. Themes of adolescence and maturity may come up, along with other aspects of identity that children are aware of or struggle with.</p>
<p><strong>-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>There are legends, in Ciudad Soñando, that every so often, the onset of winter is just a bit stranger than normal. Great-grandmothers pass down stories of the winter they remember, but they also heard stories from their great-grandmothers of a similarly curious season, and they passed down tales from their great-grandmothers and if there were winters like that before them … well, who can say? Ciudad Soñando has a written history dating back almost 300 years but none of those records document anything that odd, so the tales were always dismissed as flights of fancy spun by old women entertaining children with fables about their own childhood. Your great-grandmothers described going outside to play and explore this startling new world, only to discover reality can be far more unusual … and dangerous … than anyone had ever told them.</p>
<p>But those were just stories that old women told children to keep them occupied and out of trouble, right? Surely those stories have nothing to do with the roiling storm clouds racing in from the Pacific. And today, as the sky darkens, for the first time you can remember, your great-grandmothers aren’t telling you the stories. Today, their eyes twinkle with mischief as they simply say, “Patience, children. You’ll find out for yourselves soon enough.”</p>
<p>Players will assume the role of children from the ages of about 9 to 13 in Ciudad Soñando (if players have a different idea, we can discuss it). You are all friends, even if friendship occasionally means arguing and fighting with each other to resolve conflicts, and sometimes you have to apologize after yelling something especially unkind because you wanted your friend to hurt as badly as they made you feel. And this year, you’ll all encounter something that doesn’t seem possible - an actual winter storm with snow and ice at sea level in Baja California - and you’ll explore the storm’s mysteries together because this is irresistibly odd, especially for children with great-grandmothers who seem to still hold one last secret.</p>
<p>Touchstones include authors like Italo Calvino, Madeleine L’Engle, Umberto Eco, Gabriel García Márquez, Mark Helprin, and Jorge Luis Borges, and media like “The NeverEnding Story,” “Labyrinth,” “Goonies,” “The Princess Bride,” “The Dark Crystal,” “Fables,” “Stranger Things,” “Sandman,” “Pushing Daisies,” and “The Unwritten.”</p>
<p><strong>-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAFETY TOOLS IN USE:</strong>  This session will use a lengthy list of Lines and Veils to facilitate an initial baseline for player safety. Players are absolutely encouraged to add more topics to the list for their own safety. This session will also use the N-Card, X-Card, and Script Change as necessary to adjust the game while it’s in progress to maintain player safety. Finally, the Open Door Policy is always in effect and players may leave the game at any time for any length of time for any reason. This session will also adhere to The Gauntlet’s Community Code of Conduct: <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html</a><br>
<strong>RSVP OPEN ACCESS TIME:</strong>  11/04/2020, 23:00 Central Time<br>
<strong>SET UP INFO:</strong>  We will use Streamyard for the event. Players should expect a reminder email approximately one week before the series starts.<br>
<strong>BREAKS:</strong>  2 five minute breaks<br>
<strong>RECORDED:</strong>  If all participants consent, it will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube (eventually; everyone knows I’m slow with that stuff).<br>
<strong>PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED:</strong>  No experience required, rules will be taught.</p>
