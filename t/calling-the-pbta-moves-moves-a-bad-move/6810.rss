    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/calling-the-pbta-moves-moves-a-bad-move/6810</link>
    <description>A lot has been said about how Vincent&#39;s prose in Apocalypse World is colourful and evocative.  Still, at least for me and those in my social circle (as well as for a significant number of people online, see basically any &quot;New GM&quot; threads in the PbtA reddit), trying to wrestle how to actually play the game from the text was quite challenging.

Apart from my own intellectual limitations, I think a major reason for this is the somewhat misguided introduction of fancy new terminology. +1 Forward/Ongoing aside, I feel the game term I had the most problem with is *move*. Years later, I now see that there is good reason to be confused here:

First of all, the word is used to reference two mechanisms, namely player moves and GM moves, which are fundamentally irreconcilable:

1. **Not everything a player does is a move.** Many games state this explicitly, usually in the context of combat: *&quot;If the enemy isn’t prepared for your attack [...] then that’s not hack and slash&quot;* (DW).

2. **Everything the GM does, however, *is* a move.** This is RAW.

To make matters worse, there&#39;s a third problem that hits hardest the people that are not acquainted with rpgs at all:

3. **Both concepts resemble, but are ultimately very different from, the canonical notion of a move in a traditional game.** In any &quot;traditional&quot; game (chess, checkers, boardgames, whatever), a move is one of a very specific set of actions a player can take when their turn comes up. This, I think, is partially responsible for the very common misconception that moves  in PbtA games are a set of prescriptive actions the player can take at any given moment.

I feel as if this was meant to reproduce the *feel* of a move in chess, the back-and-forth motion of player makes a move, GM makes a move in response, player makes another move and so on. 

Still, taking all of the above into consideration, I think this is far from ideal communication, which leads me to the points I&#39;d like to discuss with all you PbtA designers out there: 

* **Why have most of the PbtA games that came out afterwards reproduced this terminology? Am I missing something?** 

and

* **How could we iterate on these terms and concepts to make our own designs better?** 

(Fellowship comes to mind as a game that changed this, framing GM moves as &quot;Reactions&quot; and &quot;Cuts&quot;, which I think is much clearer).

Anyway, new to the forums and would love to hear your opinions on this.</description>

<p>I think this is maybe getting at the core of it, and it honestly hadn’t struck me like this before. “Moves” aren’t just rules in the game, they’re specifically things that characters in the fiction do, and deserve to be called out by a different name. For the most part—things like end of session moves and whatnot flout that definition, but I feel like it hits solidly enough to fit.</p>

<p>I have to push back on the “moves” term. What Ironsworn defines as a “move” sounds like a description of what a rule or a ruleset is. Gameplay rules in OSR aren’t called moves, but I think you could describe them as “self-contained systems to resolve a specific action, scene or question.” So, while it’s good that Ironsworn defines its terminology, is this actually helpful for greater PbtA vocabulary? Of course, Ironsworn isn’t responsible for that, but I think this is still a great example to explore in contrast to other PbtA games, especially the ones that assume knowledge (like, for example, “take harm as established”).</p>

<p>That is interesting, and not something I’ve given a ton of thought. Calling moves a “rule” might be accurate, but it muddies the water because there are “rules” that sit above moves. There’s a mechanic for doing a thing called burning momentum, for example, that isn’t presented  as a move. Honestly it should be presented as a move based on what I do with everything else, but it’s just not, darn it.</p>
<p>For PbtA games that operate at a zoomed-out scale calling them something like a “scene” would be interesting. For Ironsworn though, it comes down to … I don’t know. “Situation”? “Action”? That is just leading me back to synonyms for move.</p>
<p>In the end, people seem to grok “move” just fine, even folk new to PbtA. So, it’s a legacy term that seems to work okay. And I like that it’s an explicit nod to the wellspring of PbtA.</p>
<p>Ironsworn otherwise has a bunch of its own vocabulary, for better or worse.</p>

              <p>I’m a big fan of capitalization when it’s Important. I had to double-check, as I only own a couple PbtA systems, and, yeah, moves is lower case. I think simply capitalizing Moves would help distinguish it from simply moves, making it its Own Thing.</p>
<p>That said, I often use the word “trigger” to signal when a Move should happen, so it’s clear when the fiction pauses and the rolls begin. I encourage my players to use it too, so they can claim to trigger a particular Move.</p>
<p>I wanted to use a similar concept in my Battlestreets game, but as I was using a side-scroller video game for inspiration, it was easy to use the word “tap” for the process. Trigger, tap, tag… all would be more helpful IMO</p>
<p>Or to keep the idea of a narrative, something like Spotlight or Focus. But that’s a bit GM-facing, as the GM might say “OK, let’s Spotlight  that. You are ‘Acting Under Pressure.’ Roll +Cool.”</p>

<p>There’s something about the assumption that “conversation also runs on cause-and-effect logic…” I’m not sure what my position is on it, but I’m thinking about earlier discussions about players triggering moves and everything a GM says being a “move.” If a player doesn’t trigger a move, is that a conversational failure? Is the GM allowed to step out of the move-making, conversational responsibility?</p>

<p>I had to read and play a few before I felt like I got it.</p>
<p>I’ll call out <em>Masks</em> for bucking this trend. For example, by clarifying that moves trigger other moves (eg. a failed <strong>Directly Engage a Threat</strong> roll can trigger <strong>Take a Powerful Blow</strong> – or the GM can just tell someone <strong>Take a Powerful Blow</strong> out of nowhere if it’s established in the fiction that they get surprised). Or that when you ask a character, “How can I make you do <em>X</em>?”, the answer can be, “<em>You can’t.</em>”</p>
<p>As for the original question, <em>roll triggers</em> may have been a better term. I tell people who haven’t played a PbtA game before, “Just narrate until I tell you to roll.”</p>

<p>do those moves actually <em>replace</em> a GM during solo or co-op?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Interestingly enough, the <em>Ironsworn</em> book seems to frame it a different way. Glancing through the section on fate moves, it almost always discusses solo/co-op first, then “guided play” (with a GM). The book dodges the question of which mode is the “default” mode. The book also states that while the GM can reference the fate moves (and if I GM’d this system, I would keep them in hand), that the GM “represents the whims of fate” and is “the oracle” in guided play.</p>
<p>So the short answer is: “replace” is a large word, but fate moves can play the same role as the GM. And in PbtA, the GM disclaims a lot of decision-making anyways, so it’s a blurred line.</p>

</aside>
<p>The book does say that the GM can use and reference the fate moves. However, I’m not sure what you mean by confusing the GM’s position. As with any PbtA game, <em>Ironsworn</em> has its principles for how the GM should arbitrate play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does this game even make sense with “moves” or is it just using the established vocabulary being PbtA?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Disclaimer: I seem to be one of those gamers who aren’t perplexed by the “moves” terminology. With that in mind, let’s refer to how <em>Ironsworn</em> defines moves:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Moves are self-contained systems to resolve a specific action, scene or question. There is a move for most common situations you encounter in Ironsworn. They have specific triggers, phrased as “When you [blank].” When your character does that thing, or you encounter that situation, refer to the move to see what happens.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m on board with this definition. Moves as a self-contained system that resolves something. They have triggers; they have procedures such as simple if-then rules, dice rolls, or human choices; and they have effects. This works well with the conversation because the conversation also runs on cause-and-effect logic.</p>
<p>So while <em>Ironsworn</em> is using “moves” in the PbtA sense, I do grasp how <em>Ironsworn</em> is using the thing that it calls “moves.”</p>
<p>(God, this got longer than I thought.)</p>

              <p>Great post! On a sidenote, Baker stated somewhere that forgetting to use a move does not cause a failure state in AW, you just instinctively ‘fall back’ to a more simple layer by design and resolve the situation there: Something like this:</p>
<p>Peripheral &amp; playbook moves<br>
Basic moves<br>
Conversation</p>
<p>So if you play by the agendas and principles but do not use a single move for hours, you still play AW RAW, just on a more simple level.</p>

<p>Ahem</p>
<p>Although <em>I do</em> like that interpretation very much and think it implies all kinds of crazy design possibilities, I do not feel as if that’s what the authors were going for. It’s been some time since I read AW, so I’m not entirely sure of the OG standpoint, but Adam Koebel definitely has another perspective in Dungeon World, which is what I’m most familiar with (I know, I know).</p>
<p>First, because there’s a huge amount of things that players do that move the plot forward and do not count as moves, such as murdering someone in their sleep (although I suppose that could count as a GM Move anyway?). There’s also the way that monster moves work, which as written are basically moves in the chess sense.</p>
<p>To me, it seems, it would make more sense to call the options that a move entails “moves”, and to call the actual moves “procedures” or something (which, I recognize, sounds at lot less exciting and fluid).</p>
