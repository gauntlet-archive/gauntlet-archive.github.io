              <p>My favorites are definitely the Dia De Los Muertos ones in Codex: Blood 2. Assuming you play all three they end up leading to lovely amounts of callbacks and meta stuff.</p>
<p>The other really fun one is one <a class="mention" href="/u/jasoncordova">@jasoncordova</a> came up with meant to do an 80â€™s action flick where an appellate court judge takes matters into his own hands to take down a drug kingpin. It has a special requirement that anytime the judge kills bad guys they have to say a Court/Law/etc. one liner or pun.</p>
<p>Re: first time players - yes it is great for them with the caveat that there is a chunk of creativity necessary and people can feel a touch on the spot, but assuming you have enough people playing (and it can handle up to like 6 or 7) people without ideas can just pass.</p>
<p>Oh - one other thing: we at the Gauntlet generally run with a slightly special rule - the rolling player - they roll in secret - they then continue the story - but nobody knows if they failed or succeeded the roll until they do their narration. Keeps up the suspense.</p>
