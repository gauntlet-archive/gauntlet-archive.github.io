    <title>Bump In The Dark: Iron Country Christmas (Five sessions in December)</title>

    <description>**For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you haven&#39;t played in a game I&#39;ve run this year. One spot is saved for Jex Thomas.**

It&#39;s December 1994 on the Ontonagon Peninsula, a belt of mining towns barely clinging to life. These towns are surrounded on all sides by the Sylvan Wilds, a forest known for old-growth pines and strange happenings. The whole peninsula seems to be teeming with the supernatural, a fact those in power would like to conceal. But you are a monster hunter, and you’ve promised to keep regular people safe from the horrors in the darkness.

*Bump in the Dark*  is a Forged in the Dark game about community, chosen family and beating the shit out of monsters by Jex Thomas. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter for this game includes usual horror warnings for violence and gore. The game also includes a focus on class struggle and economic inequality. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

Attendance at all sessions is encouraged but not required. Please sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend.

I’ve scheduled this for five weekends in December but I recognise that people will likely have seasonal commitments, possibly including me. It may turn out we need to cancel one or more of the last sessions. If that happens, we can talk as a group about whether to stick with a short series or try to schedule more sessions in the new year.

Sessions will run on Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. If players consent, I’ll record the sessions for my own use (as a terrible note-taker), but will only post them publicly if everyone is into that. 

I’ll email players a week before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials. 

Open access time for sign ups is 3pm 3rd November AEDT.
