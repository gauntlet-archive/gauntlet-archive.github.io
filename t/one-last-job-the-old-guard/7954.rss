    <description>*It is a story about time, and age, and ages,*
*and about friendship, and love, and regret.*

*They are soldiers, and their war never ends.*
*They&#39;ve been everywhere, seen everything,*
*and fought in virtually every conflict through the present day.*

*For centuries, they have kept their existence hidden,*
*never staying in one place too long always moving*
*from mission to mission.*

*But today, the shadows aren&#39;t so dark,*
*and they are about to learn that secrets*
*are impossible to keep.*

*And you absolutely do not want to get in their way*
*when those secrets are laid bare...*

This is a one-shot session of [One Last Job](https://gshowitt.itch.io/one-last-job) by Grant Howitt where players will portray immortal warriors getting together for one last mission. Our setting is based on the comic &amp; movie  *The Old Guard*  by Greg Rucka. There will be intense combat, drama, and history. It is important to note that character creation and development in One Last Job are collaborative. You do not have full control over the character you will play.

I will send a reminder 1 week before the session. Passing grades in History class not required, nor is prior knowledge of the original property. Rules will be taught.

**CW: Post-traumatic stress, battle/war,**
**System**  : One Last Job
**Duration**  : 4 Hours (might go short? This is my first time with the system.)
**Breaks**  : 5-10 minutes approximately on the hour
**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom
**Recording**  : No

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).</description>
