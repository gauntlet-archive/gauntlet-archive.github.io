    <description>Hey all!  It dawns on me that I never shared this here.  

There was a little conversation on the Dungeon World Discord, discussing what it might look like to have a Dungeon-World like game with no stats, and where most of the basic moves were only available to specific classes. I was apparently in need of a distraction from my bigger projects, and whipped this guy together.  

https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2020/02/defying-danger-rpg.html 

I haven&#39;t had a chance to actually play it yet myself, but there&#39;s a couple people who have. It&#39;s even been [translated into Italian](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2020/03/sfidando-il-pericolo.html)!

One bit of feedback I&#39;ve gotten is that the game feels &quot;harder&quot; than standard DW or WoD, because you&#39;re often rolling a straight 2d6+0.  The intent is that players should largely try to avoid a straight 2d6 roll whenever they could, by positioning themselves to use their better move and/or their &quot;good&quot; Defy Danger areas.  I&#39;m curious how others perceive the difficulty level.  

Thoughts and feedback appreciated, of course!

<p>Here's a thing I made, as a bit of a distraction from working on Stonetop . It's a light-weight RPG, in the vein of World of Dungeons .     ...</p>
