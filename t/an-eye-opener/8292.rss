    <description>Hi, Ezra Rose&#39;s zine on cultural appropriation of the Kabbalah was a (third ;) ) eye opener for me:
https://ezrarose.itch.io/fyma-a-lesser-key
I like messing with myths and stuff, and it sometimes makes me miss what it can also mean for other people. Believers, alright, that&#39;s one thing ; but also white supremacists, and that&#39;s a whole different thing. Maybe it&#39;s totally clear in your cultural background, it certainly wasn&#39;t in mine.
So if you want to know more, I strongly suggest you read the zine and maybe drop a token of appreciation in the authrix&#39;s* hat.
