              <p>How would you “create” Dungeon World (or any PBTA/Trad Game stepping stone) using the lessons we’ve learned in the last 5 years, and how can we help introduce new players to a wider range of gaming without being dismissive of trad games?</p>
<p>What are the most important safety tools/discussions to have at the table?</p>
<p>What has been the most positive and most negative shift in gaming you’ve seen in the last decade?</p>
