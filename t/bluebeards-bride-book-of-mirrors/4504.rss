This isn’t the fairy tale you know…

**Bluebeard&#39;s Bride**  is an investigatory horror tabletop roleplaying game that creates stories of feminine horror in the vein of Crimson Peak, American Horror Story, and The Company of Wolves.  **The Book of Mirrors** sends players into new versions of Bluebeard&#39;s Bride, scattered throughout history and horror. 

Each of these five sessions will take on a different version of the tale. Dive into the minds of Bluebeard&#39;s son, a boarding school governess, a patient in a condemned asylum, a showgirl new to a dark carnival, or the first female guard at Granville Correctional Facility.

Each session is a standalone one-shot. You must RSVP to each session you want to play in. Sessions run 3 to 3.5 hours with optional debrief afterward. Sessions will take place via Jitsi and will be recorded for later posting.

Rules will be taught. Bluebeard’s Bride is rated “Adults Only” and deals with mature subject matter; the game is made to go into dark and sensitive directions in terms of its subject matter. The tone of the game will be a hard R. At start of session, we will review the tone we are aiming for. We will establish lines &amp; veils, and go over our safety tools each session. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in effect and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.

I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. If you sign up and your ability to attend changes, please also send me a message via slack or email. 

*SESSIONS*

**Bluebeard&#39;s Legacy**
The Bluebeard&#39;s Legacy play-set is an opportunity to explore the estate of your late father, Bluebeard. How will the Son interpret the rooms of his father&#39;s house? Will he reject the tales his mother spun, claim his birthright, and remake the estate in his own image? Or will he reject his father&#39;s legacy, leaving the mansion to rot? Or perhaps—as noble as the Son&#39;s intentions may be—will he succumb to madness?

**Boarding School**
The Boarding School play-set is an opportunity to explore a 19th century English boy&#39;s boarding school. How will the Teacher submit to the demands of her superiors? Will she accept the Headmaster&#39;s generous offer of marriage? Or will she refuse his kindness, falling prey to the corrupting desire for independence? Or perhaps—as much as she loves her work—will she find herself cracking under the pressure?

**Condemned Asylum**
The Condemned Asylum play-set is an opportunity to explore a women&#39;s insane asylum during the 1910s. How will the Patient cope with her institutionalization? Will she accept Doctor Bluebeard&#39;s diagnosis and undergo his experimental procedures? Or will she reject his expertise and undermine his authority? Or perhaps—as sane as she may feel herself to be—will she grow to crave the comforts of the asylum?

--
**Dark Carnival**
The Dark Carnival play-set is a an opportunity to explore a traveling show of dark wonders in the 1950s. How will the Showgirl regard the sensual shows and fascinating freaks? Will she find a place for herself here as the leading act in Bluebeard&#39;s show? Or will she find herself unable to fit in among the freaks and carnies of the carnival? Or perhaps—despite her obvious normalcy—is she finally at home among the monsters?

--
**Correctional Facility**
The Correctional Facility play-set is an opportunity to explore a women&#39;s prison as a guard during the 1980s. How will the Guard perform as the first woman officer of the prison? Will she join the Warden&#39;s trusted staff? Or will she resist his offers and expose the corruption in his inner circle? Or perhaps—despite her steadfast nature—will she find herself craving the violence and degradation required to keep order in Granville?
