<p>This isn‚Äôt the fairy tale you know‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Bluebeard‚Äôs Bride</strong>  is an investigatory horror tabletop roleplaying game that creates stories of feminine horror in the vein of Crimson Peak, American Horror Story, and The Company of Wolves.  <strong>The Book of Mirrors</strong> sends players into new versions of Bluebeard‚Äôs Bride, scattered throughout history and horror.</p>
<p>Each of these five sessions will take on a different version of the tale. Dive into the minds of Bluebeard‚Äôs son, a boarding school governess, a patient in a condemned asylum, a showgirl new to a dark carnival, or the first female guard at Granville Correctional Facility.</p>
<p>Each session is a standalone one-shot. You must RSVP to each session you want to play in. Sessions run 3 to 3.5 hours with optional debrief afterward. Sessions will take place via Jitsi and will be recorded for later posting.</p>
<p>Rules will be taught. Bluebeard‚Äôs Bride is rated ‚ÄúAdults Only‚Äù and deals with mature subject matter; the game is made to go into dark and sensitive directions in terms of its subject matter. The tone of the game will be a hard R. At start of session, we will review the tone we are aiming for. We will establish lines &amp; veils, and go over our safety tools each session. <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">The Gauntlet Code of Conduct</a> will be in effect and safety tools (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m" rel="nofollow noopener">Script Change</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg" rel="nofollow noopener">X-Card</a>) will be in use.</p>
<p>I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. If you sign up and your ability to attend changes, please also send me a message via slack or email.</p>
<p><em>SESSIONS</em></p>
<p><strong>Bluebeard‚Äôs Legacy</strong><br>
The Bluebeard‚Äôs Legacy play-set is an opportunity to explore the estate of your late father, Bluebeard. How will the Son interpret the rooms of his father‚Äôs house? Will he reject the tales his mother spun, claim his birthright, and remake the estate in his own image? Or will he reject his father‚Äôs legacy, leaving the mansion to rot? Or perhaps‚Äîas noble as the Son‚Äôs intentions may be‚Äîwill he succumb to madness?</p>

<p>‚Äì<br>
<strong>Boarding School</strong><br>
The Boarding School play-set is an opportunity to explore a 19th century English boy‚Äôs boarding school. How will the Teacher submit to the demands of her superiors? Will she accept the Headmaster‚Äôs generous offer of marriage? Or will she refuse his kindness, falling prey to the corrupting desire for independence? Or perhaps‚Äîas much as she loves her work‚Äîwill she find herself cracking under the pressure?</p>

<p>‚Äì<br>
<strong>Condemned Asylum</strong><br>
The Condemned Asylum play-set is an opportunity to explore a women‚Äôs insane asylum during the 1910s. How will the Patient cope with her institutionalization? Will she accept Doctor Bluebeard‚Äôs diagnosis and undergo his experimental procedures? Or will she reject his expertise and undermine his authority? Or perhaps‚Äîas sane as she may feel herself to be‚Äîwill she grow to crave the comforts of the asylum?</p>

</a></p>
<p>‚Äì<br>
<strong>Dark Carnival</strong><br>
The Dark Carnival play-set is a an opportunity to explore a traveling show of dark wonders in the 1950s. How will the Showgirl regard the sensual shows and fascinating freaks? Will she find a place for herself here as the leading act in Bluebeard‚Äôs show? Or will she find herself unable to fit in among the freaks and carnies of the carnival? Or perhaps‚Äîdespite her obvious normalcy‚Äîis she finally at home among the monsters?</p>

</a></p>
<p>‚Äì<br>
<strong>Correctional Facility</strong><br>
The Correctional Facility play-set is an opportunity to explore a women‚Äôs prison as a guard during the 1980s. How will the Guard perform as the first woman officer of the prison? Will she join the Warden‚Äôs trusted staff? Or will she resist his offers and expose the corruption in his inner circle? Or perhaps‚Äîdespite her steadfast nature‚Äîwill she find herself craving the violence and degradation required to keep order in Granville?</p>
