    <title>Hot Gay Bro Dragons (one shot)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/hot-gay-bro-dragons-one-shot/7838</link>
    <description>This is a game for two players by Taylor LaBresh about hot gay bro dragons who love each other and who love telling each other how much they love each other. No GM, no dice, positive vibes only!  “In theory you could do other things with this game included, but not limited to, sad stories, arguments, or anything that’s a bummer. Please don’t do that.”

Subject matter wise, the game is very queer and obviously you need to be comfortable expressing the love of one hot gay bro dragon for another. 

We’ll be using the x card, lines and veils and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

This is a one-shot and will probably run about an hour; if it goes longer, we’ll take a short break. I’ve put it on the calendar at 10am for me just bc I needed to pick a time but if you sign up and want to play earlier or later the same day, my schedule is flexible and I’m happy to adjust the time. 

The session will run over Zoom and won’t be recorded. I’ll send out an email a week before the first session to confirm attendance. 

Open access time for sign-ups is 4pm 8/2/22 AEDT.
