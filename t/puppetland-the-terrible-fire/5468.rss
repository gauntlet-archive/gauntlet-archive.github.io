    <description>*A storytelling game with strings in a grim world of make-believe*

In one golden hour, you and your friends shall weave a tale none will soon forget: a tale of good-hearted puppets in a bad-hearted world. You shall rise up against the savagery of Punch the Maker-Killer with his army of Nutcrackers and his terrible Boys, sewn from the flesh of the Maker of all puppets. You shall be steadfast and true. You shall likely die trying. One-hour games have never been filled with more humor and horror, courage and cowardice, childlike wonder and childlike terror than the experimental role-playing game Puppetland.

Puppetland is a storytelling game. You play a valiant puppet who speaks aloud every word you say. The game moderator — the Puppetmaster — narrates the unfolding events, speaking in the past tense like the voice of a storybook. You speak for your puppet and the Puppetmaster says the rest. You surprise each other at every turn, collaborating moment by inspired moment to unlock your own creativity and find the puppet within.

**Having some kind of puppet to hand for the game will be very useful and is recommended.**

**The Terrible Fire!**

&quot;come and see the dragon!&quot; cried Monsieur Babypants, the little shadow puppet baby. Nearby puppets on the edge of town were surprised at his news. A dragon? Where?

Monsieur Babypants led the puppets to a nearby grassy meadow where Farmer Rhubarb tended his tidy rows. The haystack was the largest one any puppet had ever seen, and tendrils of smoke drifted from its deep interior...

Monsieur Babypants imminent destruction is only the beginning. This fire is already out of control and if not contained and subdued, all of Puppetland and everyone in it will burn to ash.

We will play over Zoom, and I will record the game, but check in with everyone for consent before publishing. 

**Content Warnings:** 

This game leans on the brutal violence of puppet shows like Punch &amp; Judy. 

**Safety Tools:**

We will have the usual Lines &amp; Veils, and in play we will use Script Change and an Open Door. The community&#39;s [Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in operation.

This is a one-shot game; RSVPs open to all on 24th June at 2pm (GMT).
