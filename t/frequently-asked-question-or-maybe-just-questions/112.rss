    <title>Frequently Asked Question (or maybe just Questions?)</title>

    <description>Hi, I have a question: What does the &quot;Flag&quot; thing do? Does this send a message to mods or admins to flag content that may be critical? Or is this like a bookmark?

Weird. For testing purposes, I decided to flag this post, and learned that yes, it was a message to the mods. 

When trying to send it, I received the message that I had reached the maximum number of new topics a new user can create and that I should wait 42 minutes. Does flagging count as &quot;Creating a topic&quot;?</description>

              <p>Looks to me that both <em>RPG Chat</em> and <em>Game Design</em> would work, with Chat having an edge if you want to focus on running games and sharing experiences (“Chat about actual play of, prepping to play, and running of LARPs and RPGs.”) and GD if you’re mostly interested in discussing design elements (“For the discussion of the design(ing) of LARPs and RPGs.”). I’d go with Chat as it’s broader in scope but IDK what you primarily want to get out of it. At the end of the day mods can always move your topic so I would just start a topic and go from there. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I like the idea, BTW.

              <p>The mods have been having some tangentially related discussions about content so this is timely…</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts:</p>
<p>The first questions to ask yourself before posting on the forums are “what do I hope and envision this discussion to look like? How do I want the other community members to interact with it?”</p>
<p>This isn’t a cork board for people to post their flyers on and move on. So just posting and saying “this is what Nerdly is, here’s the web site, you should come” isn’t what we’d want to see. (Knowing you though I wouldn’t expect that.)</p>
<p>Knowing what I know about Nerdly I think there are a number of great discussions to be had around Nerdly: it’s focus on community, the cycling of the chief owlbear position, the push for supporting gamers with kids, scholarships, how it should be a model for other regional cons, etc. Those are all meaty discussions waiting to happen.</p>
<p>Opening up discussions in those veins in RPG Chat (ideally without boldly putting Nerdly in the topic title) and pointing to Nerdly as an exemplar would be a fantastic wat to both Improve The Discussion here on the forums and highlight Nerdly.</p>

              <p>Okay so there are a couple of things you can do depending on what you want. First off go to your account preferences<br>
First click on your name and click the gear.<br>

Next click depending on what you want, from the left hand side bar,  click on “Notifications”, “Notifications-&gt;Categories”, or “Notifications-&gt;Tags”.<br>

<p>The descriptions there are okay, but here is how they are different (from: <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/actual-difference-between-tracked-and-watching-first-post/61036/14">https://meta.discourse.org/t/actual-difference-between-tracked-and-watching-first-post/61036/14</a>)<br>
<strong>Watching:</strong> You receive a notification in the user menu, as well as an email for <em>each</em> post. Additionally, you will see “new” or an unread count for the topic.<br>
<strong>Watching First Post:</strong> You receive a notification in the user menu, as well as an email for the <em>first post only</em> . Additionally, you will see “new” or an unread count for the topic.<br>
<strong>Tracking:</strong> You will see “new” or an unread count for the topic.</p>
<p>The additional thing that might want is <strong>Muted</strong> as you could mute categories or tags that you don’t want to see. This could help you limit what is visible to you so it is less overwhelming.</p>

What I think would work well for your blog is using us as a way to initiate discussion and ask follow up questions to your articles.</p>
<p>We do ask that no one post topics that consist of “here a link to my thing” as want this to be a place for discusson, not a cork board for flyers and advertisements.</p>

              <p>Cool! So a Resources category could have the items I was talking about as subcats or topics, and they would be edited by the TL3+ community on an ongoing basis. It’s not I expected when I saw Wiki, but it actually makes parts of the Forum a Wiki. Cool!</p>
