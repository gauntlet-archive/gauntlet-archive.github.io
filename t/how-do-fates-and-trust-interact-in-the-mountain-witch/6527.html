          <p>Oh, interesting! A discussion of the Mountain Witch? A nice surprise.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve only played the game once, but it was a many-session, detailed and involved game, and highly successful.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt see any particular mechanical interactions between Trust and Dark Fates, but the tension is narrative:</p>
<p>The game encourages the characters to develop Trust with each other. At first, there‚Äôs little apparent reason not to keep giving the others more Trust.</p>
<p>The Dark Fates work against that, since the revelations and hints about each character‚Äôs true ‚Äúdark‚Äù nature start to foreshadow potential betrayals and sow seeds of tension in the group. It‚Äôs classic dramatic irony; we are seeing two people supporting each other and trusting each other ‚Äúon screen‚Äù, but, even as that happens, we are learning that one is cursed and the other is a murderer. How will all this end?</p>
<p>So, in that sense, these two mechanics or structures are pulling us in opposite directions.</p>

          <p>Thanks Paul, I‚Äôve never played it myself but I‚Äôve heard the trust/betrayal theme was well done so I was interested to see how it worked.</p>
<p>At first glance it didn‚Äôt seem like a lot of the fates were directly confrontational. I guess the GM needs to emphasize that to the players when making them. I couldn‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt just always trust each other. Why care if one of you has a secret love?</p>
<p>I guess I need to stop thinking of it as a team quest to kill the witch with some hidden objectives. It‚Äôs actually more like a competition to who can fulfill their objective and only cooperating when that helps you as an individual.</p>

          <p>That‚Äôs a good insight, I think.</p>
<p>The game will not work well if the players don‚Äôt get on the same page about the creative goals of the game. It‚Äôs not a game that‚Äôs so hard-coded that simply playing it will align you with its goals: instead, the players have to bring the right attitude and the right spirit to the game.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre not excited about the premise of a morally-grey story with conflicted characters, this game isn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúforce‚Äù that upon you. Write yourself a morally conflicted Dark Fate and then enjoy ‚Äúteasing‚Äù it to the other players - it‚Äôs very much the same sort of pleasure you might get as a GM in a more traditional game: you‚Äôre looking to create a difficult choice for the other players, to get an emotional reaction out of them, and to heighten the drama of the story you‚Äôre telling.</p>
<p>Contrast this with a game with clear victory conditions, like Mafia or The Resistance or Among Us, and you‚Äôll see what I mean: in those games, you play to win, as simple as that, and if you do anything else, you‚Äôre not really contributing.</p>
<p>In The Mountain Witch, there‚Äôs not much to enjoy by ‚Äúplaying optimally‚Äù: sure, you can ‚Äúwin‚Äù (i.e. kill the Witch) by making boring and good characters, with pretty obvious justifications for their Dark Fates, and cooperate the whole time. The game is quite deliberately ‚Äúrigged‚Äù, so that cooperating players are bound to kill the Witch, no problem. Overcoming the Witch isn‚Äôt the objective of this game.</p>
<p>Instead, think more like you‚Äôre making a Tarantino film together, and it‚Äôs each player‚Äôs job to heighten the tension and to make things interesting.</p>
<p>When I‚Äôm portraying my Dark Fate, I‚Äôm looking to create something which will really get a rise out of the other players/characters. Are you willing to ally with a man who, as a child, murdered his own parents? What if one of your companions is the son of the Witch (a la Luke Skywalker)? What will you do?</p>
<p>I hope that bit of orientation helps. I‚Äôm pretty sure one of the Dark Fates is, straight up, that you are some kind of servant of the Witch, but it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve looked at the text. On the other hand, ‚Äúwhy care if one of you has a secret love?‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs up to that player: if you draw ‚Äúsecret love‚Äù as your Dark Fate, the game is prompting you to make something interesting out of it. How can you make the ‚Äúsecret love‚Äù something interesting, complex, and explosive?</p>
<p>The GM gets to do this, too. Make the Witch someone who is morally gray, too. Make the Witch someone who will offer the characters the very thing they want most. When I played, my character was on a quest to avenge his dead wife. So the GM made the Witch someone who was experimenting with the boundary between life and death‚Ä¶ the Witch offered me the chance to be reunited with my beloved, if I would join with him and turn on my companions.</p>
<p>I hope that helps illustrate the situation.</p>

          <p>Definitely helps. I‚Äôm actually trying to hack BitD to make a Cold War spy game. I wanted to have PCs need to cooperate but also double cross if it helped them reach their ultimate goal. I‚Äôm thinking I could use Trust as written but also for resisting instead of Stress. Make Fates into Secrets. I think it could work.</p>

          <p>Right.</p>
<p>I think the real key here is to determine whether your game puts the <em>players</em> at odds with one another (as, say, Mafia does), or whether it‚Äôs a source of creative conflict for the <em>characters</em>. And then design accordingly.</p>
