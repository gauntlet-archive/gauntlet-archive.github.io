          <p>Thanks, Alun!</p>
<p>Danger Patrol was a game under development by John Harper about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>There is a website, and the game is free!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dangerpatrol.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dangerpatrol.com/</a></p>
<p>Then, at some point, John made a two-page version - the Pocket Danger Patrol, a well-loved game that has none of the complexity of the full game, but, for some, all the charm.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a wild pulp adventure kind of thing, zany and slightly boardgame-like, and purportedly tons of fun to play (especially for a one-shot with no prep). Uses mixed dice types in a clever way to distinguish character ability from dangerous circumstances.</p>
<p>There are lots of supplements and hacks out there, if you dig around - much like World of Dungeons.</p>

          <p>Well, I have played a fair bit of Pocket Danger Patrol, and thought about the game a lot. The RAW make for quite a fun game. The rules are short, and it‚Äôs easy to learn. It‚Äôs in my top three favorite games.</p>
<p>I use the number of threats that the basic pocket rules determine, but I add the threat type variation rules, and legend dice from Mike Olsen‚Äôs Dangerquest hack, AND the rewards rules, and rescue rules from John Aegard‚Äôs Gamma Patrol. I also sometimes use John Aegard‚Äôs threat layout.  Using the rewards means that you can play more than one session building it into a mini-campaign.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve played three mini-campaigns of it with my advanced English students: a fairy tale fantasy campaign, an Agents of Shields campaign, and a Gods and Demons (Á•ûÈ≠î) style campaign. They were all just light hacks of the rules. They were all quite a bit of fun; the students enjoyed them.</p>
<p>I have also seen playsets for Supernatural World War Two action adventure, a la Hell Boy, and super hero action adventure.</p>
<p>There was a guy named Seth Mc??? on the old Story-games board who even had rules for making it GMless. Sorry, I can‚Äôt remember his name.</p>
<p>I also posted my own hack on Story-games for playing Mission Impossible/Borne Identity type stories. But it never got any comments or any traction, so I don‚Äôt think anybody ever played it.</p>
<p>The only challenging thing about the rules is that you have to absolutely know the genre you‚Äôre trying to play (because of the threat tables, for one thing) But I never found that to be much of a problem for myself. Most players know the tropes and conventions of the genre they want to play. And if they do the game really sings.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.</p>

          <p>Thanks! Lovely.</p>
<p>I did review almost all of the Story Games threads on the game, which was very helpful.</p>
<p>My main questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you have [players]+3 threats in EVERY scene? Or total, within an adventure? How do you decide this, or use it to pace the game?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if you can‚Äôt think of that many threats, what do you do? Or is it always better to keep brainstorming until you can come up with that many? It sounds like a LOT, at least on paper.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Is the Threat/Danger countdown for each scene, or a larger counter that runs across scenes?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Is there any dice rolling outside of these setpiece combat scenes (a la the Danger Patrol ‚Äúsuspense scenes‚Äù), and, if so, how does it work?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you‚Äôre willing to throw up a quick example for each, that would be amazing!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I never saw your Mission Impossible hack! Can you share it, or link to it?</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: Found it!</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Let me see if I understand these:</p>
<p><em>Threat type variation rules</em> are from Danger Patrol, as well as from DangerQuest (which I‚Äôve found); they allow us to personalize and differentiate threats in interesting ways (like giving one a countdown, making another dependent on overcoming other, existing threats, etc).</p>
<p><em>Legend dice</em> are d12s, earned as rewards after overcoming certain threats.</p>
<p><em>Rescue rules</em> are placing a kidnapped hero on the map as a threat (presumably, the hero is dead for good once the threat countdown is completed?).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure I understand <em>John Aegard‚Äôs threat layout</em>. Is it the way he presents the threats around the village in Gamma Patrol? If so, I‚Äôm not sure how that makes gameplay any different.</p>

          <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<ol>
<li>total, used to pace the game.</li>
<li>Because I use the different threat types, usually some threats go together naturally to make a scene. As for the number of threats, it only took a little bit of brainstorming to get enough. One thing I didn‚Äôt mention above, not all the threats have to be sentient agents, but at least some of them do and they need motivations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The countdown clock or danger meter is for the whole game, but if it reaches zero, the heroes fail, and then there‚Äôs more scenes to play as things go from bad to worse.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>There‚Äôs no real scene types like in the full beta, but you could use them if you want. Once the game starts, the GM doesn‚Äôt role any dice, iirc.</li>
</ol>

          <p>How lovely! Thank you so much. I‚Äôm quite excited to actually try this game, once I fully wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>By the way, here‚Äôs Seth Magdich‚Äôs procedure for running the game as a pick-up one-shot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I start by dealing out cards with Mike Wight‚Äôs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191221035840/http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/16311/making-stuff-for-pocket-danger-patrol" rel="nofollow noopener">Ultra-Threat-o-Matic</a> items printed on them, then everyone places their favorite two or three Styles on the left side of the table and 2-3 Roles on the right. Before we choose from among them, I mention a few things for everyone to keep in mind about coherence and connections and it seems to work OK. This bit from that AP is fairly representative:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs line up the adjectives and the nouns like this, in a couple of columns more or less, and let‚Äôs eliminate all but five on each side. We‚Äôll pair them up to make the five Threats that the Danger Patrol is dealing with in this final episode. We‚Äôll be determining the scope and the nature of these final scenes based on what kind of Threats we decide are most entertaining. Let‚Äôs start by brainstorming some possible pairings. So, as you feel it, just go ahead and promote or demote some of these cards by moving them up or down the column here. Let‚Äôs consider which will fit together to form a coherent story, and make sure that we have Threats that are the result of other Threats, and they‚Äôre all related to each other.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Afterwards, I put a blank Danger Meter card on the table ‚Äúto represent the thing we‚Äôre protecting. The Threats will attack it each turn and if it‚Äôs hit too many times then we lose. Let‚Äôs decide what it means if we lose, what will be lost? What‚Äôs being threatened?‚Äù It‚Äôs usually Earth or The City or Reality. In that last game, it was Freedom. When a Threat hits the Danger Meter at the end of a round, I ask the Threat‚Äôs owner to describe how the Threat just brought us that much closer to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I just thought of another house rule that I sometimes use: if everyone agrees that a Threat is still too conceptually isolated after the opening flashback round, I‚Äôll ask the table to come up with a new Complication that‚Äôs somehow associated with both that isolated Threat and another better developed Threat, then put that Complication card in between those Threat cards to draw more attention to them and their connection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs causing the balance issue you mentioned, that must be frustrating. I‚Äôm actually not sure if the RAW is balanced, I only played it a couple of times before twisting it into a shorter GM-less shape with (players+1) Threats instead of (p+3), a 6-8 box Danger Meter and slightly lower Ability scores. Wins far outweigh losses, which players seem to enjoy. Sometimes I even bump a couple of Threats up to 8 or 10 hits but we still usually win with a heroic sacrifice or two at the end. For a while, I was ruling that the final game-ending Danger Meter hit could be cancelled by a hero Taking themselves Out to stop it. Maybe something like that would help?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the details, perhaps before I bother you further, I can look over this gem of a transcript I found:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191221091220/http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=546" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://web.archive.org/web/20191221091220/http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=546</a></p>

<p>Tell me how your ‚Äúcampaign play‚Äù worked. Was each session a ‚Äúnew one-shot‚Äù which followed the previous one‚Äôs story, like sequels to a movie, or was the action more continuous?</p>

          <p>More like episodes in a TV series or sequels of a move (although I never framed the game as a television series or movie franchise).</p>
<p>I mentioned before that I used the reward rules from gamma patrol. This helped give everybody a sense of development (since there‚Äôs no leveling in this game.) At the end of each adventure, at least a few characters had some buttons and badges and dodads that they would use in the next adventure.  So by the end of the campaign, the players had more than four bonus dice and/or higher than 2d10 stats. Some had allies, some had magic items, et cetera.</p>
<p>I never used Seth‚Äôs flashback scenes, but if I was going to play another campaign of this, I would definitely do that.</p>
<p>In fact, during my play, I didn‚Äôt really use flashback scenes at all. I think that that‚Äôs one way in which I kind of failed the table.  I wish that I had used flashback scenes more.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs one other thing about playing this game generally. As you probably noticed from Seth‚Äôs APs, the players don‚Äôt have to stay together as a group. They can face the threats as a whole group, in teams, or individually. And you can cut back and forth between the different scenes to heighten the tension. Also because the players are adding the dangers, too, it usually keeps them paying attention even when they‚Äôre not in the scene.</p>

<p>In his games, he has the group brainstorm all the Threats together (since he‚Äôs playing GMful/GMless).</p>
<p>Did you ever play the game in a more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù style, with a GM preparing a scenario, set of challenges, or storyline? (So that, in theory, you could even present your combination of threats as a ‚Äúmodule‚Äù of sorts, I suppose.)</p>

          <p>Hi Paul,<br>
I often played it in a traditional way with prep. But I never prepared a storyline or anything. I just created the threats as factions with agendas.</p>

          <p>Paul, you‚Äôve kind of gotten me excited about playing Pocket Danger Patrol again. I might get it out and see if I can find some local people who want to play. Actually think it‚Äôs a better game than Lasers and Feelings.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I like how Seth did this in his APs - the first scene would be, narratively, a flashback, but mechanically it still worked as a regular threat roll.</p>

          <p>I had a game session planned this evening, and one of the players didn‚Äôt show up.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Naturally, I suggested that‚Ä¶ I had something in my pocket which could do the job!</p>
<p>We were talking about Star Wars, so I said, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs play Pocket Danger Patrol in the Star Wars universe. I‚Äôll explain as we go!‚Äù</p>
<p>Everyone was on board.</p>
<p>We did setup, character creation, and one round in about two hours (maybe a little less), and we had a blast! I improvised some Abilities, which weren‚Äôt quite perfect, but worked well. (The list was very good, I think; however, categorizing them into two columns wasn‚Äôt really working out. We mixed and matched, which represented the fiction well: for instance, closing your eyes and trusting in the Force while operating the reactor could be Tech and The Force, even though they probably would both have been Role abilities.)</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun! Four contrasting heroes, and some wild hijinks.</p>
<p>Fortunately/unfortunately, we had amazing dice luck. On the first turn (we used Seth‚Äôs trick of making the first action a flashback), we eliminated three threats, including an Epic-level threat (8 hits to take out, regenerates one per turn) and one linked threat, while suffering almost no setbacks. (On my first roll, I rolled eight dice and managed ten successes!) It was exciting but also almost disappointing - I think we were all looking forward to seeing these in action.</p>
<p>We got two fantastic d12 outcomes, as well:</p>
<p>The Imperial asset, Asajj Ventress, is desperately in love with one of the heroes, and will probably show up to help later, at an opportune time.</p>
<p>My character now has the wonderful line - ‚ÄúThe heart of the black hole lives within me - d12‚Äù.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still curious about finding ways to make the game more organic. So far I‚Äôm following the lead of Seth‚Äôs writeups, and they‚Äôre quite mechanically driven.</p>
