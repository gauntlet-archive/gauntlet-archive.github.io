    <description>*Gauntlet Comics: E.X.T.R.A. Limited Series (The Ward Modern Medical Drama RPG)*

The dedicated health care professionals of Aesculapius Hospital&#39;s _Extrahuman Trauma Response Agency_ are brilliant and dedicated but otherwise normal people dealing with patients, and emergencies, that are anything but. We&#39;ll use Kevin Petker&#39;s The Ward: Modern Medical Drama to explore the 4-issue EXTRA limited series.

PLEASE NOTE: We&#39;ll use safety tools including the X-Card, Lines and Veils, and Open Door to make sure everyone has fun and feels safe, but the premise of the game requires some exploration of injury, stress, and the potential for substance abuse built-in. Please consider that carefully before singing up, and don&#39;t hesitate to contact me via Slack or Forum message if you have specific questions or concerns before signing up.

You may sign up for as many issues as you like, but all 4 will deliver the best play experience. Please sign up individually for each session.

THURSDAYS IN AUGUST at 8:00 PM Eastern! (Note skipping Aug 1 for GenCon and starting the 8th!)
