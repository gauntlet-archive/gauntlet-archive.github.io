**NOTE: Please only sign up if you&#39;re interested in playtesting!**

The all access time for this game is  June 15, 2020 9:00 PM Manila Time (GMT+8)

**You have been a Demon Lorde for hundreds, thousands of years. The armies of men and mage alike have trembled before you, begging for mercy. You remember those days quite fondly. As much fun as you’re having spending time with your new young Master and in their lovely coffee shop, you had no idea how difficult being a Devil Butler would be! (Not that you would ever let anyone know you were having a hard time!)**

**Can you help your young master&#39;s dreams come true and make this the best coffee shop ever? Or will your past catch up with you and wreak havoc?**

I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance.

***Better The Devil Who Serves You*** is a *Powered by the Apocalypse* game, inspired by the mechanics of Libreté, with a dash of Forged in the Dark.

**Touchstones:** Slice of Life and shoujo anime (especially those that focus on the service industry) and Butler Cafes.

**Content Warning** : Romance, the characters were Demon Lordes before becoming butlers.

**System**  : Better The Devil Who Sevres You (Powered by the Apocalypse)

**Duration**  : Four 3-hour sessions

**Breaks**  : 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : Yes, but made public only if consent by all the players

**Attendance**  : Joining all four sessions is ideal but not required, the first session will mostly be character and cafe creation

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, an open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.
