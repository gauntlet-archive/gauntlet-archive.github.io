    <title>Looking for Feedback on a Delta Green Character Keeper</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-for-feedback-on-a-delta-green-character-keeper/6227</link>
    <description>I am setting up a Character Keeper for Delta Green for use in an upcoming game (which isn&#39;t ready yet, so don&#39;t ask). This is my first pass at a full one, so I&#39;m mainly wondering if it makes sense? Have I left anything out? Added too much?

Here&#39;s a link to the Google Sheet. I&#39;m still populating the &quot;Pregens&quot; tab, but everything else is ready to look at. All feedback, good or bad, is welcomed. Thanks.
