    <description>I didn&#39;t know where this fits on the forums, but I&#39;ve been vibing with some minimalist rpg design lately. Yesterday, I made a business card-sized sci-fi game called [Free Traders](https://lari-assmuth.itch.io/free-traders). Feel free to check it out!

Do any of all y&#39;all have any cool minimalist rpg projects to share?

<p>Simple systems have smaller surface, so there’s less chance for problems, you can test them in their entirety, there are no sharp edges and stuff. But you can’t really extrapolate this to “this is the only way to have generic system” or even that simple becomes generic by the sheer virtue of being simple. There’s no single probability distribution for all events. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> But I guess I see what you’re saying.

<p>Ok, I see now why you’re going for rules explained through “actual” play in your other experiments. Neat, makes a lot of sense to do it this way. Personally I find the division of responsibilities and intent behind actions of participants to be the murkiest part of most indie RPGs.</p>

              <p>The original Delta6 (this is just the <em>business card edition</em>) was inspired by Cthulhu Dark and 3:16. The idea was to get a fully functional generic system to play anything I want. It has been play-tested by a good friend of mine and works well in practice (when Blades in the Dark was published, I took it as the confirmation of what I’ve suspected and you have just mentioned: the probability distribution is really nice).</p>
<hr>
<p>T3CS, on the other hand, is an exercise of minimalism. I’m kind of allergic to arbitrary rules and one day I wondered how a system without them will look like. Lots of rules that we currently see as <em>natural</em> are, indeed, quite arbitrary if you think about it: why <em>d20</em>? why <em>d6s</em>? why <em>hit points</em>? why <em>initiative</em>?</p>
<p>So I selected the most basic elements of a shared narration:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is conflict: So we need success &amp; failure.</li>
<li>There is drama: So we need the notion of partial success/failure.</li>
<li>There is uncertainty: So we need randomness (although I admit that this is questionable).</li>
<li>Not all character/circumstances are equal: So we need the notion of advantage/disadvantage (a generalization of stats, mods &amp; difficulties because, well, at the end of the day they all are the same thing mechanically).</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix all these elements with the Czege Principle (so you need to determine the narration rights in the most interesting way) while trying to avoid any arbitrary decision… and what you get should be pretty close to T3CS.</p>
<p>Regarding your comment… the <em>bland</em> distribution of T3CS has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being so coarse grained, it makes clear that this is not a simulationist system and that you should get your realism from the narration rather than from the system. I think that this is the only way to go when you want a truly generic system, because simple models are <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/09/17/robustness-of-simple-rules/" rel="nofollow noopener">more robust</a> and less prone to be interpreted as anything but <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/05/25/crude-models/" rel="nofollow noopener">the crude version of reality</a> that they are (all RPG systems are crude, T3CS just doesn’t pretend otherwise).</li>
<li>Partial successes/failures are the most realistic and dramatic outcomes. In T3CS they automatically are the most common outcome in all situations.</li>
<li>You already have everything you need to play in your pocket. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">
</li>
</ul>
<p>This being said, I believe that the heart of the system is in the narration rights assignment rather than in its probability distribution. I mean, you are mainly deciding who gets the narrative power and that person should use the <em>total/partial success/failure</em> outcome as a prompt (see <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/other-skylines" rel="nofollow noopener">Other Skylines</a> for similar implementation of this idea).</p>
<p>Anyway, this system does not pretend to be anything but a simple way to improvise games on the go, which is the main niche for <em>business card sized</em> RPGs  <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlosluna">@CarlosLuna</a> I like the probability distribution in your delta6 system. It’s got a lot of flavor out of the box. By comparison 3 coins system seems extremely bland: a 50:50 chance of success that tilts to 75:25 either way with a fixed coin. But I think there’s a lot of potential in a coin based conflict resolution, it’s a neat idea nevertheless. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It’s just a simple resolution mechanic for improvised games on the go (like playing some scenes in a train/road trip or while waiting your meal in a restaurant) but the way it assigns the narration rights (player gets <em>complete success</em> and <em>partial failure</em> and the GM/table gets <em>partial success</em> and <em>complete failure</em>) and the implicit definition of <em>advantage/disadvantage</em> (you have <em>advantage/disadvantage</em> if a <em>complete failure/success</em> is impossible) help a lot to get the game flowing.</p>
