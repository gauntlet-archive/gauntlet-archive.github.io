You’ve been stuck on this asteroid depot — aces, freighters, caravans, and everything in between stopping for fuel and that’s it — for who knows how long. Long enough for the bartender to know your name and the bounty agent to wish they didn’t. You and your squad are bored and the opportunity of a lifetime’s about to drop in your lap. Maybe you’ll be thankful for it. Maybe it’ll get you off of this rock, at least. It doesn’t matter really: you’re an ace and that’s what aces do. They take the contract too gray for any self-respecting nation-state to vet and usually too difficult for any run-of-the-mill private security. At least you’ll be able to finally get a good drink, that much is for sure.

These are four sessions of *Debt and Metal* by Darren Brockes, a game of mecha and mercenaries Rooted in Trophy. This is a playtest. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend.

We’ll use [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/) and [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/). I’ll email all players about a week before the session with necessary information and links.

**Content Warnings:**  violent conflict, psychosomatic harm, capitalism
**Safety Tools:**  [Script Change](http://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/), [Lines and Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913), the [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)
