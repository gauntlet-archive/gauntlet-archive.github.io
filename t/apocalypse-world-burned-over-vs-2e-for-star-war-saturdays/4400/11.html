          <p>Rich,</p>
<p>I’m really curious about the choice of “Burned Over” instead of Apocalypse World (as in past SWS games). Was this a careful and deliberate choice, based on design features? Just an excuse to try something different? Or something in between?</p>
<p>How do you expect it to play differently?</p>

<p>Oh gosh, you give me too much credit, Paul! I don’t do much in gaming that’s careful and deliberate, especially when I post games on the calendar two months ahead of time. Often, I’ll post a game I’m interested in as a challenge to learn it in the next month or so.</p>
<p>That said, I do a podcast on PbtA games and felt compelled to learn the Burned Over rules. I’m terrible at learning games simply by reading, so I decided to post it up!</p>

<ul>
<li>The Basic Moves overhaul are clearer on combat for me, I’m interested in seeing how slick it works in play.</li>
<li>I LOVE the revised Help and Interrupting rules, it’s really cool (Cartel’s probably still my favorite help rules) that two players can both roll for an action, it’s something I’ve never before, quite exciting.</li>
<li>The approach of taking some of the playbook-specific moves (dealing with a gang and workspace moves) and making them Basic Moves is super interesting. Makes sense with all the new playbooks.</li>
<li>AND ALL THE NEW PLAYBOOKS! I’m stoked to see these in play, they’re wild and evocative.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent some time last night pestering <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/ferret">@Ferret</a> about the Environ rules (he’s really got AW:BO down!). I’m excited to see those in play, they’re a sharp new approach to abstracting rules for disasters.<br>
I haven’t gotten to Hard Zones yet, which is next on my list.</p>
<p>I’ve had so much fun digging into these rules that I’m working with <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/william_nichols">@William_Nichols</a> on a full-on Star Wars hack of them for April.</p>

          <p>I’m currently in a AW:BO campaign (3rd session) and I can tell you, it’s really worth it! I really like the new playbooks over the old ones. I feel they make the game more about belonging to some place or people. For instance I’m playing the Medic, with a place and a cult (of Death, because playing the “opposite” of a playbook is quite fun, right?). It’s hard not to care about anything with the new playbooks. And the hard zones are pretty cool too!</p>

          <p>Great answer, Rich! I heard the discussion about Burned Over on the podcast, and decided to come here to ask you some questions. I also like some of the minor changes in these rules - like the Helping rules, which, along with Cartel and Freebooting Venus (and maybe my own ‘The Bureau’), are some of the best PbtA helping rules yet.</p>
<p>Do the interrupting rules work <em>only</em> for highly interruptible moves, or anything that’s happening?</p>
<p>I’m a bit torn on Burned Over, because I appreciate the improvements and generally greater elegance of the rules compared to AW2, but I don’t really <em>want</em> a softer or less “adult” version of the game. It’s a bit unfortunate, from my perspective, that they “come together”, as a package. Not too sure what to do about that, but perhaps someone else will, sooner or later!</p>
<p>Will you come back here to give your thoughts on Hard Zones and other elements particular to BO?</p>
<p>I really like this tradition you have made out of doing Star Wars in different game systems. I hope you will write about and/or share the hack you’re working on when it’s done! That sounds like exciting stuff.</p>
<p>Did you ever publish anything about your Cartel Star Wars hack? Any playbooks, writeups, etc? It’s something I’m quite curious about trying myself.</p>

</aside>
<p>Interrupting works for everything, but on the moves marked as “highly interruptable”, the digital zine says:<br>
“When you make a <em><strong>highly interruptible</strong></em> move, marked with *, you should announce that you’re making it and explicitly give everyone a chance to interrupt you. Otherwise, they can call a do-over and retroactively interrupt you if they want, even after you’ve finished your move and play’s continued on.”</p>

<p>I’m glad you like the SWS approach, it’s been helpful for me to learn more about game designs. I’m pretty sure <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/william_nichols">@William_Nichols</a> and I will share some progress on Burned Over Star Wars once we’ve gotten the hack to a playable state (goal is APRIL!)</p>
<p>As for Hutt Cartel, it’s such a light reskin, that anything I put out would just be <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/magpiemark">@MagpieMark</a> 's work reprinted. It really is Cartel with pew pew words.</p>

          <p>That’s great, Rich. I’m very keen to hear about all that as it happens. I hope you will share with us!</p>
<p>I can expand a bit on my questions:</p>
<p>I’m curious about the design of the Interrupt move because the materials I have don’t explain how and and when to use it. (Maybe the Zine does?)</p>
<p>It seems, on paper, highly effective and desirable as a move (even on a miss, nothing really bad happens), so I’m curious what limitations are in place for using it. In terms of the conversation at the table, when is it appropriate to use? Perhaps this will be something to discuss after you play, but I figured that since part of the goal of this series is to learn new games and systems, you might enjoy engaging in some discussion now.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m also curious about your experiences with other games in the series. It looks like you did Star Wars via DitV recently! How did that go?</p>
<p>For Hutt Cartel, did you find it difficult to make the kind of story and characters fit into a Star Wars universe? Did you end up with something that felt like a game of Cartel with some Star Wars gloss, or did it manage to feel more Star Wars-y than that?</p>

          <p>As one of the players, I think it felt very much like Star Wars even if the drug dealing theme is a little bit on the edge of that experience for me. It still fits with the Star Wars universe but it doesn’t aim for the core Star Wars experience, if that makes sense?</p>
<p>I haven’t played Cartel before so I can’t compare it to this, but to me this felt like a Star Wars game with an unusual theme rather than a narcofic game with a pasted on Star Wars theme.</p>

<p>The zine does cover interrupts with more depth. I’m not entirely sure how it will play out at the table, but I’m excited to see it happen!</p>
<p>As for the Hutt Cartel question, I’ll go with <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/anders">@Anders</a> answer there, it mirrors my own experience. Also, Anders was such an awesome Trandoshan Assassin! I think <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/blaise">@Blaise</a> would be proud!</p>

<p>Do you know what differences, if any, exist between the Patreon preview of the game (PDF) that Vincent put out and the version published in the zine?</p>
<p>Are people missing out if they play the rules from the Patreon preview?</p>
<p>(Edit: I haven’t looked carefully at the specifics of the playbooks and moves - or other such minutiae - but I am looking at the zine, and the text there is quite thorough, and quite good. I highly recommend it to anyone who’s interested in playing this!)</p>

          <p>Following up on this further, do you (Rich; or any other readers) have any special thoughts or advice on adapting Burned Over to Star Wars play?</p>
<p>Are there playbooks, moves, or rules that you want to omit? Change? Add? Why?</p>
<p>How will you deal with Hard Zones and other aspects of the rules?</p>
<p>Do any of the changes in the rules from AW2e seem particular well suited - or poorly suited - to the Star Wars genre/setting?</p>
<p>What jumps out at you?</p>
<p>For example, I find the omission of the “hot” stat interesting. In AW, you can be sexy and charming and persuasive without necessarily being alert and quick on the draw. In BO, though, you’re always both: if you’re charming and sexy and persuasive, you’re also <em>cool under fire</em>. That’s interesting.</p>

          <p>I had a chance to play a nice, long session of Burned Over in Star Wars yesterday, so I’m going to write a quick report on it here. (<a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/funkaoshi">@funkaoshi</a> was one of  the players, if he wants to chime in.)</p>
<p>This got fairly lengthy; read as much or as little as you want - I get into the playbooks and rules details in some detail later one (after the quick session summary).</p>
<p>I took a pretty heavily front-loaded approach, by throwing all kinds of prompts at the players, including a few questions about Star Wars characters (a framework I put together for creating something like a “opening” Star Wars film, a la New Hope or A Force Awakens) and a sort of “playset” about a town on a desert planet (originally for Apocalypse World), which includes some Love Letters (each player chose one). There was a lot of stuff, and we trimmed down (ignoring unnecessary bits) rather than building up.</p>
<p>The results were very successful. We ended up with two really neat characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An ex-Imperial military droid that had been reprogrammed by someone a long time ago. This person had a portion of their own brain removed and inserted into the droid, to give it a sort of semi-human sentience, and the droid was now living on Tatooine, working for Teemo the Hutt (thanks to Rich for the Teemo character - I don’t normally do much character voices, but doing the throaty Hutt laugh was strangely satisfying!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In flies an offworlder - a smuggler wearing ill-fitting bounty hunter armour (clearly not his own!). He’s a force sensitive pilot with a destiny tied to the Dark Side (though he is not aware of that himself), with unconscious Force talents allowing him to manipulate people. Mechanically, he is a Brain-Picker using “in-brain puppet strings”, but the character thinks he is just the beneficiary of quick thinking and good luck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It turns out that he is bringing cargo with him: a large, coffin-like, black floating slab. What’s inside? He doesn’t know, and hasn’t ever looked… until the droid tells him that the man he is supposed to find (the buyer) is a mysterious figure rumoured to be both a slaver and a cannibal (thanks to my Apocalypse World starter material!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Teemo the Hutt, with his Gamorrean guards (and, it seems, everyone else!) comes sniffing around this mysterious cargo, the droid takes advantage of the tense situation to open up the black coffin… and inside is a young woman, dressed like royalty, frozen in carbonite.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The smuggler, torn and uncertain (clearly struggling with moral questions here, in very Star Wars-appropriate manner), begins to try to unravel the situation, and blaster fire and exciting chases ensue, ending with the mysterious “buyer” cutting his way onto his fleeing ship with a lightsaber.</p>
<p>The session went well, with lots of great, creative ideas from the players (they established most of the background details above in response to my prompts), and the rules worked quite smoothly.</p>
<p>The smuggler is a Brain-Picker, with the low Aggro score inspiring the player to portray him as a bit nervous and non-confrontational, relying on his “in-brain puppet strings” to get what he wants. The droid is a Vigilant, which fit really nicely with his role as an ex-Imperial military droid working as a sort of guard/technician. He didn’t get to use the Vigilant moves much, but they suit the character well. (I didn’t get to work in the “wolves of the maelstrom” just yet, but if we play again, that seems to suggest all kinds of fun Star Wars weirdness.)</p>
<p>We treated the psychic maelstrom kind of like an eerie emanation of destiny and Dark Side fuckery, somewhat like in the Rise of Skywalker. It didn’t come into play a whole lot in our session, but everyone liked the implications.</p>
<p>Overall, the design is a little bit slicker/more polished than AW2e, which I enjoyed. I don’t find the playbooks as evocative or easy to grasp than AW’s - perhaps because they seem a bit more abstract in nature - but that worked really well for reskinning (since they can be interpreted more loosely/creatively). So, this could be a good tradeoff for our purposes.</p>
<p>Some specific notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I liked the “1st Impressions”, instead of “look”: both players seem to take inspiration from these to give their characters more personality (the Vigilant was “calm, thoughtful, and unhurried”, whereas the Brain-Picker was “cold and nervous” - suiting his mysterious connection to the Dark Side well).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new Brain-Picker gear is written somewhat ambiguously (compared to the original Brainer), relying on precise wording to be interpreted. We struggled with how the “in-eye brain lenses” interact with the moves, for example (the player thought “taking the time to study them” is equivalent to “time and opportunity to work on someone”, which makes total sense, but I’m pretty sure it’s the Bakers’s intention here for that wording to be so precise for a reason - i.e. the lenses apply to “deep brain scan”, but not “in-brain puppet strings”, with the descriptions of the gear and moves corresponding exactly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moves are fairly loose and abstract in comparison to AW’s in places; this can make you feel like you have less support, but allows greater flexibility. So far, that worked well for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The triggers for Confront Someone and Charm or Deceive Someone are a little ambiguous, but we got by by looking at the consequences of each move and choosing the right move accordingly. For example, “bluff someone” (“Confront…”) and “deceive someone” (“Charm or Deceive…”) aren’t all that different, so it’s easy to think you should be using one move instead of the other if you’re just reading the written trigger. We had a situation where the droid pretended to “power down”, turning himself off, which was clearly an attempt to “deceive someone”, but the outcomes of that move didn’t suit the situation very well (so we went with “acting under fire”, instead). [Edit: I later found a little footnote on this in the “Tags” section, under Stealth, which basically helps you reconcile those two moves - if you look at its advice, the outcomes are pretty similar. So that’s worth looking up!]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no longer any option to “interfere” with someone else’s move. Personally, I didn’t miss it! Interrupting someone’s move feels much more vivid and real in the fiction. I still find it odd that interrupting “always works” (“on a miss, you still interrupt them”), but I’ll have to play more to get a sense of how that shakes out. The new Helping rule is great!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For someone playing for the first time, it’s good to note that the Harm moves aren’t part of the Standard Moves reference, which seems like a bit of an oversight (digging them up in the zine isn’t obvious!). And I think that the MC has to roll Vehicle harm for NPC vehicles, in combat situations, which is also kind of an odd departure from how most things work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Vigilant says that the character starts with Devotion, but we had no idea why. An error, maybe?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vehicle moves are simplified (compared to AW2e), and I see that as a very welcome redesign. Sleeker and easier to use. “Deal with bad terrain” is perfect for Star Wars. “Outdrive another vehicle” also works well, although it assumes that the vehicles are bumping into and damaging each other. We used the v-harm numbers to interpret them <em>shooting at one another</em>, and that seemed to work OK for now (assuming that a bigger ship has more guns and can take more punishment seems reasonable enough!). It’s really hard to actually destroy another vehicle, though, so don’t expect to be blowing up TIE fighters one after the other!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not 100% sold on all the “secret spend” moves, like Do Battle and Outdrive… - they work fine in practical terms, but I’m not sure I like the aesthetics of it. A purely personal thing, though! You may feel differently. I <em>do</em> feel a lot more confident handling PvP combat with the Do Battle move (compared to Seize by Force), so that’s a big plus. (And the ‘seize initiative’ clause worked well to represent an ambush, simply by assuming that the attacker already “seized the initiative” before the Battle began. That felt at once obvious and inspired, when the idea popped into my head.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “psi” rating seems like a good match for Star Wars, although I don’t know if psi-harm is. (It didn’t come up yet in our game! I think it would “feel” right for Dark Side psychic stuff but not Light Side Jedi things, but that’s just my guess so far.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We didn’t play long enough for me to get a good sense of the experience rules - we missed highlighting a bit, and I’m not sure repeatedly checking off and erasing all the bubbles is worth the trouble, compared to marking experience on a miss, but I liked them in principle - the encouragement to use a variety of things on your sheet is a great feature. (The rules aren’t super clear on whether you get XP for using a playbook move, but I’d say that’s the most logical interpretation of “rolling the stat”, so we did.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hard Zones weren’t used (since we already had a setting and situation), but they seem like more of a detail/prompt/setting aid than something structurally important. (If I’m wrong, I’d like to hear about it! None of our character had Hard Zone-based prompts, so it’s possible the game would feel different if they had.) Most of the Hard Zones would fit well in a Star Wars setting, however! (I suppose that, in Star Wars, they would actually describe <em>planets</em>…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gamechangers didn’t come up (we’re not planning to play more than two sessions at the moment). I like them a lot in principle!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like the Lawmaker’s <em>Forbidding Presence</em> move could use a “your call” clause, like the Operator’s <em>Reputation</em>. Otherwise, it’s a bit hard to gauge. Same goes for the Volatile’s <em>Dangerous Presence</em>, I suppose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I mentioned above, some of the playbooks’ ties to people and communities could work against a lot of typical Star Wars situations or plots, so that’s good to be aware of. (For instance, if your game is about a small band of smugglers flying around in the Millenium Falcon, you might have trouble with the Medic playbook.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really liked that there fewer (almost no!) purely mechanical moves, like AW’s stat substitution moves. Every move says something about the character, which I prefer. I don’t know about the "add an automatic question to <em>read a situation</em>; it seems to go against the idea of a “charged situation” in some cases, but it didn’t come up in play, so I should hold off on judgement in this case - maybe it plays just great! Also, <em>Rewired Reflexes</em> is a particularly interesting move in this respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept and moves for the Undaunted seem to be screaming out for a Jedi character (seriously, just look at that!), but the other character details don’t necessarily fit (being a protective parent, being unarmed, etc). The Vigilant has hints of a Ben Kenobi-type character, as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Weaponized is a bit of an odd playbook, and I’m not sure if it could work in the Star Wars context without some thinking. However, its “molecular-edged long blade” seems like a good candidate for lightsaber stats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinpoints and Terrain are a very natural fit for Star Wars - of course! A great tool for this purpose. Pinpoints are all over the place in Star Wars stories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(<a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/lumpley">@lumpley</a>, if you’re looking for feedback on Burned Over, here you go! I apologize for the Star Wars focus - obviously not likely what you intended. Ha!)</p>

          <p>Another note that rather suprised me:</p>
<p>Although the naming conventions are so wildly different, we found that a LOT of AW/Burned Over names actually sound pretty fitting in a Star Wars universe. A happy discovery! Somehow I didn’t expect that, but there are a lot of single-syllable names and nicknames that seem pretty apposite. We had a Dustwich and an Ambergrease, for example, and (picking from the two character playbooks) Marsh, Lively, Burroughs, Gritch, Iris, Marie, Cybelle, Brace, Sundown, Zand, Vann, Cezar, Rowan, Greta, Zeus, Hanna, Orion, Fenris, Zmeya, Gargoyle, Vulture, Raven, Peregrine, Mongoose, Widow all seem like they “work” in the setting, especially for human characters (the proper name-sounding ones) and aliens (the nickname-like ones). Other good names from the NPC list include Preen, Crine, Ik, Shan, Isle, Ula, Ba, Roark, Rum, Wisher, Partridge, Krin, Grome, Clarion, Haridan, and many others. It was a pleasant surprise to see that playing this even without a list of Star Wars names didn’t leave us hanging. You - the truly devoted Star Wars fan and GM - probably DO have such a list on hand, but it’s good to see that you can easily get by without it!</p>

          <p>Somehow I got confused and continued writing about this in another thread. I’ll copy the text here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We continued the Star Wars Burned Over game tonight. I won’t go into great detail; I don’t have too much to add to my comments from last time. It’s still working relatively well, although there are some things I don’t love (e.g. two ships doing harm to each other via bidding during a chase, and not having the harm moves on the pages with the handouts).</p>
<p>A new player joined us. He’s portraying Rothschild, the rather questionable Imperial engineer/scientist who is on the run and has been captured by the organization of the elusive “Butcher”. He’s the one who created Valiant-1, the droid character that uses a portion of his own brain. During the shocking events and the canyon chase, Ambergrease shows in the Butcher’s caverns, and Rothschild uses a hammer to take down a stormtrooper.</p>
<p>We had our first use of “open your brain”, to confer with the mystical/Force/destiny, and the character experienced a chilling vision or premonition. I hope to see more of that in the future! It’s easy to forget that the move even exists, in the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>Lots of things are coming together, and it’s clear that some major players are all converging on this spot. What’s happening here? We’ll find out next time, in what will most likely be the finale.</p>

<p>And then the final session:</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, the game has been wrapped up. We played three fairly full sessions. And, although there was definitely a lot more room to explore, it felt like enough of a climax that we were happy to stop playing (it doesn’t help that one of our players is leaving the city, so scheduling more sessions might have been difficult!).</p>
<p>I think we all had a good time, and enjoyed what the rules brought to the game. Sure, they’re not  <em>perfect</em>  for Star Wars, but they worked pretty darn well. They were few things that didn’t feel right or didn’t fit. We had little trouble in terms of adapting the rules. The ability to die and come back to life (by choosing +1 Weird, in most cases!) felt very Star Wars-like (especially with the JJ Abrams films, which love to do the whole “Oh, no! He’s dead!” fakeout scene, and use it on multiple occasions).</p>
<p>None of us loved the “Do Battle” move, but, on the upside, there was never any confusion about how to use it. Players almost always chose “Fight hard” (+1 harm), as it was devastatingly effective against NPCs. (But it helps to explain why two of them died - and came back - in the third session!)</p>
<p>In the third part of our game, most of the mysterious convergences happening on Tatooine came to light, although the players were just starting to figure them out, learning bits in dribs and drabs. The most mysterious character was “The Butcher”, who turned out to be a Jedi in hiding, wearing a mask and some kind of cybernetic device in his skull after being mortally wounded by Darth Vader.</p>
<p>Our smuggler,  <strong>Marsh</strong>  (a  <em>Brain-picker</em> ), it turned out, was transporting a young princess frozen in carbonite, who was actually a Rebellion agent trying to get in touch with  <strong>Rothschild</strong>  (a  <em>Gearcutter</em> ), a former Imperial cynernetics engineer working for the Butcher. The smuggler rather accidentally (in typical Star Wars fashion!) joined up with  <strong>Valiant-1</strong>  (a  <em>Vigilant</em> ), a former Imperial droid who was also looking for Rothschild, since Rothschild was his creator (and, in fact, had placed a portion of his brain matter into the droid!).</p>
<p>Local slumlord Teemo the Hutt was after the cargo, knowing that there was a high bounty placed on the frozen Princess, so there was some wild canyon chase action when Teemo’s Gamorrean guards pursued the smuggler’s ship. Teemo had all kinds of mercenaries trying to find the girl!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a local enforcer named Ambergrease had sold out the Butcher to the Empire, using Imperial support in a plan to take control of the Cistern (the only source of fresh water, and the Butcher’s hideout) and then to take over the town from Teemo.</p>
<p>However, the PCs, being intrepid, killed several inflitrator Stormtroopers, as well as, eventually, when all this came to a head in a shootout at the Cistern, killed Ambergrease, whose corpse now floats in the water supply, tainting it with a metallic tang.</p>
<p>There was a particular Star Wars-y moment when Valiant-1 one pushed a floating coffin (the carbonite container) into a crowd of the Butcher’s followers, knocking them over like bowling pins and then leapt off the coffin, somersaulting over those who remained standing, and made his escape. Classic!</p>
<p>They stole a whole bunch of cybernetic details and data as well as a mysterious Dark artifact (never seen “on screen”, just in a dusty box) from the Butcher’s vault, figured out that Rothschild was the Princess’s long lost father, and made their escape. Rothschild managed to jerry-rig a floating gurney-like contraption to carry the materials, which was a Star Wars-analogue of Tenser’s Floating Disk.</p>
<p>Presumably the sequel would deal with their pursuit by both the Empire and the Butcher, a man whose Light or Dark affiliation is heavily in question.</p>
<p>We had fun adapting some of the details in the playbooks to the game, although, to my regret, I never quite managed to tie in the whole “wolves of the mealstrom” bit successfully (despite having some ideas for how that tied The Butcher, Marsh, and the darker personalities in the Emperor’s service together, it never “made it to the screen” in our limited time). A few failed “open your brain” rolls provided short cut scenes hinting at a dark past or grim omens of a dark future, which I enjoyed narrating (though I’m not sure how the players felt about these!).</p>
<p>I liked how the storylines converged on the mysterious cybernetic secrets worked on by the Empire. My idea was that Rothschild’s experiments were key to technologies used in Darth Vader’s machine suit, as well as the Butcher’s head trauma. The Rebels were trying to get Rothschild on their side to find a way to neutralize or defeat Darth Vader, while Rothschild’s daughter, Leora, hoped to turn The Butcher back to the Light. Marsh, the smuggler, however, shared some dark destiny with the Butcher, which would play a bigger role in future sessions, were we continuing to play.</p>
<p>I didn’t spoonfeed the background story or situation to the players, so I don’t know if it was as engaging for them, discovering it in pieces and hints, rather than seeing it all at once.</p>
<p>The nature of all the supernatural stuff in the ruleset lends a bit of darker vibe to the Star Wars setting and anything related to the Force, but this is a nice lens through which to see Star Wars and relates nicely to the way this stuff is presented in the newest films (weird psychic connections, coincidences, and whispers from the past - all very maelstrom-like).</p>
<p>Were I to make a serious go at playing Star Wars with the Burned Over ruleset, I’d feel pretty good doing so. I’d want some more clarity on how to use “open your brain” (presumably, it would work for all uses of “trusting the Force” and similar situations, and that might require either some thought or a new move), and I would want stronger character transformation mechanics, since the Star Wars film feature dramatic character arcs, and it would be nice to have some support for this from the system. Aside from those two things (and maybe some greater clarity on ship to ship combat), we had a lovely time and I would gladly do it again.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And a note:</p>
<p>I didn’t notice at first, but Burned Over has the harm move rewritten as a positive roll - that is, you want to roll high, unlike in AW. You subtract the harm done from your roll.</p>
<p>This is an odd change. It’s certainly nice that the roll doesn’t invert the desired outcomes (high is good, as usual!), but the side effect is that the harm rolls are much worse for you - depending on the exact numbers, it’s often the equivalent of rolling at -2 (compared to AW). For instance, 2 harm in AW means 2d6+2, giving you a 1/6 chance (roughly) of the best possible outcome on the harm move. In Burned Over, though, you’re rolling 2d6-2, so your odds of the best possible outcome are now only 1/36! Quite a change, and it applies to all the variations (e.g. vehicular harm).</p>
