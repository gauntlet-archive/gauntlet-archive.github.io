    <description>Join me (Larry S) to play a one-shot of Psi*Run - a game by Meguey Baker about amnesiacs with volatile powers on the run from their mysterious captors: the Chasers! Our story starts with our escape. Will we avoid capture long enough to figure out who we are and how we got this way? Let&#39;s play to find out!

This game was originally designed for play with a GM. As the good folks at The Farrier&#39;s Bellows podcast pointed out, however, the game should also lend itself to GM-less play with a few modifications. Let&#39;s find out if it works!

The session will begin on Friday, July 12th, at 6:30 P.M. EST and last for four (4) hours. Sign up below!

[date=2019-07-12 time=18:30:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-07-12 time=22:30:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] https://tinyurl.com/PsiRunIsFun

I want you to have a fun and safe game. Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy will be in effect: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html. We will establish lines and veils at the top of the session. The X-card is also available during play. If you aren&#39;t comfortable raising an issue yourself, please feel free to privately message me so I can address it as the facilitator. I also welcome critical feedback of myself.</description>

              <p>Hi Christopher, the “focal character” meant that in each scene, one character would be in the spotlight while the other players took a back seat and played the opposition or the surroundings.</p>
<p>…we actually abandoned this idea in our first scene, because Ben’s character was the one who had the best solution to our problem. But otherwise, we managed to switch the spotlight around quite well - it was a bit more unstructured then Larry had planned for, I think, but we managed to create a pretty satisfying story with lots of mayhem and shenanigans. Not too many memories, sadly, because mostly something else seemed more important than recovering them.</p>

              <p>I think I’m going to try a rotating focal character – sort of like Vast &amp; Starlit.  They will be responsible for setting the scene and will be the primary actor. The other players can of course embody their own characters but should keep the spotlight on the focal character and also collectively represent the Chasers and the rest of the world. As soon as the dice are rolled, the focus shifts to the next player – i.e., a player can’t roll twice in a row. Also, whenever the Risk Sheet says “GM has first say,” we will just interpret that as “other players have first say.” What do you think?</p>
