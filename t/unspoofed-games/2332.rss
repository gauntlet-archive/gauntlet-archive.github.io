I edit a small RPG-zine, in it there&#39;s this running gag where the contributors review or promote things that don&#39;t exist.

But if this game did exist, what would it be like?

I invite you to post your own spoofs in the thread, show us games that never were, and regale us with stories about playing them.</description>

              <p>Oh man, I played this D&amp;D 4E hack called <em>Philosophers &amp; Demigods</em> and I’ve been looking for an excuse to talk about it.</p>
<p>It’s set in mythological Greece but it’s more of a superhero game than anything else. Each major city or region has a group of heroes called a <em>band</em>, like “the Athenian Band” or “the Band of Thebes”, but they’re more friendly rivals than open enemies even when their home cities are at war. Instead their real enemies are titan spawned monsters, hubristic madmen, and barbarian warlords who threaten all of civilization (meaning Greek civilization).</p>
<p>Individual characters each have an origin which describes the source of their powers. These are fairly broad - Demigods are descended from or otherwise empowered by the gods, Philosophers have achieved a deeper understanding of reality, Hephaesteans have constructed clockwork armors or other mechanical devices, Olympians have perfected their bodies through training and competitions, and Volcanists have been transformed through contact with volcanic gases or other rare elements. (I’m probably forgetting one or two.)</p>
<p>Instead of a class you got two power sets. Like my character (a Volcanist) had Myrmidon which gives you armor and some defender-ish abilities, and Elementalist focused on fire so I could throw fireballs and set things on fire and, y’know, burn stuff. One of the others had a Philosopher who had Pankration (basically martial arts) and Oracle (she had some kind of supernatural senses and could evade attacks by seeing the future).</p>
<p>The skill list was mostly standard 4E and skill challenges were mostly the same, but all the equipment was just description on top of your powers. Feats were more big abilities like in 5e than the endless number of small bonuses.</p>
<p>I remember the last fight was against this massive sea dragon turtle thing that was besieging the harbor in Athens with an army of trident-wielding fishmen which I think were just reskinned Kuo-toa.</p>

<p>I once wrote a game about losers working in a dead-end office job, a la Dilbert meets Office Space, so maybe I shouldn’t point fingers, though.</p>
<p>It was called <em>Impotence: the Impairment</em>, and there was a diceless version as well as one which worked on Fudge dice. Also, the office workers spent their free time playing a fantasy MMORPG together, which was part of the game (and had really clever simplified D&amp;D rules!).</p>
<p>Ah. That was a long time ago. I don’t know if I should be sad that I never played… or glad. I certainly had a lot of fun writing it. I had a lot less sense back then! <em>(he says, eyeing the title suspiciously)</em></p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’ve been playing <em>The Year of Our SWORD</em> with my local group a lot lately. It’s about as silly as it sounds. It’s about not-Christian knights who belong to not-Christian military orders and they fight each other in not-Reformation wars. It’s all set in not-Europe, complete with anachronism that I’m confident the authors never even studied (or knew) what kind of place Europe is. But get this - the best part is that this is an <em>orthodox wuxia</em> TTRPG.</p>
<p>I’ve read that the designer wanted to make a game that parodies Western orientalist depictions of the Far East, with how it’s a mystical and fantastic land populated entirely by kung fu warriors. This is kinda personal but I don’t know if I really align with their stance or their approach… but <em>The Year</em> is a complete guilty pleasure for me.</p>
<p>Anyways, the game is pretty simple. Trad-ish. You need a small handful of d6s and a d4 (the BLADE and the TIP as the game calls it). You roll them and the techniques you can pull off are based on what numbers you roll. So, for example, the BLADE rolls two evens and a 6, and the TIP rolls a high. Then I can execute CRUCIFIX AWL TRIPLE SLASH, a super technique available only to the Light Defender Order. Most techniques are simpler than that, but I used that as an example since it sounds so silly. It’s got a clunky action economy system, though, but I recognize that it kinda helps literary wuxia combat scene flow.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t know how well this would be received by an audience that actually <em>lives</em> in Western cultures (it’s sometimes super mean and offensive with the parody aspect, and intentionally so). But if you can get past that, I’d recommend trying it.</p>
