**The Gauntleteer is Missing! A Gauntlet Comics Summer Crossover.**

*The Gauntleteer has taken many forms throughout the history of New Gauntlet City, but always they are a beacon of hope and an anchor of stability. Suddenly, the Gauntleteer is missing... and only you heroes even remember they existed! Can you save an aspect of the Gauntleteer and restore balance to your era?*

-----------------------------------

**It&#39;s the 1980&#39;s** and you may have your MTV and your Personal Computers, you&#39;ve got super-powers, too. Some may say &quot;greed is good&quot; and yuppies have supplanted the socially conscious hippies, you&#39;re here to stand for something! The Gauntleteer of the Bronze Age, the Neon Hero, has disappeared. New Gauntlet City needs heroes to stand up and fight, and hopefully, you can find the Gauntleteer, too.

So throw on your acid-washed jeans, your tracksuits, your ruffled shirts, or your leotard and get out there and hit them with your Buffalo Stance!

For this series, we&#39;re using the *Hearts &amp; Souls* RPG by Tim Kirk:

*Hearts &amp; Souls is a superhero role-playing game that takes you back to the comic books. It&#39;s &quot;Drive&quot; based system making the reason your character is a hero more important to his success than stats and dice. Just what is Drive? It is a way to answer the question: Why are you a hero?*

*So why would you do it? Were your parents murdered callously simply for some unscrupulous criminal to get his hands on their enormous wealth? Do you feel responsible for powers that go beyond mere mortal ken? Choose a drive, make it what matters, and be a hero.*

A seat is reserved for Sherri Stewart.

-----------------------------------
