    <description>*When you turn 60 a horrible creature emerges from the earth to take you away kicking and screaming. If you manage to kill your Harvester then it comes back next year even stronger. A game about Elder adventurers fighting for life.*

This is a brand new OSR game that&#39;s currently in beta, but the concept so intrigued me that I couldn&#39;t resist taking it for a spin! We&#39;ll build PCs and play through a scenario to see how it goes! You&#39;ll play battered and worn-down adventurers who still aren&#39;t ready to just give in to the Harvest. It&#39;s a traditional GMed OSR-style adventure game, with pretty simple rules and one big crazy concept to drive the story.

[You can get the PWYW Beta of Ripe right here.](https://technicalgrimoire.com/ripe)

Presume plenty of grimdark fantasy horror stuff, discussion of aging and obsolescence, and probably some character death. We&#39;ll use the X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and Open Door to make sure everyone has dark and melodramatic fun.
