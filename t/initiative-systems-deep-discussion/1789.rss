    <description>One of the things I really want to try to play with in my game is initiative systems.

I love AD&amp;D 2e&#39;s concept of initiative, but it is so utterly slow that it makes the game unfun.

I enjoy 3/PF/4/5 for the simplification of it, but it ultimately leads to some ridiculous results that end up not feeling great.

As I&#39;m new to it, I appreciate PBTA style combat, where it&#39;s much less about cycling through &quot;now it&#39;s my turn&quot; and much more about a flexible &quot;you can try something, but failing too much gives the GM a move&quot; but there&#39;s something lacking for me personally- the players that are not skill-focused for the contest at hand are actually better off doing *nothing*.

So what approaches do you like best to initiative?  Are there ways that let you play with changing initiative and potentially multiple turn rewards for certain conditions that isn&#39;t ridiculously broken?  Are there any PBTA-style games that play with this?  (maybe I&#39;m not familiar enough yet so even basic examples are good!)

I&#39;d also love to discuss the concept of non-combat initiatives - for instance, in a conversation that ends up being an argument, how do you navigate making sure everyone&#39;s character gets a fair shake at joining beyond just assuming &quot;make sure to shine the spotlight on all players&quot; is a highly developed GM skill?</description>

              <p>Hi, new here. I’m so happy to have found a place to talk about content creation for RPGs.</p>
<p>I run a weekly session with six 8-10 year-old Japanese kids who are new to the hobby. The game has a free-form turn order system I wrote called “ENI”. I don’t think this would work with adults but works well for me in the situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn order is decided freely. The player who describes how their PC acts or reacts takes their turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can even make an NPC take a turn, but that never happens. I guess this would be the equivalent of waiting for the right moment to attack.</p>
<p>So the GM usually starts with visual clues and taunts to show that the NPCs are not friendly, and brings them right into the action, and will keep taking turns with 5 second pauses between each turn (usually holding a hand up and counting down fingers), until the party’s survival instinct kicks in and they do something (crazy). The GM might say “You’d better do something or leave” if the players are frozen or too polite to take their turn.</p>

              <p>One initiative option that is fairly rare, but I kinda like it is the initiative checklist. I can’t remember where I found it so I just improvised an example here. I remember it had a clever solution to having multiple combatants, I just can’t remember what it was.</p>
<p>Go down the list from top to bottom, verify if you fulfil earlier tiers than your opponents, if that’s the case you go before them. If you’re at the same tier, drill down the list until you find a tier either combatant is not fulfilling.</p>

<li>You are ready for combat, weapons drawn, spell books at the ready.</li>
<li>You are aware of your opponent</li>

              <p>Other options from the old days</p>
<p><strong>Runequest</strong> had a calculated strike rank (SR) based upon your size, your dexterity, weapon length. Taller people and longer weapons had a lower SR because of their reach. In a melee round you count up from SR1 to SR12 for the 12 seconds in a round and people go at their SR. Readied missile weapons go at your DEX SR, spells go at your DEX SR+1 per point of Power put into the spell, because gathering POW takes time. It was brilliant for tactical, round by round combat. Drawing a weapon took 5SR and you could use some SR up in moving.</p>
<p><strong>Champions</strong> gave every character a speed characteristic, and that determined how many actions you could have in a 12 action round. Your actions were divided up evenly, so if you had 3 actions you would go in 4, 8 and 12. If you had 6 actions you would go in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 etc.</p>
<p>Some PbtA games (e.g. the version of <strong>Uncharted Worlds</strong> I got) don’t have round by round initiative, you just roll for the result of the combat and then GM and player narrate the relevant bits of the result depending upon how the score looked.</p>

              <p>I like the idea of declaring a number of actions in advance (a’la Burning Wheel). This reflects better the chaos of battle (sword- or word-based one) as you tend to commit to certain sequence of actions and have to live with the consequences of your choices. It’s kinda like running: you commit to a path and can’t simply reverse your trajectory on a whim.</p>
<p>I also like another system which I don’t think was mentioned in this thread. I call it initiative through recovery. The basic idea is that your initial start order is whatever you like the most, but what happens next depends on the recovery time of the action taken. Your actions are no longed taking a single slot and time is divided into much smaller parts. You can make it as simple or as complex as you feel like it too. You want the time it takes to recover from the action to depend on your skill or attribute? You can. You want all actions to take, say, 1-6 slots each? That’s fine too.</p>

<p>I tried to do a homebrew system once, in a similar way where initiative was tied to your Spotlight, and you used Spotlight to make your dice pools during your turn. Highest value goes first. Use as much or as little to make multiple actions, or ‘pass’ at any point for the next highest value, and play continues until all Spotlight is used. There was a lot more fiddly bits that didn’t quite get things off the ground, but I always liked that idea and think there’s something there conceptually anyway</p>

That would be : each round for every actor, action type phases : movement &gt; attack hidden progressive reveal : can change your mind… or not, adjudicated, short actions, narrative on another scale, can change mind until satisfied, equal speech opportunities +  <strong>simultaneous damage</strong> phase being the new thing here. Thank you !</p>
<p>I have trouble picking an option in the “action ordering” and “action planning” columns for this system. That’s because it’s unclear when to use simultaneous reveal, and to what extent you can change your mind. A clear tilting point would be useful, least it’s done on a “get on with it” basis. Maybe it’s a “… can change your mind to react” after all, with a penalty of “no planning” for abusers. As with all arbitration principles, by formulating it, you lose nothing worth keeping.</p>

Then, everyone declares their attacks; everyone rolls to hit, and then after that, damage is applied to everyone simultaneously. Even if you can take out an enemy in one hit, the enemy will get a return strike before going down.</p>
<p>In the fiction, everything is understood to happen all at once. In practice, everyone takes turns <em>declaring</em> their actions (people aren’t all talking over one another). The rules don’t give much guidance on how to handle situations where this creates unfair advantages. The spirit of <em>Traveller</em> is to fall back on the players’ sense of fair play, an implied repertoire of wargame techniques (like writing down orders in secret and then revealing them together), and when all else fails, the Referee’s common sense.</p>

<p>Super Thematic - <strong>Doctor Who RPG from Cubicle7</strong> : Initiative works depending on what you will do. It goes Talk -&gt; Act -&gt; Fight. So if you try to talk someone down you go before they will have a chance to attack you. If you try to do something clever, like close the mechanical door between you and the attackers, you get to try that before they attack, but they can still try to talk you out of it. It all fits very well with the source material.</p>

<p><strong>SPEED</strong>: Characters are ranked by Speed to define the Initiative Order. When it is unclear who should act next, the players and DM can consult this ranked list. Additionally, Initiative Order can be used to identify which player rolls for the party. Speed is mainly impacted by armor and weapons and follows Very Fast &gt; Fast &gt; Normal &gt; Slow.</p>

              <p>There are so many interesting systems in this thread. I especially like the phase-based examples like in Doctor Who or Basic D&amp;D. I think there is a lot of potential to subtly push certain genres or expectations based on what the order of events is. A while ago I was designing a game where the PCs were all dogs, so I had the idea that each combat round would start with them barking at each other (e.g. intimidation/morale check) and only then move on to attacking. I didn’t get very far with that though.</p>
<p>Another really interesting idea is described here by Patrick Stuart: <a href="https://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2018/10/physical-initiative-and-query-initiative.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2018/10/physical-initiative-and-query-initiative.html</a><br>
The first option (physical initiative) is cute but kind of gimmicky.<br>
The second option is the idea that you start with a very vague description of the ‘enemy’, and the more questions you ask about the situation, the greater your risk of “losing” initiative. So it is a push-your-luck mechanic but also simulates a person’s tendency to hesitate when they are unsure or surprised. Plus, it could sometimes produce situations where a trigger-happy PC attacks someone who wasn’t actually a threat to them. “A shape comes out of the doorway.” “Fuck! I shoot them!” “OK, you just shot the cleaning lady.” Very Coen Brothers/Tarantino.</p>

              <p>The best “Initiative” system I know is the “Plot” system in Shinobigami – a semi PvP game about ninjas living in the shadows of the modern world.</p>
<p>At the start of each round of combat, each player hides a d6 behind their hand, with the number of their choice facing up.  All players reveal their die (Their “Plot value”) simultaneously.  The plot value has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its your “initiative”, so higher plot values act first.</li>
<li>It’s the maximum “value” of ninpo (special maneuvers) you can use on your turn.</li>
<li>It’s also your fumble value, so any roll (on 2d6) that you make that is less than or equal to your plot put you in a “fumble” state where you automatically fail all rolls for the rest of the round. (Including the “dodge rolls” you make to avoid attacks.)</li>
<li>It’s ALSO your ‘position’ on the ‘battle map’; If you are on Plot 6, you need an attack with a range of at least 2 to hit a character on 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it’s a sort of “I know that you know that I know that you know” kind of decision, with lots of upsides and downsides and room for taking calculated risks.</p>

              <p>I really like the way initiative is handled in Kill Shot, a cinematic game about assassins.</p>
<p>Each side (PCs and NPCs) get a certain number of Options to use during their turn. Each Option represents an action the team takes. If the action is successful, the player / NPC can pass their turn to the next person or keep trying to push the advantage.</p>
<p>if the action is unsuccessful, the opposing side has the opportunity to interrupt and take over.  There’s a lot of back-and-forth and a bit of a push-your-luck mechanic going on.</p>
<p>It was designed to represent movies where one guy might punch another in the face repeatedly until he makes a mistake, then the defender takes control and goes on the offensive.</p>
<p>This same initiative system can be used to represent social situations too. Think of a debate where one person is talking fervently and then makes a brief pause or a mistake, and the next person interjects and steals the spotlight.</p>

<p>Conversations are fluid things, they can resist structure and rigid rules. Systems and tools can be helpful in learning and bolstering these skills. I think flexible systems can be designed to help, but I also believe we can over engineer some things too.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Spot on. I rankle when rules describe a game as “a conversation where players take turns speaking” that’s not how conversations work! Sometimes a player may be budgeted the lion’s share of the spotlight and that’s ok! Sometimes a player may get minimal time to shine and that’s also ok! Both to keep the conversation flowing naturally and allowing players who prefer to listen often and rarely act the kind of environment they want.</p>
<p>I really like your idea of keeping notes/tags for how often players have acted/participated and what skills they’ve used. I especially like it because as great a GM tool as it is, why don’t we make it an actual mechanic? Something like giving each player 2-4 “spotlight tokens” that they can cash in whenever they want to act. Could also code the tokens to specific skills/genres of action so for example a warrior would get 3 violence tokens + 1 talk token but a rogue would get 2 violence tokens + 1 sneaky token + 1 talk token. Controlling how often the tokens refresh and allowing multiple tokens to be spent at the same time for a bigger spotlight means players get to control their involvement while still having a framework that ensures a player who is quiet all night has the same impact as one that’s taking the spotlight for a majority of the time. Very barebones but just spitballing.</p>

<p>I’d also love to discuss the concept of non-combat initiatives - for instance, in a conversation that ends up being an argument, how do you navigate making sure everyone’s character gets a fair shake at joining beyond just assuming “make sure to shine the spotlight on all players” is a highly developed GM skill?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m interested to hear more approaches to this, as the only ones I can think of that don’t require lots of GM skill are those that amount to <em>everybody takes a turn before anybody takes another turn,</em> ALL the time, like Index Card RPG. This approach sounds potentially forced to me, but I’m curious to give it a try.</p>

<p>You’ve hit the nail on the head, which is that “initiative systems”, in a larger sense, are just a subset of various ways to order the conversation at the table and to make sure that everyone gets a chance to participate.</p>
<p>In other words, people focus on the “who goes first?” question when talking about initiative, but that’s only because we’re already starting with the assumption that everyone will get a fair chance to act.</p>
<p>The more basic, fundamental purpose is to <em>guarantee everyone a fair chance to participate</em>, and to organize that in some way we can understand, follow, and trust.</p>
<p>In D&amp;D, for instance, it’s much more important to maintain the <em>action economy</em> than it is to maintain the orders of actions (try fooling around with those and you’ll quickly see!).</p>
<p>Really, the key elements of an “initiative systems” are to make sure that a) we know when someone can or has to stop talking, and b) who talks next.</p>
<p>We do this fluidly and intuitively in conversation, and in most PbtA games, but the downsides are that the loudest people can sometimes predominate, that it’s easy to upset the balance (e.g. forgetting to give some people the opportunity to speak at all), and that having to negotiate that can sometimes be slower than just having a routine method.</p>
<p>I’m quite curious and excited about different models for “initiative” that might pop up in the RPG world, and finding ways to adapt them from general use to combat situations, or from combat rules to general “free” play.</p>
<p>The good old “take turns clockwise around the table” is pretty hard to beat, in some ways, but it also has all kinds of downsides (like a lack of interactivity - when you know it’s not your turn for the next 10 minutes, it’s easy to check out altogether, for example).</p>
