    <description>![Writer&#39;s%20Retreat|434x500](upload://izDHI1pnpyRNb3HmyVwHuKWFtds.jpeg) 

This is a one-shot Trophy game with a playset of my own. (Trophy is found in Codex: Dark 2). 
I will run it on [date=2019-03-23 time=20:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;] → [date=2019-03-23 time=23:30:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LZaxA7ldchRC5p4pOmc


You are all aspiring writers, looking forward to going to a writer&#39;s retreat with the reclusive master of horror, Esteban del Rey, author of Shadow in the Rain, Ember Birds, Skeleton Tree, They Walk Beneath and Shattered. You have heard strange rumors about these retreats in the remote woodlands of Maine, but each of you is going despite the warnings for their own reasons and ambitions. 

Be advised that Trophy is a horror game based on Cthulhu Dark. It is a game about people ending up mad, or dead, or worse. 

The X-Card safety tool will be on the table, as will be lines and veils. For more information on the Gauntlet&#39;s safety tools, please refer to our Inclusivity Policy on the website (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html ). 

The game is scheduled for 3-4 hours.</description>
