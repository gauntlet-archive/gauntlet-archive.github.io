    <title>Blog comment integration with Discourse</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/blog-comment-integration-with-discourse/3327</link>
    <description>I have set up Discourse integration with the Gauntlet Blog. So now when a blog entry is first visited a topic for the blog comments will be generated in the #gauntlet-community:blog-comments category. This will mean that over time there might be some &quot;old news&quot; posts showing up in your list of New/Unread topics. I apologize for the &quot;spam&quot; - but it is just how it will be for a while.</description>

              <p>I did a bit of tweaking and on the upside now these entries won’t show up in the Latest or Unread listings, but will show up in New.</p>
