    <title>Dave Arneson Game Day - October 1st</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/dave-arneson-game-day-october-1st/8418</link>
    <description>Tomorrow is the start of Blackmoor Week - which ends on October 1st with Dave Arneson Game day! In general people are encouraged to learn more about the inventor of our hobby, and perhaps get something &quot;old school&quot; to the table. 
Personally I encourage folks to check out the Secrets of Blackmoor documentary https://www.secretsofblackmoor.com/ 
Maybe swing by https://blackmoor.mystara.net/ or try and find a copy of *Champions of ZED* -- a really cool game based on extensive research that attempted to synergize the vision and work of both Arneson and Gygax. 

For my bit, each year for Blackmoor Week I run our only site-wide sale. Everything on the *Compose Dream Games RPG Marketplace* is **20% off**. Just use coupon code &quot;Arneson&quot; on the shopping cart page.

              <p>Sure is! And those look like fun house rules, purely 2d6 based.</p>
<p>And having a read of them has reminded me that I don’t actually have a morale/reaction rules in my <a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/dungeon-unleashed" rel="nofollow noopener">Dungeons Unleashed!</a> rules . . . I’ll have to included that in my next revision.<br>
(Ok, there is morale stuff for large units in the Battle System appendix, but I think a general rule is needed too.)</p>
