    <title>What piece of media do you wish was an RPG?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/what-piece-of-media-do-you-wish-was-an-rpg/1308</link>
    <description>Most of the time when I start designing a game it’s right after experiencing a piece of media and as a result of me going “wow, I’d love to recreate that experience.”

What experience would you recreate if you could, in game form? Try to be specific. Also, feel free to ignore the “if you could part” - let’s not get hung up on how we’d actually go about designing it (unless you want to in a reply thread or maybe in the game design section of the forum).

For my part, I’m currently working on a fantasy horror game, which is way out of my comfort zone, after I was inspired by the Prince of Nothing / Aspect Emperor series by R. Scott Bakker. 

I really wanted a game that had mechanics that gave me clear goal posts to hit and specific ways my character might realistically change when confronted with existential horror in a fantasy setting (I know lots of games already deal with this - trust me this will be different and pretty darn cool).</description>

A heist game with rules about reality layers and elements from the player’s subconscious emerging as physical threats when they fail… that would be neat.<br>

<p>There’s a game called <em>Fight! The Fighting Game RPG</em> which, if I remember, has some rules for modelling side scrolling beat 'em ups. It’s primarily designed to emulate the fighting game genre, but even if I’m remembering wrong and it <em>doesn’t</em> include rules for beat 'em ups then it would be a pretty easy hack to make them work.</p>

              <p>Well, the post-apocalyptic feel I get from these games is more a collapse of society than a bomb or earthquake or whatever. It’s like society has broken down to such an extent that everything’s fallen apart, rather than there being a singular cataclysm.</p>
<p>Like the first <em>Mad Max</em>. The world there seems to be ours, just with more gangs and less law. That’s the kind of thing I mean.</p>
<p>Anyway, I look forward to your game!</p>

<p>Ha! That’s my idea for a system I was writing. But not necessarily post-apocalyptic, tho. I’m playtesting some of it next month. Fingers crossed!</p>

              <p>I feel like there’s a lot of potential for exploration in the worlds of 80s/90s side-scrolling beat-em-ups. There’s an almost post-apocalyptic setting implied in many of them, where social disorder has led to a societal collapse. You see this in <em>Double Dragon</em>, for example, when you leave the urban environments and there’s a sort of unrecognisable lawless wasteland. Not that the cities seem to benefit from the rule of law!</p>
<p>You don’t get to see much of those worlds in the games themselves with their sharp focus on walking right and beating up punks, but I think there’s some fun to be had there.</p>
<p>I suppose there’s some crossover with cyberpunk, but the beat-em-ups tend to be less futuristic and less obsessed with technology, sort of like a 1989 that never was.</p>
<p>I don’t know how it would work mechanically. The obvious route is something like <em>Feng Shui</em> with elaborate martial arts mechanics, but part of me thinks it’s worth exploring a more abstract approach to combat. Then again, fistfighting is probably the central transaction of the genre, so you would probably want to emphasise that in play.</p>
