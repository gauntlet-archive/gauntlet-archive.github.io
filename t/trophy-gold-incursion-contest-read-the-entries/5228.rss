    <title>Trophy Gold Incursion Contest - Read the Entries!</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/trophy-gold-incursion-contest-read-the-entries/5228</link>
    <description>*UPDATE 2: We have changed the text of the original post to reflect that, while there is no central public folder for the entries, participants are free to make their entries available as links in the replies to this post.

*UPDATE 1: Someone brought up the good point that we didn’t make it clear the contest entries would be made public. I think I just took for granted people understood that would be the case based off past contests and prior discussions. I went ahead and took down the folder link. Jesse and I will continue judging the entries until we decide how and whether we want to make them public. I put together this contest as a fun way to celebrate people’s work, and so obviously I apologize to the contest entrants in the most unequivocal terms if someone takes anything but a positive feeling from this.*


The submission deadline for the Trophy Gold incursion contest has passed. We received an astonishing 65 entries!

The next step for the contest is for @jesseross and I to read each entry and discuss them. We will announce the winner and runners-up on a special episode of The Trophy Podcast to be released sometime in early to mid-June. 

Some rules for this thread:

1. Keep it positive. This contest was meant to be a fun, creative exercise. Being unnecessarily harsh or critical isn’t called for in this space. If you have a criticism of a particular piece, consider framing it as a question, such as: “A question I have about this incursion is why did the author do XYZ in Set Q?”

2. If you participated in the contest, feel free to identify yourself and include a link to your entry. The judges will not be reading this thread. This is a space where you can discuss the contest freely. You might also want to join the Trophy Discord, where the contest results will be discussed in the #gold-incursions channel. 

3. If you don’t see your entry in the list below, email us. Your entry may have gotten lost in the Google Drive shuffle, or your submission email went to spam.

With all that said, here is the list of incursions:

              <p>Realizing that I never added the link to my incursion once the folder was closed.</p>
<p>The incursion is “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHSHipYVUH2BsDZWNtlRiiEMVoW8QGsixa59dNqTOMY/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">The Mithril Mines of Airgead Canyon</a>”.</p>
<p>In some ways the incursion is “Trophy Lite” with the horror turned down, but a GM could easily turn up the horror and suspense if they wanted to.</p>
<p><em>Airgead Canyon is a very deep canyon about one day’s travel from the nearest town. At the bottom of the canion lies an old and abandoned Mithril Mine reported to be filled with mithril ripe for the taking. The theme is Hubris and it’s designed as a one-shot intro incursion for new Trophy Gold players that plays on some classic RPG tropes.</em></p>

<p>Thank you to everyone that entered, I’ve just finished reading Jason’s summary Twitter thread. So many creative ideas, whilst Jason was positive about every Incursion, there are several standout to me and I am intrigued to find out who the winner is.</p>
<p>My entry was: Labyrinth of the Mind. Whilst I enjoyed writing the Incursion, I didn’t want to share, since after reading a summary of the other entries, I feel mine needs way more work; I’m sure some others feel the same about their entry.

<p>I also wanted to add, that I am brand new to both this community, writing Incursions, and tabletop RPGs in general.  I have been absolutely floored by how supportive everyone has been as theoretical “competitors” in this contest and how excited everyone is for each other’s ideas and writing.  Its a really unique and special community!  Well done everyone!</p>

              <p>My first incursion, <a href="https://tinyurl.com/oathandfolly" rel="nofollow noopener">Oath and Folly</a>, set in a desert.  Inspired by Napoleon’s failed 1798 incursion to Egypt, but set a bit more in a swords and sorcery era.</p>
<p>Both a lot of fun and a lot of work to write, but that hearty mélange of work and fun is where the good stuff arises.</p>
<p>I adapted Trophy’s six characteristics in the Bestiary a bit.  The six characteristics of monsters are based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.  They are still behaviors, but are couched in a stratification of needs.  Generally speaking they conform to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Biological (food, drink)</li>
<li>Biological (shelter)</li>
<li>Safety (tasks, security)</li>
<li>Belonging (packs, orders, or family)</li>
<li>Esteem (status, recognition, freedom)</li>
<li>Self-actualization (individual needs or drives)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some pack or hive monsters and those lacking sentience may not have individual needs.</p>

It’s a race across a dry seabed and through a dead coral reef maze to recover treasures from a sunken ship that now sits in a vast salt-encrusted expanse.</p>
<p>It was hard to stay under the 5000 word limit because I had so many ideas. In the end, I decided it was easier to go the old school route of saying characters aren’t omniscient and sometimes things are just weird, so it isn’t necessary to provide an explanation for everything. I know why everything is there, but that knowledge isn’t needed by the treasure-hunters as they explore the incursion. They can theorize their own explanations or investigate further on their own if they can’t live without knowing.</p>

The concept for it comes from the visual art I used to do more regularly - mostly I just filled it with some of my favorite imagery. My intention was to present an incursion as possibly more of a pilgrimage in pursuit of knowledge. I also wanted to make the treasure hunters aware of being outsiders to a living culture who may not accept them and isn’t there to be conquered.  Hopefully its an interesting variation on Gold incursions. Let me know what you think. -Gabriel</p>

              <p>Thank you to Jesse and Jason for creating and publishing Trophy Gold! Thank you to the Gauntlet community for being a fine community of people where things like this happen. And THANK YOU to all who did the hard work of getting your ideas onto the page and putting your submissions out there to be judged. It is no small feat and in doing so you are all winning! And one final extra appreciation to all of you who were willing to post your incursions here for the rest of us to admire, learn from, and maybe to play. THANK YOU, ALL!</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I wrote Léthé IV. It was inspired by a short Mothership adventure I wrote some times ago. It’s about a graveyard planet, the theme is “Oblivion”.</p>
