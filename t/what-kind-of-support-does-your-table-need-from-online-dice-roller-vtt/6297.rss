I just spent the day working on [Togetherness Table](https://www.1kfa.com/table) and with the new year upon us I thought I would ask this question again to a wide audience.

I&#39;m [working on](https://github.com/sjbrown/togetherness) an Open Source dice-roller / Virtual Tabletop, with the intent to make something really easy to hack.  I don&#39;t think I want to get into video chat (Jitsi, Zoom, etc will always do it better), and so far I haven&#39;t done much in the way in terms of battle maps (I just don&#39;t tend to play those kinds of games).  I was thinking dynamic character sheets might be useful - not just text-form-filling, but a dynamic sheet that has dice rolls built into it, or when you get 2-6 in Dungeon World, it automatically adds an XP.

But I think y&#39;all might have even better ideas than that.  Hit me up with all your creativity, please!

Or just say hi, take a look at the tool and lemme know what you think.

<p>For asynchronous play (PbF or PbM) I’ve seen on “Roll for your party” a counter that states the number of operations on the page. That certifies the roll you present has not been engineered. Personally, I don’t need the feature because I play in a trust environment. But it could bring trust where it is needed.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry ! I see you did more than that with the ACTIVITY LOG ! Brilliant.<br>
Some strangeness there, however : the log reveals that every dice rolled is in fact being rolled twice. I can live with it.</p>

Another thing I forgot to mention, I’ve also added an (experimental) feature for some snap-to “mats”. Right now there’s a Chessboard and some Grid Paper.</p>
<p>I’m still playing around how “mats” should work, conceptually, so there might be big changes, or I might scrap the feature and start over.</p>

I know that you’re aware of this issue. But considering the state of the roller when we first started using it, we’ve seen huge improvements.<br>

<p>I had some time tonight to do one of the ones I’ve been personally looking forward to: <strong>Image Dice</strong>. This option lets you use images as the faces of the dice <em>and</em> give them values that are used in the Dynamic Trays.</p>

<p>That’s not entirely true! If the die is still on the page, you can “clone” it. (I asked about this before!)</p>

<p>Ah.  So there’s a couple things you could do for that specific numbering scheme. It’s a bit tedious, but you could go to the “User-Defined” dice section and input all the symbols, from “00”, “01”, …, “99”.  Or you could make a “tens” die to use alongside a regular d10 by inputting the ten symbols “00”, “01”, …, “10”.</p>

<p>If you were in multiplayer, right now there will be inconsistent results. The multiplayer bugfix effort is underway, but it will still take time.  So I expect sometimes reloading will sync up properly, but sometimes it will get into a weird state.</p>

<p>Various fixes and updates today!  Finished up work on the “Activity Log” which tells you who did what, when.  It can be opened by clicking the player menu on the right side.</p>
<p>Also, the “special dice” that would let you make dice with one-character-long dice symbols has been replaced by “User-Defined Dice” that let’s you specify multi-character symbols, one per line, and even lets you add blank faces.</p>
<p>A couple superficial bugfixes also.</p>

<p>Do you think drag-select would feel better if just covering the midpoint of an object is what included it in the selection? (Rather than now - covering the whole object)</p>
<p>I don’t know if “fix” is the best name. Clicking “fix” lets you alter the size of a tray and lets you drag objects out of it.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks for all the thorough and considerate answers. This tool is only getting better and better! Very exciting stuff.</p>
<p>I do think that the midpoint of an object is more like how other drag-select operations work. (Certainly how Windows works, anyway.) And it would make it easier to select things that are near the edge of the screen (right now, when a die pops up in the top left, for example, it’s almost impossible to drag-select it, unless you make sure your “drag area” is exactly flush with the edge of the screen).</p>
<p>As for “fix”: so the “fix” button is identical to double-clicking the dynamic tray? I see. Maybe “select” or “adjust” would be better? (I had assumed “fix” might mean to make the tray “locked in place”, kind of the opposite of what you’re saying here.)</p>

              <p>Broadly replying to y’all about the multiplayer issues: thanks again for giving it a try and reporting your findings.  It’s keeping me up at night.  I could either try to reproduce and root-out each reported behaviour, or I could boil the ocean and rebuild the whole multiplayer feature from the ground up using… maybe Operational Transforms as the design…</p>
<p>Still pondering.  Open to suggestions.  If anyone knows anyone who has done multiplayer games or collaborative document editing, I’d love to hear advice.</p>
