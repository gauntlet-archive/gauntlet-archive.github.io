<p>I just read a very apropos article from another awesome Sean (Sean McCoy dev of Mothership RPG, which I‚Äôm getting into to scratch that survival horror sci-fi itch) : <a href="http://www.failuretolerated.com/leveling-down" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.failuretolerated.com/leveling-down </a></p>
<p>In particular, I REALLY like the concept of exchanging stress for XP during downtime. As he says, ‚Äútaking the word ‚ÄòExperience‚Äô pretty literally.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh WOW, this is a fantastic resource. And I‚Äôm very enamored with the idea of Remove Stress as a way to gain XP. That‚Äôs deliciously elegant design.</p>
<p>Speaking of Stress:</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still in early playtesting, but so far I‚Äôve found that characters suffer on average 1.5 Stress per session. A big part of this is the fact that the players choose from a list of consequences for all but a 6-, so they can balance taking hits with other Bad Stuff.</p>
<p>This average may change, as I‚Äôve asked my players to switch to different characters; the previous crew had two Military characters, who were good at ‚Äòviolence-without-getting-hurt-in-return‚Äô.</p>
<p>That said, my first inclination is along the same lines as Deckard‚Äôs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, armor could act as an extra box or two before the player gets into the harm track and then need replacement armor after use? This would keep those same players always scrounging for more armor.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That certainly feels right. Body harm is a lot more prevalent than Heart or Mind stress, but you can have body armor that can soak Body damage. I‚Äôve already been leaning towards it, as evidenced by the Productive Origin being able to clear stress on assets rather than on themselves when they Rest and Recover.</p>

</aside>
<p>In a BitD adjacent way,  I could also see certain careers opening up other kinds of limited use ‚Äúspecial armor‚Äù through level advances (psionic getting Mental Defenses is the most obvious, but something akin to Bravery from the Fanatic career‚Ä¶ Although these kinds of things may prompt weird semantic arguments in some groups). What I like about those is the niche protection and implicit spotlight sharing: ‚ÄúNormally I‚Äôm not the toughest, but if we need a champion to duel the psychic space worm, its my time to shine.‚Äù</p>
<p>While I‚Äôve got you on the line so to speak, how do you envision Patch-Up working with Stresses? As written at the moment they don‚Äôt seem to fit together cleanly. Like they don‚Äôt share the same DNA. Is it intended that on a success the Stress is simply ignored for the purposes of not gaining more stress by acting against the narratively imposed limitations of the Stress. I.e. a broken leg is still broken, but after a successful Patch-Up roll the character can run on it, at least for now‚Ä¶ Seems like another checkbox might be nice to keep track of that on the character sheet. Something like ‚Äúmended‚Äù or ‚Äúpatched‚Äù.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, for the moment Patch-Up and the Stress system don‚Äôt quite mesh as well as they should, mostly since the whole harm mechanics were still very early when I wrote Patch Up. I need to reword that Career Move anyway.</p>
<p>As you noted, there‚Äôs a concept that I bring up in the Harm rules (but didn‚Äôt expand upon) called ‚ÄúPushing‚Äù. When you are limited by your own Stress or Burden, you can suffer Stress to ignore it. Patch-Up allows you to ignore Pushing and act freely.</p>
<p>I imagine they‚Äôll be playing catch-up with each other for the next while as they come closer together.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôd greatly appreciate feedback on this new version of the Academic career Move. This is a tough one to get right, because the ‚ÄúAcademic‚Äù sci-fi trope is (ironically) both very wide in subject matter, and very focused in tone and methodology.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PATCH UP ‚Äì Academic Move</strong></p>
<p>When you treat a living subject or reprogram an open system, <strong>Roll+Intellect.</strong><br>
When you rewire, calibrate, or overclock a piece of technology, <strong>Roll+Expertise.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On a 10+</strong> , choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Diagnostic:</strong> Discover what‚Äôs hurting, draining, or otherwise afflicting the subject.</li>
<li>
<strong>Boost:</strong> Choose a limit to the subject‚Äôs actions. Temporarily ignore that limitation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lock:</strong> Choose a behavior. The subject is temporarily unable to behave that way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On a 7-9</strong> , choose one (as a 10+ result), but you‚Äôll have to cause harm to the subject, suffer harm yourself, and/or sacrifice resources to get results.</p>
<p><strong>On a 6-,</strong> the situation, procedure, or subject becomes incredibly volatile.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Diagnostic</strong> is pretty straight forward, and is there as a better version of Seek the Truth, but only for health assessment. See: every doctor, biologist, and engineer on every sci-fi show. Spouting exposition of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with X‚Äù is like 90% of their job.</p>
<p>I wanted to give a certain amount of creative leeway with the the Boost and Lock.</p>
<p><strong>Boost</strong> is the ‚Äúmake things work again‚Äù. It can be used to tinker with a gun to punch through armor with its next shot (ignore limitation: can‚Äôt pierce heavy armor), coax a shorted out vehicle engine to start up (ignore limitation: overloaded), or get a soldier on their feet (ignore limitation: debilitating injuries).</p>
<p><strong>Lock</strong> can sedate people (unable to stay awake), prevent overloads (unable to gain more charge), or just lock out people from systems (unable to accept new users). I worry it might be a bit too open to abuse, especially when dealing with living beings (‚Äúunable to continue breathing‚Äù), but the necessary fictional positioning (treating, programming, calibrating) will hopefully act as a natural deterrent. Still, the expanded rules will probably highlight this issue, and advise the GM to set certain expectations of ‚Äúfair play‚Äù and making a fun story. Which applies to the whole game, really, since player authorship means everything is at least somewhat open to abuse.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also I am <em>totally</em> not married to the name ‚ÄúPatch Up‚Äù. If anything, it breaks the ‚Äúone word verb‚Äù naming convention I‚Äôve got going on.

<p>The could be a Clandestine Academic Hacker if they wanted to really specialize‚Ä¶ but depending on their initial Maneuver roll, I‚Äôd say on a 10+ they are in the system and no one is the wiser: they do it (maybe a seek the truth roll if it is a very secure system or a situation with a lot of narrative pressure / implications) . 7-9 : its going to be a Race the Clock follow up for sure.</p>

<p>I feel you. This is a tough nut. I understand why they are grouped together. 5 stats, an unique combination of 2 for each career, 10 careers. But, do we want all our Dr. Bashirs to be Chief O‚ÄôBriens?  I mean one is Academic+Personality and the other is Academic+Industrial‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I guess it seems to me that these niches are usually well separated in fiction and in games (the Cleric and the Artificer‚Ä¶ with maybe an edge case or two, I‚Äôm looking at you Forge Domain Cleric) or at least they require a solid investment of chargen resources (i.e. skill points, multi-classing, etc) to combine. Like if the industrial career was the sole domain of building and repairing machines and Academic was the advanced chemistry and biology of living bodies and bio-tech. The line blurs though in sci-fi.</p>
<p>This is off the cuff and not well worded, but something like -<br>
<strong>SCIENCE!</strong><br>
When you study, analyze or investigate an anomaly, <strong>Roll+Intellect.</strong><br>
When you manipulate the fundamental building blocks of the universe, <strong>Roll+Expertise.</strong><br>
Then have it play like Read a Sitch? Ask differing number of questions from a list and take +1 forward on the answers? So they then make a Race the Clock to provide medical aid to someone, but they‚Äôll be doing it with a significant advantage due to the +1?  Or since we have the advantage mechanism: Take advantage when acting on the answers‚Ä¶</p>
<p>EDIT: That might be too generic though- a common player question might be: How do I just give this guy some simple first aid?! Maybe a <strong>10+</strong> is a success. You do it. You gain significant information or apply your expert knowledge to the problem. Choose one: diagnostic, boost, lock (as above, but reworded to be less techy and more general science-y?) <strong>On a 7-9,</strong> Things just got more complicated, but you‚Äôve got a good idea for what to do next. Take advantage on dealing with the consequences. <strong>6-,</strong> an unforeseen consequence catches you off guard. Prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>Might require taking another look at Industrial to balance it out.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ah, this is a very interesting topic that comes up a lot in PbtA. Allowing characters the freedom to act vs niche protection.</p>
<p>The Core Moves are written as situational Moves. It‚Äôs less about ‚Äúwhat‚Äù you want to do (boost a computer‚Äôs power) and more ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you want to do it (do it before time runs out, do it to discover a way forward, do it to brain-burn the enemy hacker). ‚ÄúBoosting the power‚Äù isn‚Äôt the end goal in that case, but rather the means you use to achieve a goal (i.e.: Roll + Intellect).</p>
<p>Basically, non-Academics boost computers, administer drugs, re-calibrate machinery in order to solve immediate problems.<br>
Academics do those things to create and control scenarios, and set up long-term advantageous situations.</p>
<p>The niche protection of Careers over Core Moves is two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Predictable results:</strong> While both an Academic and non-Academic can boost a power relay or drug a guard, the Academic has more leeway and creative interpretation with their Move. In the same way that anyone can pilot a ship, but an Explorer can pull off amazing stunts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Better results:</strong> The Core Moves have harsher and more frequent costs. Even at the highest level of success, it usually costs <em>something</em> to get the job done. Career Moves are professional versions of the amateur fumbling. A 10+ on a Career Move means full success at least, if not a little bonus on top. Anyone can try to sneak into somewhere, but the Clandestine can slip in <em>and</em> scan the area or pick up a bit of bonus loot.</li>

          <p>Took a bit of time off before re-evaluating the new Academic Move, taking the feedback into account of course.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, making an ‚ÄòAcademic‚Äô move is hard because it covers such a wide spectrum of non-overlapping disciplines. And while I still kinda like Patch-Up/Operate, I feel that it doesn‚Äôt quite express what Academic career should be.</p>
<p>So I went back to the drawing board and considered three big things:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does ‚ÄúAcademic‚Äù mean in a sci-fi context when it <em>isn‚Äôt</em> a doctor? That was a big issue, because the ‚Äòobvious‚Äô solution is to pattern it off Julian Bashir and Simon Tam.</li>
<li>What do the various scientific fields have in common? Where do their methods, drives, or ways of thinking overlap?</li>
<li>What does this Move provide to the other careers? How does it help other Moves?</li>
</ul>
<p>I ended up finding my inspiration in <a href="https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Eisenhorn_(Novel_Series)" rel="nofollow noopener">Dan Abnett‚Äôs Eisenhorn</a> (omnibus edition), a fantastic read that I strongly recommend. In it, one of the titular character‚Äôs associates is Uber Aemos, a ‚ÄúSavant‚Äù. Basically a font of knowledge, history, logic, translation, and observation. Aemos really feels like a ‚Äòpure‚Äô Academic, both literally and in UW terms.</p>
<p>From there I looked at the ‚ÄúExpertise‚Äù mirror of that Intellect. Expertise is hands-on, dirt-under-the-fingernails science, all about objects, tech, terrain. It got me thinking of shell casings, ballistics, autopsies, ruins, etc. Which brought me to archaeologists (Indiana Jones) and crime scene investigations (Sherlock Holmes), and cemented the idea.</p>
<p>The overlap between various scientific fields is the ability to study and analyze. Sounds obvious, but making that into a Move was tricky.</p>
<p>So here it is:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>STUDY ‚Äì <em>Academic Move</em></strong></p>
<p>When you to make an assessment from research, samples, or scans, <strong>Roll+Intellect.</strong><br>
When you piece together clues from debris, remains, or markings, <strong>Roll+Expertise.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On a 10+</strong> , choose an inquiry. The GM will prompt you to share your findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Diagnosis:</strong> What‚Äôs currently wrong with this, and how to deal with it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sequencing:</strong> The history or chain of events that happened here.</li>
<li>
<strong>Provenance:</strong> Where did this originate? What was the source or cause?</li>
<li>
<strong>Extrapolation:</strong> Which way is this going? What can be expected next?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On a 7-9</strong> , choose an inquiry (as a 10+ result), but the GM gets to add an unfortunate detail, complication, hook, or twist to your findings.</p>
<p><strong>On a 6-,</strong> the situation, subject, or results prove to be quite volatile.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that‚Äôs what the Academic offers to other careers: the ability to learn about something in order to make better decisions. Military Academics will use it to predict troop movements. Academic Explorers can delve into the history of alien ruins, or find out what kind of creature left these tracks. Clandestine Academics can track down murderers, etc.</p>
<p>I think this may be the way to go. This way healing/medicine can be a Skill of the Academic (as characters level up and specialize) while repairs and calibrations remain the purview of the Industrial (though Industrial Academics still make the best repairs because they can assess/diagnose a problem, <em>and</em> solve it efficiently.)</p>

          <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/seangomes">@SeanGomes</a>, While I like this and the other revised moves, I feel like my group will always check their stats and then do whichever is more likely to be successful if the choice of stat does not impact the narrative results at all.</p>
<p>For example, a move like Defy Danger (while itself flawed) at least gives a different narrative prompt for the results based on the way the danger is defied (dodged mediocre then perhaps you rolled towards a ledge, attempting to defy the damage by shielding yourself didn‚Äôt go great, then maybe you are partially buried under debris, etc.)</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt really see a case being made for one approach over another in this move as the results are the same whether a player uses Intellect or Expertise.</p>
<p>My players often just pick their stat they were best with over and over if the result would not have different narrative impacts. How do you get around this when the moves are written in this way?</p>

          <p>That‚Äôs a really good point, and something I‚Äôve been thinking about generally. Usually I‚Äôve tried to make the two stats have different ‚Äúpoints of interaction‚Äù. Even though they both ostensibly have the same <em>results</em>, the <em>activity</em> itself varies enough that it should be obvious which one is being called.</p>
<p>That said, some of the splits are less obvious than others.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Academic</strong> is admittedly interchangeable: Research or Investigation</li>
<li>
<strong>Advocate</strong> is also kinda same-y: Emotions or Logic</li>
<li>
<strong>Clandestine</strong> is pretty good: Sneaking and Hacking.</li>
<li>
<strong>Commercial</strong> is also very distinct: People or Stuff</li>
<li>
<strong>Explorer</strong> is very different: Parkour or Vehicle Stunt</li>
<li>
<strong>Industrial</strong> is not too bad: Small Gadget or Big Construction</li>
<li>
<strong>Military</strong> is solid (with a bit of guidance): Up Close or Long Range</li>
<li>
<strong>Personality</strong> is a little shaky: Charm vs Intimidation</li>
<li>
<strong>Scoundrel</strong> is fairly distinct: Pickpocket vs Scam</li>
<li>
<strong>Psionic</strong> difference is kinda philosophical: Telepathy or Telekinesis</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those, I feel Academic, Advocate, and maybe Personality could use another pass to make them more discrete. I‚Äôm open to suggestions for more obvious splits, either by subject, action, or philosophy. Like maybe‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Study+Intellect</strong> subjects are organic life and cultural relics. (Medicine, anthropology, chemistry, etc)<br>
<strong>Study+Expertise</strong> subjects are locations and inanimate objects. (Forensics, tracking, geology, etc)</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>That said!</strong></em></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs entirely bad that a character chooses <em>how</em> they approach a situation based on their stats. Stats are meant to represent the characters‚Äô strengths, so it‚Äôs only natural they would try to leverage them. Take Military: their decision to rush the enemy or take cover and pick them off depends on their aptitudes as well as the fictional positioning.</p>

          <p>I ended up taking a bit of time to revisit the Careers, and tightened up the three careers that weren‚Äôt quite distinct enough for my tastes. Hopefully this will lead to less overlap, and less uncertainty about which stat applies to which action.</p>

          <p>Hey Sean!  Long time fan from ye olde G+ community.  I ran the <a href="https://reignofterra.obsidianportal.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reign of Terra</a> campaign, which remains some of my fondest memories!  I had no idea UW2 is under development after we were scattered to the four winds.  Glad to see that you‚Äôve picked up the pen again and will be following its development closely!  Hopefully I‚Äôll get around to running games again so I can playtest this!</p>

<p>Hi folks. Sorry about the long periods of silence. It‚Äôs been a hell of a month, lots of personal stuff (mostly bad, a few bright moments).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm happy to report that UW2 is now at a mostly playable stage, enough so that I can <em>feel</em> what it wants to be when playtesting. That‚Äôs always a huge boon to a designer, when a system or component  makes itself known.<br>
Several systems have gone through multiple iterations because of this, including core Moves, career Moves, and the Downtime system. I‚Äôve also closed in on the shape of advancement/XP, and on how I‚Äôll be handing gear. It‚Äôs all coming together quite nicely, at a slow but steady pace.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm hoping to have new, updated Alpha documents soon, so I can share all this stuff with you. For the moment it‚Äôs kinda the digital equivalent of notes scribbled on cocktail napkins. But it works! And it‚Äôs fun! And I‚Äôm looking forward to writing the meat of the system.</p>
<p>At some point in the not-too-distant future I‚Äôm going to have to run playtests with folks who aren‚Äôt part of my weekly gaming group, to get a set of fresh eyes on the system. And I‚Äôd love to. Sadly, these days, I have no idea <em>how</em> to organize a Random-Person-On-The-Internet rp session. Or where to look. Also possibly running a play-by-post? Problems for Future Sean.</p>
<p>Anywho, just dropping in with a project update, and hoping you‚Äôre all doing well.</p>
<p>Also: Good to see you <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/andante">@andante</a>! Glad you joined, sorry I didn‚Äôt reply right away. Always good to see folks from The G+ That Was, reminder of The Before Times.</p>
