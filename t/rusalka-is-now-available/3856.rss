    <description>Nick Wedig&#39;s game Rusałka is super great and I love it: https://nickwedig.itch.io/rusalka (If you want to buy it as a deck of cards, it is also available on DTRPG: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273096/Rusalka). This is a very focused monkey&#39;s paw of a game - you will play people who really need things, and you will also play the cruel supernatural monsters who will give them precisely what they ask for.</description>
