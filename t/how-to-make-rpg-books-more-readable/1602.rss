    <title>How To Make RPG Books More Readable?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/how-to-make-rpg-books-more-readable/1602</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been reading a lot of roleplaying game books lately, for work and for this project:

http://www.juhanapettersson.com/category/a-game-per-year/

To be blunt, many of the books are a slog.

**Naturally, I&#39;d like my own games to be readable, so I was wondering what makes an rpg book more readable to you? What rpgs are fun and easy to read? Do you read rpg books cover to cover or in some other way?**</description>

              <p>I suspect that this is done so that it is harder to copy.  As mechanics are not copyrightable, mixing them in with copywritable material makes reimplementing them more of a chore.  Then again, maybe that’s just me being paranoid.</p>

              <p>Yep! Also, using a piece of jargon unique to your game allows you to utilize it as a macro. You see this a lot in CCGs, where a keyword takes the place of rules text. E.g., instead of saying “this creature can immediately attack when played, instead of having to wait a turn”, you give it the Haste keyword.</p>
<p>Not only does this save space, but it now makes it easier for rules to interact with that element. You can say things like “if this creature has haste” or “give this creature haste” or “search your deck for a creature with haste”.</p>
<p>On the flipside, jargon does decrease readability in other aspects, so it’s a trade-off. One example I like here is how Blades in the Dark defines something, e.g., a Fortune Roll, and then references that terminology elsewhere, i.e., “if X, you might make a Fortune Roll”.</p>

              <p>This is an interesting point, and directly relevant to readability! I’ve been reading a lot of 70’s rpgs lately and you really notice that established terminology doesn’t exist yet. This means that they have to spend a lot of words explaining things that now have standard expressions. One is about dice, the 1d6, 3d4+2 etc convention. If you don’t have shorthand, that becomes tedious very fast: “Take three of the pyramid-shaped dice with numbers ranging from one to four and roll them, adding the results together and then adding an additional modifier of 2…”</p>

              <p>I like that the post winds up acknowledging that you do need a level of compromise, because the thing about “natural language” is that it’s also ambiguous, and too much of it can make rules unreadably muddy. We can have mechanics like drawing cards and rolling dice because those words have been given universal meanings by popular games.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to figure out what “draw a card” means if nobody’s taught you how card games work. Do you sketch it? What about having a hand of cards?</p>
<p>I think what I’d add to this post is that in order to make rules that people broadly understand, you have to rely on widely-understood jargon, and should only lean into niche jargon when it’s absolutely necessary in order to identify a specific rules construct in your game.</p>

              <p>This was interesting. I think I also need to get my hands on the games mentioned in that post. I’ve struggled a lot with similar issues, of trying to break through the aesthetics of game mechanics to the social interaction of roleplaying. In the post, the writer says they don’t want to jettison D&amp;D entirely, and I get that. However, I did end up jettisoning traditional mechanics entirely in my own Chernobyl, Mon Amour because they felt so counterproductive in terms of the experience I was after.</p>

              <p>For me, the problem is less the quality of the fiction, more the big block of text I’m wading past to get to the game itself and understand what it’s like. For me, fiction matters less because you can build a good story around any game if you try hard enough. (We joke about the whole “d&amp;d can do anything” idea, but there’s people who really can make it do anything!) I’m more interested in understanding how the game engages and promotes particular fiction. So, having swathes of fiction in an RPG book doesn’t really help me.</p>
<p>It also didn’t help that I was reading via PDF, honestly. With a PDF, the less scrolling I have to do to read a particular bit, the better, so any pages I scroll past are a waste of my attention and energy.</p>

<p>Its interesting to hear about how differently we read rpg books! Personally, I find boardgame style dense rules text hard to read, so I prefer a loose style, with fiction elements to give it more air. I find it sad that the use of fiction text in rpg books gets such a bad rap, although I’ve certainly read my share of books where such material is low quality and pointless.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think White Wolf did a lot to contribute to that, with pages of pure fiction you turned past, searching for where the rules began. Not to mention that it was always nigh impossible to read even for someone with good eyesight, in the name of looking goth or edgy or something.</p>

              <p>Its interesting to hear about how differently we read rpg books! Personally, I find boardgame style dense rules text hard to read, so I prefer a loose style, with fiction elements to give it more air. I find it sad that the use of fiction text in rpg books gets such a bad rap, although I’ve certainly read my share of books where such material is low quality and pointless.</p>

              <p>Oddly enough, I prefer larger print formats and wish my favorite games used them.</p>
<p>I enjoy smaller, portable books when I’m reading for leisure, but if I’m trying to grok the system, reference it in play, or use it for generating characters, places, and things – even with great layout – I have to weigh down the pages to keep it from closing, and then I have to turn the page up to five or more times to see something that could have been laid out on a 8.5 x 11 page.</p>
<p>I think the real problem is that traditional publishers, like Wizards, use large print formats but don’t use the extra space to their advantage. While design savvy indie publishers use smaller formats out of tradition and partly because of cost.</p>
<p>In other words, to get back to the thread question: layout, writing, and marrying the two.</p>

<p>Both of the game’s I’ve done on my own are in somewhat similar page sizes and I think I’ll stick with it in the future as well.</p>

<p>How do people feel about print book dimensions? On one hand I love having nice big art pieces in <em>Spire</em> and <em>Tales from the Loop</em>. On the other, I generally find smaller form books like <em>Apocalypse World</em>, <em>Monsterhearts</em>, <em>Fiasco</em>, and <em>Blades in the Dark</em> much easier to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really wish more publishers would release Kindle or epub editions of their books. Yes, art and graphic design can convey a lot about the tone and fluff. But reading a multi-hundred page PDF tends to be annoying no matter how well designed or bookmarked.</p>

              <p>I like to have a concise introduction chapter that explains, a) what the game is about &amp; what stories you might tell with it, and b) how the book itself is structured. Even if I’ll never read it again, it would help me that very first time.</p>
<p>Also: Consider using sidebars. Not only are they great to condense information, give explanations or tips, or provide a bit of fluff, they also serve to break up the text a bit so it doesn’t become a wall.</p>

              <p>This is something of a sidetrack from readability, but when I read those “what is roleplaying” notes, they often feel like an afterthought someone has put in because all rpg books are supposed to have them, without really thinking about it.</p>
<p>I mean, you could make an analysis: Is this book going to be an entry point into roleplaying? If its something like D&amp;D or Vampire, the answer is probably yes. For other types games, it could be no.</p>
<p>The most half-assed “what is roleplaying” I’ve read recently was in Symbaroum (otherwise a very good game), where they used jargon like PC without explaining what it meant. I mean, if someone knows what PC means, they don’t need the “what is roleplaying” intro.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think these are a lost opportunity: Instead of defining what is roleplaying, that same energy could be used to define roleplaying in the specific context of this game. After all, D&amp;D roleplaying is quite different from A Quiet Year roleplaying.</p>

<p>One first step is to jettison everything that assumes the user might not know what an RPG is, how it works, or why you’d play one. Not just in the intro, but throughout the text. Cookbooks don’t explain what cooking is and video games don’t have a ‘what is an X-box’ tutorial.</p>
