    <description>Rich Kid Problem$ [PLAYTEST]
![Screen Shot 2020-08-12 at 11.00.49 AM|403x500](upload://rCoxgBf2RfBiCj3Uci2wsESQk6W.jpeg) 

Play the sons and daughters of warlords, mafia bosses, monopolist media houses and your favorite corporate hegemony. That’s right!  **Be born Filthy RichTM Currently workshopping this but gameplay is a cross between pasiones and PBTA. 

Your Rich Kid has two trackers (possible endings) either ascending into clan power or reclaiming their own power. They always have ONE thing their money/privelage/power can&#39;t buy. Playbooks are Military Might, Black Market, Novae Rich, Old Money, Rich &amp; Famous. There&#39;s no &quot;better&quot; ending/goal you can make your rich kid as greedy or fck my clan/establishment as you want. 

We will be RPing our favorite spoiled, sheltered, possibly ignorant brats who are trying their best to navigate who they are in and out of the clan.As love is one of the things these rich kid$ make a lot of sacrifices for, a lot of the movesets are hardcoded for relationships and romance in the game. So please sign-up only if you&#39;re open to romance (*cough drama) w/ PCs and NPCs. 

CW: violence, people being so fcking rich and getting away w things, class violence, manipulation, Clan/family politics.One seat is reserved for Caro Ascension. It would be ideal that you be able to play your Rich Kid$ for all 3 sessions. I am so so so so so grateful for everyone&#39;s creativity and time. I am (also) posting this so that I can force myself to finish the revision. Thank you!

All sessions are Saturday 8am Manila time (GMT+8)
