    <description>Public access for this game begins at [date=2020-05-28 time=16:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;].

*In the arts district, across the river, in the older part of downtown, there is a small and unassuming coffee shop, in a shambling brick building. An ordinary-looking place, without ostentatious signage or even a chalkboard of specials set out in the sidewalk.*

*If you peer in through the dusty window, however, you will see an unusual array: almost all the patrons are supernaturals.*

*The Queen of Cups is a peaceful place. Everyone pledges to be on best behavior. You don’t find the faeries fighting with the cave trolls, or else nobody gets their coffee. Sometimes you run out of oat milk or caramel syrup. Sometimes the toaster is broken. Sometimes a selkie misses home, or a medusa lost her job (again). These are the kind of problems it’s up to you to listen to, sympathize with, and maybe even help fix.*

*___*

The Queen of Cups is a GMless, diceless tarot-based RPG of cozy emotional play. Players will take turns playing as the wait staff and patrons in an urban fantasy coffee shop.

This is a one-shot. The game will take place over Zoom and will be recorded and shared on YouTube with player permission.
