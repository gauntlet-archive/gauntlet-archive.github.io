    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/02/16/crowdfunding-collection-160/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #160, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/07 and 02/15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;].

This time around there are 48 ZineQuest projects, 12 of those a tabletop roleplaying games and gamebooks. There are 153 ZineQuest projects as well (I put those in another article).

If you are a fan of the works of Jane Austen, you should check out the newest edition of the &lt;b&gt;Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG&lt;/b&gt;. The creators of the game, do offer a new card set as well, and proved to be reliable when I backed the first edition. Thus, you should check it out. I did actually back &lt;b&gt;Inner City Redux&lt;/b&gt;. It is an rpg with quite a history, which focuses on 60s to 80s style police/action dramas. The newest edition claims to offer the option to play at both sides of the law, which had me intruiged. If you like generic/universal game settings, maybe take a look at the card based &lt;b&gt;Oracle Roleplaying System&lt;/b&gt;? The artwork looks solid. Then there’s the &lt;b&gt;Freelancer: Skies Over Tolindia Roleplaying Game&lt;/b&gt;, in which you can explore an industrial fantasy world. Or maybe you like superheroes? In which case, check out &lt;b&gt;Amazing Heroes&lt;/b&gt;.
Fans of fantasy, can’t or shouldn’t look past the newest edition of &lt;b&gt;THE ONE RING™ Roleplaying Game&lt;/b&gt;! It is quite beautiful to look at, offers the setting in all its depths and the system apparently manages to transport the feeling of the book (according to friends). If you are maybe looking for rather Ghibli inspired fantasy, check out &lt;b&gt;Our Traveling Home&lt;/b&gt; by Ash Kreider. It’s a PbtA game with 5 playbooks, which aimes to enable you to create positive, light hearted stories. They did as well put a design focus on highlighting queerness, including queer sexualities and nonbinary genders, as well as give room and portray minority groups. I do like the approach, the artwork and Ghibli movies, and thus recommend you check it out.
If you are up for an science fiction system, check out the D&amp;D 5E OGL based game &lt;b&gt;Farsight&lt;/b&gt;. It looks nice. With &lt;b&gt;Reborn in Power: Codex 0&lt;/b&gt; you’ll get even more science fiction.
There are plently more projects. Like the setting &lt;b&gt;Trudvang: Seed of Vanirs&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;Roll4It Pride Dice&lt;/b&gt;, or the &lt;b&gt;Pride D20 Enamel Pins&lt;/b&gt;. You will find these, and many more projects in this article..

You will find the „ZineQuest“ projects started, within this blog article:
