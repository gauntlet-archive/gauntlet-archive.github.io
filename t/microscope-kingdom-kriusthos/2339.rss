This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

*Kriusthos is a fortified island city-state on the coast of the mythical continent of Elpis. It was founded three generations ago by the survivors of a supernatural apocalypse. It is assumed it is the last city in the world.*

*Here it is written how the City of the Ram came to be, as well as how it vanished back into history.*

We come together to create the creation and fall of a city-state at the end of the world, in a setting inspired by early and middle Antiquity, as well as its internal dynamics. The city will be used for an Antiquity/mythological urban picturesque game. 

Microscope (Explorer) and Kingdom will be used. 

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
