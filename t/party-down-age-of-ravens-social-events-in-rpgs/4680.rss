    <description>On the Gauntlet Blog today I talk about using parties, balls, celebrations, and festivals in rpgs. Not just as a backdrop, but as an active thing the PCs have to plan and execute. I offer some ideas for breaking down the tasks and possible complications. I also offer the example of a recent Changeling the Lost PbtA session and the custom moves we used to resolve the effect of the party ritual.

              <p>I agree! Concerning the lessons about teamwork I have with my seven to eight year old students I made a little game where they have to prepare a surprise birthday party for mom before she returns from work. No dice rolling but using actions as a resource. Doing something together often makes it twice as quick, but you can also do two different things at the same time instead. And some things need two or more people to do. (like moving a couch or something). They have to finish the preparations before the 'mom-returns" timer/clock is filled.</p>
<p>Maybe one of these days I get into writing it up and lay-outing it, and perhaps even translating it to English. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I firmly believe we don’t have enough parties in role-playing games. Not nearly enough festivals, celebrations, grand balls, weddings, holiday feasts, etc. They’re expected in something like 7th...</p>
