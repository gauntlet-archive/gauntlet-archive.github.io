          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2021/05/02/crowdfunding-collection-167/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #167, including every tabletop rpg project started between 04/25 and 05/02</b></a>.</p>
<p>Following the May celebrations, I am back on time. Thus let’s get to the projects.</p>
<p><b>Garden of the Giants</b> is a game in which you’ll be playing anthropomorphic mice, who’ll experience adventures akin to those from children tales. The presentation is beautiful, and I like the setting. Plus, there is a preview for interested backers to check out. I think it’s worth having a look. Then there’s <b>Courts of Blades</b>, which focuses more on politics, diplomacy and skullduggery in a renaissance setting. You’ll be playing a coterie caught in the web of intruiges and drama, with a system based on Blades in the Dark. Worth having a look too. If you like to have 9 games with one project, <b>Pretentious Games for Villains and Bastards</b> would be right up your ally. The games are made to be played in a one shots or micro-campaigns. anbieten. The kickstarter projects offers a little description of each of the games, for you to check out.<br>
If you fancy Fantasy and PbtA, <b>Fantasy World</b> should be right up your ally. The game offers an interesting looking setting, which doesn’t seem to be a standard Edo one, and it will be available in English and Italian! Maybe you like your Fantasy with more of a Sword and Sorcery drift, in which case you should have a look at <b>Blood, Sweat &amp; Steel</b>. Systemwise it is based on Fudge, and the project highlights game specific rules.<br>
If you are a fan of Science Fiction, I would recommend having a look at <b>ChangedStars</b>. The game offers a bright yet prelious future, inspired by utopian, feminist SF works, as well as contemporary gritty ones. The whole game is d6 based with 4 attributes and looks solid, with quite interesting illustration. Thus it does see me tempted. <b>Ironsworn: Starforged</b> transports the Fantasy Ironsworn setting and rules into the Science Fiction genre. The game can be played alone, with two players or with a „regular“ amount of players. The system is PbtA inspired, and the makers proved their mettle with previous projects. Check it out.<br>
Maybe you are looking for a game book? <b>ROTATOR</b> offers the first entry to a Science Fantasy story, written by a creator living in Ukraine. It features cool illustration, and is worth having a look for those alone.<br>
There are of course more interesting projects, like the <b>Eldritch Sands</b> setting for D&amp;D 5E, the bright green, printable <b>Hollow Dice</b> with braille readability, or the <b>Shelf File of Holding</b>, to stuff all your Kickstarter books into a nice DCC folder thing.<br>
You’ll find these, and more projects, here:</p>
