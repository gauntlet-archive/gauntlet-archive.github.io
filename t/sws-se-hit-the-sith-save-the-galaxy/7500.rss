    <description>This one-shot is based on &#39;Hit the Street - Defend the Block&#39; (or more precisely my drift of Rich&#39;s game to Pulp Archetypes, Hit the Nazi - Retrieve the Ark). This is set in the early years of the Rebellion against the Empire as portrayed in the first SW Movie - the real first one - not the prequels.
