This is the first in a series of four sessions of [Bite Marks](https://bite-marks.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders) by Becky Annison of [Black Armada Games](https://blackarmada.com/). Bite Marks is a game in which you play a pack of werewolves who must maintain the balance between man and wolf, manage the deep and sometimes messy relationships within the pack, and still stand strong against their foes. Unless the video chat landscape changes between now and the game, we will probably play using the [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) browser-based chat tool. With the consent of all involved, this game will be recorded and later uploaded to Youtube.

It’s 1971, and in the industrial North of England the mod scene is morphing into the music and fashion movement that will be known as Northern Soul. Frequently unlicensed clubs in the factory towns and cities feature so-called “DJs”, who use new dual-turntable techniques to keep the sound of Motown flowing all night long. The working men and women seek release from the drudgery of their day-to-day lives in music, exuberant dancing, and the amphetamines that help them keep going all night long. Huntersley is a village to the North of Sheffield, the Steel City, the boundary between the heavily industrialised Don Valley and the farmlands outside. And the wolfpack who live there are also caught between two worlds. The duties and obligations of their mundane lives, and the nights when they can run free as wolves. But which will be the greater threat - the crushing inevitability of modernity, or the old secrets that dwell in the dark?

Content Warning: This game will almost certainly feature violent content, and probably consensual sexual content. The game also deals with ideas of social domination, and loss of personal control. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under [the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.
