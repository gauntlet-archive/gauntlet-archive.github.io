    <title>Old School Essentials: The Incandescent Grottoes</title>

    <description>**One spot in this game is saved for David S.** 

Deep in the magical forest is a glade, its location all but forgotten, that opens onto the underworld below. Once, humans fought for control of these tunnels and caves, but now all that remain of their struggles are rumours, legends and—you hope—the treasure they left behind. Now you begin your descent. Now you discover that terrible things still ooze in the darkness. 

Old School Essentials is an OSR game based on early editions of DnD. This series will be a full-blown dungeon crawl as you explore the titular Grottoes, facing grave danger at every turn. You’ll be low-level characters and the risk of death will be high. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter in this game includes fantasy violence. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door. The game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

Sessions will run on Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. If players consent, I’ll record the sessions for my own use (as a terrible note-taker), but will only post them publicly if everyone is into that. 

Attendance at all sessions is not required, but please sign up for all sessions you&#39;d like to attend. 

I’ll email players a week before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials. 

Open access time for sign ups is 4pm 8/11/22 AEDT.
