Greetings Gauntleteers!

I&#39;ll be running four sessions of my new game **Afterlife: Wandering Souls** in April. Afterlife is a strange fantasy game where you play a Wanderer—a traveler who passed from the world of the living into the world of the dead. With no memories of who you once were your goal is to discover truths about yourself—as hard as that may be. 


**Here are all the sessions:**

[Afterlife: Wandering Souls - The Wall of Thorns (Session 1 of 2)](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-L_r6mKlECCJPUYvslaF)
[date=2019-04-03 time=20:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;] → [date=2019-04-03 time=23:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]

[Afterlife: Wandering Souls - The Wall of Thorns (Session 2 of 2)](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-L_r7W8rhXTQzfrDMQG-)
[date=2019-04-10 time=20:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;] → [date=2019-04-10 time=23:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]

[Afterlife: Wandering Souls - The Drowned Lands (Session 1 of 2)](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-L_r8tibHdKdbDxFJCil)
[date=2019-04-17 time=20:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;] → [date=2019-04-17 time=23:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]

[Afterlife: Wandering Souls - The Drowned Lands (Session 2 of 2)](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-L_r9hL6-9Vsi9MUjIg2)
[date=2019-04-24 time=20:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;] → [date=2019-04-24 time=23:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]

Each game is scheduled for 3-4 hours and will be recorded on Google Hangouts. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. Pre-made characters are provided.

The game launches on Kickstarter in May 2019, but you can find all the mechanics information you need in the free quickstart on [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/267900/Afterlife-Wandering-Souls-Quickstart ).

___________________________________________

*Welcome to the Tenebris. You died and something went wrong. You were meant to ascend to heaven, walk the path of reincarnation, be food for worms—that did not happen. Instead, you took a solemn boat ride across darkened water with other lost souls. Desperately trying to retain memories from your former life, you realized you cannot go back. The light at the end of the watery tunnel revealed an endless desert, known by its inhabitants as the Tenebris—the dark.*

*Yet the sand does not scare you, not like the truth. The truth is your memories are gone and you don’t know what you did to deserve the Tenebris. Destiny itches under your skin, pushes you forward, the end calls you. You search for your Requiem, the end to your journey, and cling to the hope that something waits for you in the Beyond. You only truly fear Stagnation—the death of that hope—the knowledge that you’ll be part of the Tenebris forever.*
