    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/new-zine-for-translated-games/1634</link>
    <description>Hey all,

I’m setting up a Patreon for zine that collects games, hacks, poems, LARPs, etc. that were previously unavailable in English. Smaller stuff is preferred since I’ll be aiming for a 32 page, B&amp;W, digest sized zine.

I’m looking for an army of translators active in game scenes that can pitch me games they’d like to see translated so I can pay them to do that. I don’t mind helping with editing and localizing so you’d by no means have to be a professional translator. 

I’d pay translators to translate games they’re psyched about and then give the original authors a royalty cut from copies sold.

If you or anyone you know is interested in being a translator who can approach game authors to get their works translated for me I’d love to hear from you! On here, email is samjokopublishing@gmail.com, twitter handle is kylejsimons.</description>

              <p>The first issue of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/samjoko" rel="nofollow noopener">Babel</a> is out and it is amazing! Non-English game designers, presenting their work in translation.</p>
<p>My friend Joy Min’s game <em>Fallen Lobelia</em> is a really surprising mashup of Gumshoe and an escape room!</p>
<p>In Katatamuri’s game <em>Preserved Blossoms of Love</em>, you play a character with three stats: Trowel, Watering Can, and Shears!</p>
<p>And Tina Trillitzsch’s game <em>Dear Distant Stars</em> is a melancholy two-player space tear-jerker! If you like The Skeletons, or 183 Days, or being sad and lonely, this is for you!</p>
<p>Please support this and similar projects; roleplaying is such a monoculture and there are so many interesting people working in languages other than English right now.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I’d be willing to talk to a publisher for sure. I’d also be willing to pay to translate a free and open source thing (as long as the author allows for it and are ok with that happening). My main stipulation is that the game text cannot yet exist in English.</p>
<p>If you could tap into the indie community/Twitterverse and find individuals making game poems, microgames, game supplements, experimental stuff, too, that would be super cool as well.</p>

<p>I am really interested in contributing, but only good Polish games I can think of were released for sale and would probably require some sort of licensing from the publishers.</p>

              <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I’m setting up a Patreon for zine that collects games, hacks, poems, LARPs, etc. that were previously unavailable in English. Smaller stuff is preferred since I’ll be aiming for a 32 page, B&amp;W, digest sized zine.</p>
<p>I’m looking for an army of translators active in game scenes that can pitch me games they’d like to see translated so I can pay them to do that. I don’t mind helping with editing and localizing so you’d by no means have to be a professional translator.</p>
<p>I’d pay translators to translate games they’re psyched about and then give the original authors a royalty cut from copies sold.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you know is interested in being a translator who can approach game authors to get their works translated for me I’d love to hear from you! On here, email is <a href="mailto:samjokopublishing@gmail.com">samjokopublishing@gmail.com</a>, twitter handle is kylejsimons.</p>
