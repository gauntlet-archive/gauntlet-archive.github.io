<p>All sessions will take place at 1:00pm US Central time on Fridays, July through September.</p>
<p>This is a quarterly run of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/360858/The-Between" rel="nofollow noopener">The Between</a>, a game of monster hunters in a gothic Victorian London by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncordova6" rel="nofollow noopener">Jason Cordova</a> and published by the Gauntlet. The Between is a game designed for campaign play and is most enjoyable for everyone if it is played with a stable cast of characters. Therefore, please only sign up if you can make a good faith effort to attend for the full run, with the understanding that absences happen, the Open Door Policy is in full effect, and 100% attendance is not expected from any player–including myself! We will play via Zoom. I would prefer to record and post the sessions to YouTube so they are archived for those looking for actual play reference material. (My YouTube videos average well under 10 views–I do not expect this to be a popular series!) I will still ask for consent of all participants on a session-by-session basis, but please do not sign up if you are opposed to being recorded. All access sign-ups will be available at 1pm US Central time on May 10, 2022.</p>
<p>The Between is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of mysterious monster hunters in Victorian-era London. These hunters learn about various monstrous threats in the city and conduct investigations, or “hunts,” in order to neutralize them. They gradually become aware of the machinations of a criminal mastermind who is sometimes connected to the threats, but always scheming to bring the Crown to its knees. The hunters will ultimately be forced to reckon with this criminal mastermind in order to save the country.</p>
<p>The Between is directly inspired by the TV show Penny Dreadful, but also takes inspiration from British horror classics, the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, pulp-era media, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.The Between is Powered by the Apocalypse, meaning its mechanics are inspired, in part, by Vincent and Meguey Baker’s Apocalypse World. It is also Carved from Brindlewood, meaning the mystery mechanics and procedures are inspired by Brindlewood Bay.</p>
<p>Content Warnings: This is a game inspired by Victorian pulp gothic fiction and media inspired by it, and as such some very dark themes are inherent to both the threats and the player characters themselves, as well as a focus on sexuality and sensuality. This includes but is not limited to graphic violence, murder, cannibalism, body horror, dark sexual themes (though not sexual violence), sex work, threats to children and animals, foul language, blasphemy, witchcraft, and defiling corpses. We will also likely touch on some of the social horror of the Victorian era. We will be using safety tools, but if this does not sound like the sort of material you would like to engage with, this game is probably not for you. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct</a> and the safety tools Lines &amp; Veils and X-Card will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.</p>
