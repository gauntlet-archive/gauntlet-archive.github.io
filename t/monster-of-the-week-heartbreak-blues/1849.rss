    <title>Monster of the Week: Heartbreak Blues</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/monster-of-the-week-heartbreak-blues/1849</link>
    <description>Johnny Ray’s has seen better days but it’s still the heart of the blues scene in Memphis. Unfortunately, its finest player was found missing his own heart, and an investigation might just be what finally shuts the place down. That is, unless you can get to the bottom of whatever can tear a man’s heart from his chest without leaving a mark.

Monster of the Week is a pbtA game of supernatural investigation, and Heartbreak Blues is a mystery available in its expansion, Tome of Mysteries. This oneshot is scheduled for 4 hours and will be recorded with players’ permission.

The X-Card is on the table and the Gauntlet Inclusivity policy will be in effect. We’ll also use Lines and Veils.
