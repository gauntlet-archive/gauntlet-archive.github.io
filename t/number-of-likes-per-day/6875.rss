    <title>Number of likes per day</title>

    <description>What&#39;s the limit for the number of likes per day on Gauntlet?

I recently received the Regular badge, where it said: &quot;and you’ll also get lots more likes per day.&quot;

Seemed weird, so I looked it up: &quot;Daily like limit increased by 2×&quot;

Weird that there is a built in mechanic that makes new people feel unappreciated.</description>

              <p>Ah, I see now that I misunderstood. The limit is about <em>giving</em> likes, not receiving. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>This limit is super simple to hit for someone like myself. When I join a community, I tend to read through as much of the stuff I find interesting as I can. And since I joined when there were already a few dozen great design threads, hitting likes on the stuff I found great wasn’t hard at all.</p>

              <p>I think the default is 50, though like everything else it can be changed. I’ve never used it on any forum. Which is a shame, because you get a badge if you do.</p>
<p><em>Edit to add:</em> I see 17 people have used their 50 daily likes at least once, which is pretty amazing.</p>

              <p>Discourse (the forum platform) is built around a self-defined concept of “trust,” so it’s meant to be a security/safety feature to prevent spammers and encourage (?) participation so that you can be “trusted” (by the system). It’s not a great, imo, and the forums are bit more restrictive than they need to be.</p>
