    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Yellow 2! This one is called “Three Dozen More Forbidden Texts.” It’s a sequel to the original “Three Dozen Forbidden Texts” miscellany in Codex - Yellow.

Submissions should be no more than a few sentences. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please avoid anything that seems like misogyny or sexual predation—we won’t publish stuff like that.

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

For examples, please see the original “Three Dozen Forbidden Texts,” linked below. Pay particular attention to the variety of things that count as &quot;texts.&quot; Your entry doesn&#39;t have to be a book.

Among it’s many transgressions is the fabled ‘23 pages of box text’ that begin the adventure.It’s been described equally as languid, trope-filled and littered with typos.Topics include: two dead baron’s eating habits, three vanquished wizard’s love affairs, the trials of one particularly malnourished horse and lengthy, predictable descriptions of women’s bosoms. Absolutely none of the text culminates in any real sense of place or narrative and ultimately leaves the reader confused and bored.</p>

Not two hours after deciphering the message embedded in the signal, the entire crew erupted into an orgy of violence. All aboard were lost in the bloodbath. Interstellar Command has since quarantined the Theta Draconis system, and deployed a flotilla of armed jammer drones to prevent anyone else from receiving that signal. Rumors still circulate that the ISC salvaged the <em>Zheng He’s</em> computer core before scuttling the starship, but any information about that incident is accessible only to those with Omega-class security clearance.</p>

              <p>The book Nec Deum Nec Dominum has had many names throughout the millennia, but always appears in a language easily read by the people in desperate need who discover it. Upon reading it, they are imbued with certain, terrible purpose. A brief period of suffering inevitably follows, as it follows any sudden, dramatic change, but in its wake is liberation from churches, royalty, and other abusive power structures. The book vanishes soon after, never to be seen by those people again.</p>

              <p>The Chronicle of the Droning Queen is the entire history of the Buzzing Empress, laid out carefully in wax and honey in the  layered chambers of the Cyclopean Hive. There is the gestalt wisdom of ages, carefully-observed ephemera of flora long-extinct, encoded within the arrangement of those waxen cells. Of course, the only way for a scholar to pursue it would be to either become queen themselves, or carefully dismantle the cathedral-sized hive one layer at a time.</p>

              <p><em>Bad Dog</em> A 1981 video game written and self-published by Sharik Preobrazhensky for the APPLE II.  Like many games of the time it was sold in a plastic bag with minimal art or instructions (a mimeographed card insert in broken English listing many of the basic commands) with a childish cartoon of a smug dog chewing on a human arm on the reverse.  A typical action game of the time, the player’s avatar a block pixelated dog who navigates a 2D maze “the house” to find and devour the “master”.  The game is marred by a discordant soundtrack of inexplicable buzzing, seemingly the result of a bad conversion from MicrosoftBASIC to ApplesoftBASIC.  Rumors on hacker BBS at the time <em>Bad Dog</em> was published indicate that if the sound code was compiled and run separately on a Microsoft machine it produced both a cheerful tinny song and odd higher pitched noises that the orginal poster/tester claims made both his pet chihuahua ‘Lasagna’ and hamster “Krull” aggressively violent.  There is no other record of Sharik Preobrazhensky, beyond one post on the “Jungle Kingdom BBS” of Long Island in August 1980 in it’s “Animal Rights and Rites” forum where a user with Sharik’s name posts that he’s “No going to be around much … [he’s] hard at work on something to punish the Exploiters and Speciesists!”</p>

Due to improper comma placement, and a far sighted print shop manager, the 2,000,000 copies have been moving through the surplus book market like, well, like a boiled ham through a python. Enterprising used book stores have tried offering it for free, but not a single customer has ever accepted it.</p>

The four Side A tracks are late-80s hair-metal songs of mediocre quality; the singer doesn’t articulate well, and the lyrics and nearly impossible to parse. The Side B track consists of 22 minutes 30 seconds of silence, followed by a 9-second dissonant chord of unknown instrumentation.</p>
