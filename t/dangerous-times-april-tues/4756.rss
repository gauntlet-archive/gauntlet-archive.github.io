This is for two April sessions of *Dangerous Times: Muckrakers and Magic in Old New York* . Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged, but not required. Rules will be taught. In session one we will establish tone, create our characters, and get going.

&gt; “players…take the role of reporters, through a prohibition-era New York City that’s recently discovered magic.
&gt; 
&gt; During this time reporters who sought to make the world a better place were known colloquially as “muckrakers”. They worked for social change.
&gt; 
&gt; Each session plays out as a single issue of the newspaper. Together, players will build rumors and leads, gather evidence, and turn facts into news articles. At the end, players consider the impacts their publication has made, and whether the world changes for the better or the worse.”

We will be using Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
