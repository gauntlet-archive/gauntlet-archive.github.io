    <description>**For the first 72 hours please only sign up if you have a) joined the Gauntlet this year and b) haven’t yet played with me.**

Sessions are on Saturday mornings US Eastern in July. General RSVP is now open.

This is for the first of five sessions of *Masks*, a game of young superheroes trying to deal with their powers and relationships. In this world, things have gone wrong: villains in positions of power, zombies on the streets, alien invasion—we’ll make and tweak our world to decide what’s messed it up and what can be done. In session one we will also set tone and safety, make characters, and get playing. There will be a curated selection of playbooks.

Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.

              <p>I see you have slots left.</p>
<p>I could attend every session except the 2nd. Would that be okay?</p>
<p>I’ve never played a game on Gauntlet and I’ve played very few RPGs (some 5e, three games of fiasco, one of wanderhome).</p>
