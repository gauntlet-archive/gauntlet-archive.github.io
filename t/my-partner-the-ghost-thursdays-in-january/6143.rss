    <description>My Partner the Ghost is a game for **two players and one GM**, powered by the Apocalypse. One player is a human investigator and the other is a ghost. Together they solve mysteries.

This is a new game and will be published in the forthcoming **Codex - Ectoplasm 2**.

## The Mood

You solve mysteries, and you’re a ghost. You can’t do it alone, of course. You can’t accuse the villain when no one can see you, right? So, you have a human sidekick. That’s what you call them anyway, when you’re talking to the other ghosts. Together you solve mysteries. The human does the easy part, sneaking around decrepit mansions and skulking around caves and interrogating suspects and such. You’ve got the hard part -- pointing them in the right direction and revealing clues, which is especially hard because, well, they can’t see you. Or hear you. Not yet. You’re working on it, though.

You solve mysteries, and you’re a private investigator. You can’t do it alone, of course. You can’t phase through walls or get past magical locks, right? So, you have a ghostly sidekick. That’s what you call them anyway, when you’re monologuing to the camera. Together you solve mysteries. The ghost does the easy part, giving confusing hints and scaring people and sneaking into secure places and such. You’ve got the hard part -- risking your life and reputation in the pursuit of truth, which is especially hard because, well, no-one believes you have an undead partner. Not yet. You’re working on it, though.
