<p>NUMBER OF SESSIONS: 5, being able to attend each session is strongly requested, you must RSVP to each session.</p>
<p>DURATION: 3 hours</p>
<p>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 4 (a seat is being reserved for Donogh)</p>
<p>CONTENT WARNING: This game may include violence, but it will not be graphic. It may include alcohol and smoking. If players consent, there may be themes of romance/sexual tension between player-controlled characters, and/or player and GM-controlled characters, but anything more explicit than a passionate kiss or embrace will be veiled.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh, welcome Travelers, welcome, welcome, a thousand times welcome! Have you been traveling together long? Not that such a thing matters, of course, but you seem to be brave, curious ‚Ä¶ even intrepid, perhaps? There are many things to see and do in the area, but ‚Ä¶ oh, goodness me, I‚Äôm just prattling away about this place when I bet you‚Äôre passing through on your way to the Festival Of Calliope in Sur De Mer, aren‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs delightful, absolutely delightful, the singing and dancing and music and food ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs absolutely the sort of thing I would have traveled to see on my journey if I didn‚Äôt live so close to it. Sadly, I can‚Äôt go very often - there‚Äôs no one here to keep the fire going if I do and I‚Äôm sure you can understand how important that is for an inn ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>Ryuutama is a game about journeys and what happens along the way. It is an ancient custom that, at least once in their lives, everyone - no matter their station in life - will take an extended journey. This ritual is so important that a Traveler‚Äôs friends, family, and neighbors will all pitch in to take care of things - their farm, their business, their home, and so on - in their absence. People they meet along the way are likely to be helpful, perhaps asking the Traveler to do something for them - deliver a letter or message, pass along a parcel, investigate a curiosity and so on.</p>
<p>In this game, players will be traveling together as a party. Some of you may have been traveling with others longer; perhaps some of you even come from the same place. We‚Äôll learn about where you came from, why you‚Äôre traveling together, and what draws you to the Festival Of Calliope. Is it curiosity? The honor of representing your home in one of its many competitions? Or is it something else entirely?</p>
<p>SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: This session will use a lengthy list of Lines and Veils to facilitate an initial baseline for player safety. Players are absolutely encouraged to add more topics to the list for their own safety. This session will also use the N-Card, X-Card, and Script Change as necessary to adjust the game while it‚Äôs in progress to maintain player safety. Finally, the Open Door Policy is always in effect and players may leave the game at any time for any length of time for any reason. This session will also adhere to The Gauntlet‚Äôs Community Code of Conduct: <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html</a></p>
<p>RSVP OPEN ACCESS TIME: 04/07/2021 19:00 Central Time</p>
<p>SET UP INFO: We will use Streamyard for the event. Players should expect a reminder email approximately one week before the series starts.</p>
<p>BREAKS: Two breaks of approximately 5-10 minutes</p>
<p>RECORDED: If all participants consent, it will be recorded and (eventually) uploaded to YouTube.</p>
<p>PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: No experience required, rules will be taught.</p>
