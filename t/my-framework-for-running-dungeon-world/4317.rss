    <description>I&#39;ve been working on the GMing chapters for Stonetop lately, and really thinking about the structure of the conversation. That lead me to writing up this (very long) blog post.  

I&#39;d be all sorts of interesting in thoughts or feedback. In particular:
* Does the &quot;structure of the conversation&quot; ring true those of you who play a lot of DW (or other PbtA)?  
* What PbtA games break from this structure?  How so, and why do you  think they do?
* What would you add? What&#39;s missing?  What doesn&#39;t hold up?

Cheers!

              <p><strong>Your article is purely amazing.</strong></p>
<h3>You point out what I find sometimes missing <em>(MC making a soft move)</em> and then I wonder for hours why was this game weak?</h3>
<p>The situation when MC frames scene establishes a situation but does not make a move and asks players “what do you do?” sometimes is quite empty and hard to start.<br>
<em>Example: “You are in the vault, it looks …  what do you do?”<br>
Answer: “I guess we start packing the gold?”</em><br>
This is missing the key component to put tension in the game.<br>
<em>Example: “You are in the vault, the trap you triggered is pouring tons of sand inside per second, also the orcs and trolls are in hot pursuit, what do you do?”</em><br>
Now that’s what I called a well framed action scene just pregnant with opportunities and actions to take.</p>
<h3>As to what games break your structure?</h3>
<p>I would say games that are not really about adventure. Like Urban Shadows. Where players have much more authority in deciding where they go and what do they want to do. I would often not do “soft move” for opening because we often had a move to establish the situation of a meeting with NPC or because we just know why the PC and NPC are meeting and situation does not require me to heat it up with another softy.</p>
<h3>What would I add?</h3>
<p>I find it that PbtA games don’t enough what should MC do on a miss. I think more should be said and <strong>explained about Fail Forward == Yes, But concept when making MC moves</strong>. Cast a Spell does force a Cleric to roll every time he casts, but a miss doesn’t have to mean “no and” it can be “yes, but”.<br>
Same goes for Fighter doing a bar brawl, a miss doesn’t mean some random dude beats up our fighter, it means our Fighter killed the random dude, everyone saw and and there will be problems.</p>

              <p>Nicely done!  I like the GM moves front and center to remind me to vary them up and not fall back on the ones I’m most comfortable with.</p>

              <p>Frankly, I live and die by your DW GMing advice, so this is great. One of the things I do often is reread GM principles/moves/reactions/et al across PbtA games that I pick up, even though they all fundamentally say the same thing. What I think your write-up does well here in walking through those things is meditate on why they are core skills or guiding lights to GMing (particularly PbtA).</p>
<p>All that being said, I think you hit it exactly on the structure of the conversation, but also expanded it clearly and just enough to elucidate <em>why</em> it is the structure the conversation. Really great read <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/+1/2.png?v=9" title=":+1:t2:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:t2:"></p>
