          <p>“As you know, Commander, the attack on Earth by the Borg was only halted by the heroic sacrifice of <em>The Enterprise.</em> Our fleet was devastated at Wolf 359, and numerous worlds, both Federation and non-aligned, were in the path of the Borg invasion.”</p>
<p>“Starfleet cannot afford to hesitate. We’ve accelerated development of a new flagship, and we your orders are to get out there and let everyone know that the Federation will not retreat from this attack. Get out there are rebuild. Get out there and explore. Get out there and look for any sign that the Borg may return, because they surely will now that they’re aware of us.”</p>
<p>“We’ve selected a crew, and while some of them may be… unseasoned, they all possess qualities we believe will make them exceptional officers, and ideal for the multi-facted mission you’re embarking upon. You won’t be the only ship out there, of course, but the burden to represent the Federation will be particularly heavy for you. Good luck. Dismissed.”</p>
<p>This will be an ongoing series of <em>Star Trek Adventures</em> set in an AU where the <em>Enterprise</em> was destroyed during the attack on Earth by the Borg. Jean-Luc Picard and all hands on <em>The Enterprise</em> are presumed dead after the Quantum Implosion that utterly annihilated both ships and significantly damaged Earth’s moon. The players will be the crew of the new Federation flagship, taking over <em>Enterprise’s</em> mission of exploration, first contact, and defense as needed. While deep Trek knowledge is not essential to play, some familiarity with the property, particularly the first thress seasons of TNG (which will form the canon backstory of our series), will be helpful. PLEASE NOTE that we will be playing with 5 crew members, which may mean occasional time spent waiting for the spotlight. I’ve reserved one spot the for the player who requested this series.</p>
<p>Players may sign up for as many or as few sessions as they wish, as with other episodic narratives, it’s easy for specialists to drop in and out depending on the mission. We’ll record sessions and if players consent I will post them to YouTube. We’ll use safety tools including X-Card/Script Change, Open Door, and Lines and Veils to make sure everyone has fun, but presume we’ll stick to the expected content for a current <em>Star Trek</em> TV series.</p>
<p>Every Wednesday evening in June and July at 8:00 PM Eastern US time.<br>
