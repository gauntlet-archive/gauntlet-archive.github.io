    <title>Card Math Question</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/card-math-question/4860</link>
    <description>Hi there. I&#39;m drafting a hack of *For the Queen* tentatively titled *It Always Ends in Fire,* about a doomed conspiracy to usher the world to its end. I&#39;m using ordinary playing cards and oracles instead of custom cards, to make it easier to get out into the world.

Hearts, diamonds, and clubs prompt players to consult the oracles. Spades are placed in the middle of the table as &quot;Premonitions,&quot; and when enough Premonitions have been drawn, the players answer the question &quot;Do you do your part to usher the world to its end?&quot; Like *FtQ,* I&#39;d like to have a suggested number of Premonitions for a short game and a long game, but I am totally ignorant of playing-card math.

Is there an engine that can calculate the likelihood of drawing a certain number of cards in a suit within a total number of draws? Or (even easier) games with similar mechanics I could look at to get a sense of how others have handled this? Thanks in advance!</description>

              <p>I like that idea! I’m trying to keep the rules overhead to the same minimum as the original <em>FtQ</em>, but I might have to compromise to get it to work with playing cards.</p>

              <p>you could add a rule that whenever you draw an omen you also draw another card or cards to help build the prompt, and put any additional spades drawn on the bottom of the deck. That way you ensure you always get a higher minimum cards drawn for the shortest possible game</p>

              <p>Thank you for that point! One flaw I figured out yesterday is that, with the above rules, the shorter the game gets, the more invention it demands from the players, and the less fictional support it gives them through prompts. I’m going to build a Spades/Omen oracle for the first draft before I test it out. I think, with prompts, a short Spades-dense game could actually be an interesting experience. But I need to get something playable first.</p>

              <p>Even if you have three or five cards that needs to be spades for the game to end, there will always be a session when you draw enough spades in a row for this to happen.</p>
<p>Some boardgames solves this by splitting the deck in half, and add end cards in the last stack of cards before shuffling each stack separately.</p>
