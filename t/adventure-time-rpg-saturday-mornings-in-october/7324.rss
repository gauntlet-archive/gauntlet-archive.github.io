This is for five Saturday morning (US Eastern) sessions of the *Adventure Time* rpg (*Hora de Aventuras Juego de Rol* in Spanish). We will be playing from a fan translation I’ve done of just the mechanical side of the rules. These rules are simple and will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged, but not mandatory. Some familiarity with the show and/or comic would be good. One seat is being reserved for Cisco.

In session one we will set tone and safety, make characters and then it will be adventure time. I expect this to be a fun fantasy exploration about characters and setting, but melodrama isn’t off the table. While *Adventure Time* is a cartoon, it can lean into some heavier themes about friendship, communication, betrayal, and beyond.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the links and to confirm attendance. CHECK YOUR SPAM FILTER. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.</description>
