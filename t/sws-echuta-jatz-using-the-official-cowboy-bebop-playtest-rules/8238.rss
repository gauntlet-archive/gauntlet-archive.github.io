    <description>Maybe you ran with the in-crowd. Maybe you ran into more trouble than creds. Maybe you just ran out of options.

Here you are, once a rising name as a Bounty Hunter or a wannabe Hunter.

Now&#39;s your chance, or off to the Spice Mines of Kessel you&#39;ll go, courtesy of your new and only employer, the Galactic Empire.

* You are a group of Bounty Hunters who&#39;ve gotten to know a little about each other while in a former Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center.
* You&#39;ve been recently paroled by the new Galactic Empire under the expressed condition that you will work for the Empire.
* Your assignment is to hunt down traitors (members of the Rebel Alliance), such as Senator Jar Jar Binks and return them alive to Coruscant to face a fair and public trial.

------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode III of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Revenge of the Sith* ) when the Galactic Empire is rising and the Rebel Alliance is working to become a united front to stop the Empire.
