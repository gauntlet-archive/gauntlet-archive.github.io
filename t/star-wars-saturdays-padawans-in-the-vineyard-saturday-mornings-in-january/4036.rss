During the days and months after the death of Emperor Palpatine, hope started to return to the galaxy. It grew in fits and starts, like a sapling planted on rocky ground.

In the far reaches of the Outer Rim, a fledging temple grew. The lone Jedi master sent out a group of young padawans in their own ship, with orders to seek out other potential students, others who might be able to understand The Force, who might be tempted by the Dark Side without the proper teaching. And, of course, if the padawans found trouble on those farflung planets, they should seek to bring peace and balance.

Padawans in the Vineyard is a loving reskin of D. Vincent Baker&#39;s *Dogs in the Vineyard* RPG.

-----------------------------------
This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is after Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the New Republic is trying to wrest control of the galaxy from its tyranny. Characters and settings created in this session will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries. 

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded and released assuming all parties agree.

There will be 4 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) safety tool will be in use.

              <p>This is fabulous! I’ve run some “Jedi in the Vineyard” games, and it’s always been a lot of fun. (Although I find that the resulting gameplay, at least when using Town Creation by-the-book, always felt like Dogs in the Vineyard with some Star Wars colour, never “like Star Wars”. It would be interesting to make a concerted effort to change that around, but I never have. I suspect it would take some different GM-side rules/procedures/prep. Do you have a particular perspective on this, Rich?)</p>
