    <description>![leverage|690x431](upload://q05YwxtptmTGGchr1VD139jH10k.jpeg) 

This is a series of four sessions of the Leverage RPG in August on Tuesday evenings (BST). Leverage was a game by Margaret Weis Productions using their Cortex engine, and based on the TV series of the same name. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (July 8th). This game will be played using the Open Table policy, so there is no need to commit to the full run - though the game will start with character creation and an introductory job, so I would not advise only signing up for the first session. A space will be reserved for Lowell Francis. Sessions will be three hours in length, and we will play using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). This game will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

*&quot;The rich and powerful, they take what they want. We steal it back for you.&quot;*
In Leverage you will play a crew of skilled, semi-reformed criminals who will conduct a series of daring heists and crafty cons  against people in power to provide restorative justice to those they have hurt and exploited. Hitter, Hacker, Grifter, Thief, Mastermind: Each member of the team will bring their own unique skill set to the job, but only by working together do you stand a chance of bringing down some of the most dangerous and powerful people out there. This game will use the Leverage RPG rules - due to its licence, the game is no longer available, but I will provide play materials in advance of the game. Prior knowledge of either the game itself or the series it&#39;s based upon is not required, though some knowledge of the series - or at least other hesit/caper media - may be useful for tone and terminology. Likewise, the game will be taught at the table, though giving a glance over the play material before the game begins may be useful as there is slightly more of a systems mastery element to it than some storygames.

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, and the Jimmy Hoffa Memorial Poker Championship at Nero&#39;s Playground casino. This annual event draws gamblers, thieves, and legitimate businessmen from all over the country for a few days of drinking, shoptalk, and backroom deals. But one group of thieves and grifters is here for business, not pleasure. Some of the most feared and dangerous figures in the underworld are here, they&#39;ve got a whole lot of money that&#39;s ready to burn, so get those stakes up higher!

Content Warning: While this is a game that deals with criminal - or at least highly unethical - behaviour, in keeping with the tone of the series the focus is not on lethal violence or intimate crime. However, some violence is still likely to feature, and policing is also likely to come up. Another element that may well come up is interpersonal manipulation and gaslighting as part of running cons on individuals. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
