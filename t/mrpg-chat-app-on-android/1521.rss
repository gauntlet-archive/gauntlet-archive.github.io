              <p>Speech-to-text is your friend, here, I think.  I have began using my phone as a laptop replacement at work, for about 90 percent of the work I have to do, and speech-to-text software is part of what has made this possible. I think, in the case of this role playing app, it would work too.  The quality of speech-to-text transcription has improved dramatically in the last two years.  The IME has It built-in on my phone.</p>
