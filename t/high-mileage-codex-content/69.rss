    <description>What articles, games, supplements or other bits of content from Codex have you gotten the most mileage out of?

For me, I&#39;ve played gobs of sessions in Lauren&#39;s Ballhir setting, and Rich&#39;s Lady Blackbird additions are so useful they show up in every game of that I run now.</description>

              <p>Has anybody mentioned <a class="mention" href="/u/tylom">@Tylom</a>’s Fire Ships At Midnight from Codex: Flame yet? I know that this gem saw some play, and I would totally play it again. It pretty good as a one shot option, too, if you feel like delving into the minds of the Armada commanders amids their glorious defeat.</p>

The most used Codex Zine I’ve got though, is the Discern Realities annual. I ran a long season of Dungeon World a little while ago and got to play with the shrines and magic items a lot. I also used the labyrinth move in a Dwarf tomb.</p>

<p>The Incursion structure is gold. I wrote and ran a grim-dark woods scenario for Halloween a few years ago that I’ve been reworking with the aim of running again. I’ve been thinking it over and unfortunately I don’t think it will work as an Incursion, but I will be using the Incursion advise to improve upon it.

              <p>I second <strong>Trophy</strong>.</p>
<p>Ever since I first read it in <strong>Codex: Dark II</strong>, the game has been simmering away on the backburner of my imagination - I find myself daydreaming little nuggets of moments. Finally got to run a game this evening on Gauntlet Hangouts using the published incursion <em>Tomb Of 10,000 Dreams</em>, and - wowser - it did not disappoint!</p>
<p>Trophy is pretty much the perfect one-shot RPG for me as a GM: a loose framework to suggest themes and motifs and seeds of inspiration, but with a system that allows and rewards spontaneity &amp; improvisation &amp; reincorporation. That ever-decreasing doom-spiral into madness, horror, and death is so perfectly paced by the Ruin / Ring mechanic… by the end things got so intense I was almost hyperventilating as a GM!</p>
<p>I can see myself running Trophy countless times in the future, even re-running favourite incursions over &amp; over to see how varied &amp; twisted the thematic imagery can be with each playthrough.</p>
<p>10,000 Dreams to Trophy’s author, <a class="mention" href="/u/jesseross">@jesseross</a> - you have created a beautiful monster.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to see what you come up with in yr incursion, <a class="mention" href="/u/sabinev5">@SabineV5</a>!</p>
