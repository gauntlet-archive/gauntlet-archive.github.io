Fellowship is a game about going on an adventure, in the same vein as *Lord of the Rings* or *Wakfu* or *The Legend of Zelda*.  The system is loosely based on the Apocalypse Engine, but the game does not feature the typical Game Master that many other tabletop games do. Instead, one player is the Overlord, a maniacal being who has become a Threat to the World, and everyone else forms a fellowship of heroes to stop them. The focus of Fellowship is on the journey you take and the communities you meet, and saving the day is what you&#39;re here to do.  Fellowship is also famous for its narrative control - each player determines a portion of how the world works, and you work together to create the world you will save.

There will be three sessions of [Fellowship 2e](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177662/Fellowship-2nd-Edition--A-Tabletop-Adventure-Game). The sessions will be streamed on YouTube Live and recorded for Gauntlet Hangouts. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend.

**Safety Tools:** We will use [Script Change](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change) and [Lines and Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913) during our sessions. We will observe the [Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
