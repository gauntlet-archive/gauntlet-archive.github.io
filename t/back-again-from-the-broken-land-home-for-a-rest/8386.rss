    <title>Back Again From the Broken Land: Home for a Rest</title>

    <description>You are small people who walked into a big war. The Doomslord’s forces were gathered in the Broken Land, and your fellowship unexpectedly played a key role in the Doomslord’s fall. Now, laden with stories to tell and burdens to bear, you set off on the journey home. But the Doomslord’s Hunters are still out there, and it’s a long way to walk… Back Again from the Broken Land. 

This is 2 sessions of Back Again from the Broken Land on the last two Thursdays in September 2022 at 8PM US Eastern time.

Back Again from the Broken Land a short Powered by the Apocalypse game of small adventurers sharing stories on a long walk home by Leah and Alexi Sargent. The game is inspired by the emotional, even bittersweet, stretches of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

Being able to attend both sessions is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. All-Access time is 12:00 PM US Eastern September 13, 2022.

We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links and resources. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), as well as Script Change for safety tools.
