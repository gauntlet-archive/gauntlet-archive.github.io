    <title>Masks: Phoenix Academy</title>

    <description>This game uses the &quot;Phoenix Academy&quot; playset from &quot;Unbound&quot;. (Description from &quot;Unbound&quot;) The Phoenix Academy is a secondary school devoted to teaching young people with powers how to use them in a responsible manner while also educating them in the ways of the world. Regular high school is a tough balance to maintain with academics, social events, extracurriculars, and other elements pulling at teenage attention. 

Though we are using Halcyon City as the setting described in &quot;A New Generation&quot; and elsewhere, we will have plenty of creative room to add or change things to suit our game.

The Masks products &quot;A New Generation&quot;, &quot;Unbound&quot;, and th &quot;Halcyon City Herald Collection&quot; are in use, as well as the following playbooks: The Beacon, the Bull, the Delinquent, the Doomed, the Harbinger, the Innocent, the Janus, the Joined, the Legacy, the Newborn, the Nomad, the Nova, the Outsider, the Protege, the Reformed, the Scion, the Star and the Transformed. It is possible that certain playbooks may need to be tweaked or re-imagined to fit in with the &quot;Phoenix Academy&quot; playset.

Being able to attend every session is ideal, but not required. You must RVSP to each session you wish to attend.

It is possible that this series will continue, with as many returning characters as possible, in subsequent months.

Tone and expectation for the game will be discussed beforehand. We will be using the X-Card and Lines and Veils, along with the Open Door policy being in effect. This series is operating under the Gauntlet&#39;s inclusivity policy, on which more information can be found here (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

              <p>Hey, Rory, so a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>posting the links is good form, since people might want to join the waitlist;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that being said, the rest of the sessions for this campaign are hardly full, when we consider the fact that 70% of games end up pulling from the waitlist. There’s only one person on the waitlist for session 2, and none for the rest of them, so posting the links is totally in your best interest (as well as the community’s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it’s probably best not to post the character keeper here, since this is basically an open forum. I was able to click through and gain editing permission to the keeper, so anyone else could do the same. Similar logic applies to the RFYP link.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope your campaign goes well!</p>
