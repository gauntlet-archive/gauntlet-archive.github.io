    <description>So a few friends of mine have been showing some interest in tabletop games. As far as I know, none of them have ever played any sort of tabletop RPG, so I&#39;m wondering how to introduce them to this entirely new hobby, BUT--

We&#39;re all history graduate students at a university, and I thought it could be kinda fun to give them a brief little lecture on the history of RPG&#39;s, the fundamental ideas of what even are RPG&#39;s, etc. whenever we get together, in the style of the kind of lectures we see and give as students and TA&#39;s. If giving/hearing a lecture on the history of anything sounds like the total opposite of fun to you, well, what can I say, that&#39;s how we are =P

It&#39;s really not meant to be anything in depth, just sort of a 10 minute &quot;RPG&#39;s 101&quot; thing to give them some really basic info before we really start with whatever game we play. I&#39;ve been brainstorming what points I&#39;d want to hit, but I was wondering what other people would come up with if they had to give a similar mini-lecture. 

I&#39;m really curious because I have to say I&#39;m fairly young/new compared to a lot of folks who have been in the scene a lot longer than I have, and I think there&#39;s a whole world of 80&#39;s/90&#39;s/00&#39;s RPG&#39;s that I&#39;m really only vaguely aware of.

Just really off the top of my head, you&#39;d have like:

* What is a tabletop roleplaying game... super basic concepts, intent, rules/mechanics to simulate X, polyhedral dice, etc.

* Origin: war games, Gary Gygax, D&amp;D (not gonna get into any controversy about if he really invented D&amp;D in this fun lil&#39; lecture, I&#39;d say...)

* Layering in the &#39;role-playing&#39; element on top of combat/tactics games, playing a character/telling a story, influenced by genre books, films, etc.

* 90&#39;s RPG scene offering popular genre alternatives to D&amp;D-- Shadowrun, World of Darkness, etc.

* Recently: &#39;indie&#39;/story games, PbtA, OSR, etc.

What points would you touch on if you were giving like a really broad, completely &quot;Intro to RPG&#39;s&quot;, 101 kind of lecture for some people? Importantly, assume they have *some* goodwill to listen to you, but you&#39;re probably not going to hold their attention for too long =P</description>

<p>I may have read in the steampunk thing in the illustrations I saw from Chronopia; I never played it or owned it so I’m guessing a bit.</p>
<p>It’s too bad the translation of Trudvang is that bad, though there’s a real chance the rules aren’t that much more clear in the original Swedish… I seem to remember some discussion about them being a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>Mutant Chronicles, yeah, that was a thing. I always dismissed it as a WH40K-meets-Kult cash grab though I played the miniatures game a couple of times and the Citadel game as well, which I think is considered pretty good even if I didn’t get that at the time. And hey, they made it into a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490181/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1" rel="nofollow noopener">bad movie</a> with Ron Perlman so I guess that’s something. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>I remember Chronopia. Target Games was pretty prominent in Poland back then with Chronopia and (more importantly, I guess) Mutant Chronicles/Doomtrooper. To me Chronopia was just skirmish-level, edgier WH but I had no idea what steampunk was back then so my POV was probably completely bogus.</p>
<p>As for Trudvang - your description of Expert (I assume this indicates DoD Expert or something like that?) rings true to what Trudvang in English is. Again, in places translation makes it hard to grasp what authors mean so it may be better than or worse from what you describe, hard to tell, really. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Oh yeah, Trudvang is a different issue. I should have been clear that I meant the settings made for it before that. The first one, Ereb Altor, was set up as a very standard fantasy world (as far as I know; I never got into it that much since we tended to make up our own settings or play the early published adventures which I think were retrofitted into it later), and Chronopia which came in the early nineties was kind of steampunky IIRC but before steampunk was established in Sweden so it didn’t last very long. After that I lost track until Trudvang showed up, which I haven’t played in but it at least seems different.</p>
<p>I can’t speak to the rules of the later editions (meaning anything after Expert) in detail, but my impression is that they’ve been a bit of a mess. The first (and second, depending on how you count) versions were standard Basic Roleplaying. Expert changed the system to use a d20 instead of a d100 (though it was still roll-under and skill based) and made the skills based on build points rather than ability multipliers, and it vastly expanded the skill list. It also developed the magic system.</p>
<p>After that I mostly lost track but I think they started adding in advantages and other things, and my impression is that it’s been trying to become a different kind of system without being able to shed its BRP roots enough to get there. But that may be an unkind distortion based on the game moving away from what I played when I was young.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that’s what prevented it from catching up. Trudvang has fairly unique Swedish folk setting (unique from my POV at least) and I think there’s a kernel of interesting gameplay hidden somewhere in there. But mechanics as stated are a complete dog and translation is lacking. So, yeah, perhaps it was a fairly generic fantasy <em>game</em> but I don’t think it was a fairly generic <em>fantasy</em>.</p>

              <p>Yeah, Drakar och demoner translates as Dragons and Demons. The name was chosen because it looks similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons and because of the alliteration. (There’s no good Swedish translation for “dungeon” in the D&amp;D sense; the closest is “fängelsehåla” which explicitly and obviously refers to a prison in a way that I don’t think dungeon quite does in English.)</p>
<p>The very first edition of Drakar och Demoner is a translation and development of the then not yet published Magic World expansion for Basic Roleplaying. Later editions moved away from those origins a bit (but not that much) but since it took a long time for it to become anything other than a fairly generic fantasy game the growth potential outside Sweden and the other Nordic countries was fairly small.</p>

Partially out of genuine interest in the topic, but also as a bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing, because even when we all get together just to socialize, we can’t help but end up talking about our work and research and donning our historian hats.</p>
<p>The history talk wouldn’t be the thing hopefully making or breaking their interest in games, because I agree, that probably wouldn’t go over well =P</p>

              <p>When I first reached out to the game studies faculty at my university, I quickly realized that they had knew a good deal about board/card/video games but no one had much experience with RPGs and larp. So I put together a slide deck to, more or less, argue that RPGs and larp were something worth paying attention to and showing them a bunch of ways to tie RPGs/larp into their existing work and interests (e.g. language, culture, literature, education). I spent a slide each on defining RPGs, D&amp;D, a mosaic of notable games from the 80’s/90’s, Designers &amp; Dragons, impact of PDF/POD/croudfunding, and then switched to slides that presented clusters of RPGs around a common theme. I did something similar for larp. I also included slides on relevant texts, journals, conferences, classroom applications, safety, game jams, translation, streaming, etc. So yeah, rather than focusing on their field(s) of study, I focused on their common situation as academics. As far as I can tell, it went over well.</p>

              <p>Wow, no, if I had ten minutes with a group of people who wondered what RPGs were, I’d play a ten minute RPG with them. If somebody says “So what’s bird watching all about?” you don’t regale them with the history of ornithology, you hand them some binoculars. I love the idea of an RPG history lightning talk but that’s for after they are totally hooked.</p>

              <p>Tiny nitpick: It’s “Drakar och demoner”.</p>
<p>I think if you’re going to mention any older Swedish games in this type of quick overview it would be Mutant, as an example of a BRP spinoff and as a distant ancestor of Mutant: Year Zero (which in itself could be an interesting example of a post-PbtA/old school mashup), and Kult.</p>
<p>But even as a Swede who lived through most of the Swedish history of roleplaying games I don’t think it would be necessary to mention any of them.</p>
<p>I do think it would be meaningful to mention the 1980’s drive towards simulationism and point build systems, though. And if you’re doing this for history majors, you’ve got to mention GURPS and its historical supplements.</p>

<p>Edit: I also rather feel like “The History of D&amp;D and TSR” has been written.  It’s there.  The facts are pretty much down. Sure, people can argue about who ousted who, and why, but it’s pretty clear cut in terms of what happened.  Design trends, on the other hand, are a bit more debatable, a bit more fluid, a bit harder to pin down, and make better history.</p>

              <p>I agree that focussing mostly on DnD leaves less room for other systems. But the history of DnD or better of TSR is worth telling. It is full of <em>tragedy</em>.</p>
<p>I do not know if there was any company in the history of the hobby that was as successful and crashed as hard.</p>
<p>The history of DnD is the history of the hobby exemplified, <em>pars pro toto</em>. When WoW impacted DnD sales, it impacted the hobby as a whole.</p>
<p>DnD is not the most important system but it tells the story best.</p>
<p>And even if one does prefer other systems - as I do - one has to acknowledge DnDs place and rank in the history as well as in the present time. Like it or not.</p>

              <p>I’d say historically and still by volume D&amp;D is the “stick everything else has to be measured against”.  D&amp;D is for better or worse the biggest TTRPG and has the strongest claim to being the first.  While there’s been interesting alternatives from the start like Empire of the Petal Throne, and continue to be, it’s still the property that has the largest following and is synonymous with TTRPGs in the public eye.</p>
<p>In our own corners of the hobby this might not seem to be the case, but I think any ‘historical’ discussion of TTRPGs is going to largely be a historical discussion of D&amp;D, to do otherwise would be much like presenting a History of North America that quickly shifted to discuss only Ottawa or Alaska.</p>

This way your audience can pick what slice they find interesting and dig deeper. Focusing mostly on D&amp;D beats like Thomas_Junk did doesn’t do ttrpg justice and may leave an impression that D&amp;D is some sort of stick everything else has to be measured against.</p>
<p>There was a massive shift in the types of games people gravitated towards over the years. These movememts were reaction to open questions such as: how comprehensive the rules should be? is there a difference between player and character? what is the role of GM? who has what kind of agency and when (prep/play)? do we focus on characters, story or world? can we have an universal system or should the subject matter be reflected in game mechanics?</p>
<p>These are the sorts of questions historian would probably ask when looking at a history of, say, Europe and its formation through dynamics between politics, workforce, social structure, etc. Maybe, I’m not a historian. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
