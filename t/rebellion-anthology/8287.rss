    <description>**For the first 24 hours, please sign up only if you&#39;re new to the Gauntlet.**
**I&#39;ve waived the usual RSVP priority period.**

This series of games all have a theme of control and rebellion, but we won&#39;t necessarily frame them all in our contemporary world, and even if we do, we won&#39;t constrain ourselves too closely to events in previous games. 

As such, you aren&#39;t expected to sign up to all three games.

**Be Seeing You**
A roleplaying game about independence, control, freedom and compliance.

This GMless roleplaying game is designed to explore themes around independence, surveillance, freedom and compliance. It is geared towards dystopian science fiction, social allegory, and psychological drama. Games occur within a society that tries to both undermine our sense of self and prevent free collaboration with others. The focus of our story is a person who is in some way trapped, monitored, and expected to conform to a society they are at odds with. 

Influenced by fiction in the vein of The Prisoner, Stalker, and Utopia, and real struggles against mass surveillance, the Hostile Environment, and the alienating effects of capitalism.

[Session 1](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-N8yNT7HDuvIjgc120aP) [date=2022-10-02 time=20:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Dublin&quot;] → [date=2022-10-02 time=23:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Dublin&quot;]

**The Steadfast &amp; The Rebellious**

You are all inhabitants of the city, and you have been living in false peace under the rule of the demon king. The last wall, which offered your city limited protection against the demon king&#39;s tyrannical rule, has now fallen. Citizens are left with two choices; do everything the tyrant demands, or resist. Will we rise victorious against the demon king, or will our resistance be futile? We play to find out.

**Compromise//Empire**

The forces of the Empire, the forces of totalitarianism and exploitation, are invading. They have secured a foothold, and want complete control. Their soldiers trample the land, their spies and diplomats are in your places of power, time is limited.

You represent a faction. One of the factions who are working to resist the Empire. As a representative you must extend a hand and form whatever alliances you can with the other factions at play. Resisting the Empire will cost you, and your faction. Compromises must be made.

What cost will you pay to resist the Empire?
