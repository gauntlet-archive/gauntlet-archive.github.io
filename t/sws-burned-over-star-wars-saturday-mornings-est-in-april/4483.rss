    <description>**Star Wars Saturdays: Burned Over Star Wars**
![](upload://o4mnEWHlfSpe0w1tESuKO0GadcP.gif)

In April, I&#39;m playtesting Burned Over Star Wars. It&#39;s a PbtA Star Wars using tons of AW Burned Over mechanics married with some new stuff, and some pieces borrowed from Star Wars World.

*This is a major hack-up of Star Wars World and Apocalypse World: Burned Over from @William_Nichols and myself. This will be the first playtest of the rules!*

Alun Rees is a special guest for this series.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is after the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.
There will be 3 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools Lines and Veils and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use, as well as post-game feedback after each session.
