    <title>Jeremy Strandberg’s Stonetop: Status?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/jeremy-strandberg-s-stonetop-status/5458</link>
    <description>Does anyone know what the status of @Jeremy_Strandberg’s [Stonetop](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/stonetop.html) is and whether it&#39;s still possible to get playtest or early release versions of it to play?

It looks like Stonetop might be in that creative valley where its mostly done but hasn&#39;t yet made it to the top of [Lampblack &amp; Brimstone&#39;s](https://lampblack-and-brimstone.com) list of projects to publish next.

I&#39;ve googled around before asking but can&#39;t work out or how to get in touch with JS and ask him directly. I know he&#39;s active on here sometimes and I&#39;m guessing some of the playtesters might be too.</description>

              <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/cherry_nick">@Cherry_Nick</a> – Happy to hear you’re interested in the game. <em>Stonetop</em> is in fact at the top of L&amp;B’s project list, and has been for a while. It’s just Jeremy and me and our artist, though, so it’s been taking us a long time to get it into shape. That being said, I can see the Kickstarter launch on the horizon…</p>

              <p>Yeah, we’re totally still taking playtest groups.  I’ve generally been asking groups to commit to playing at least 3 sessions and providing feedback.</p>
<p>If that sounds like you, send me a DM here with your email address, name, pronouns, and any other info you think I should have. I’ll be in touch.</p>
