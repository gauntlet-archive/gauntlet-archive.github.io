    <description>I wanted to do a quick post to let people know that there are free resources available for learning how to use software, graphic and logo design, and so on.

Your library is your best friend! In addition to obviously being able to get books on the various subjects, the most useful thing I found was being able to login to view tutorials on sites like Lynda.com. If you go to your library’s resource page there should be a portal to login with your library card and password.

I learned the basics of InDesign and Illustrator off the site. It helped me out a lot because they’re visual, video tutorials with follow-along documents and resources and they’re always up to date so the videos match the software sitting in front of you. 

As an aside, I started talking about it on Twitter when I saw people getting excited about Apple News, which you also get for free via your library with an app like PressReader. Just thought I’d mention it! 

If anyone else has any good resources please do share!</description>

              <p>I have been collecting a rather large number of resources on my podcast (The RPG Design Panelcast) over the past few years, which might provide some useful information for folks as well. It’s not specific to graphic design, but it is a rather robust set of resources that folks can access for free.
