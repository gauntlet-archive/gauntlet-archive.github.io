    <title>Codex - Void Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-void-miscellany/3460</link>
    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Void. This one is called “Three Dozen Incidents in Degoya County, New Mexico.” Degoya County is located in a remote corner of the state. And it has a bad, bad history. Tell us all about it, please. 

Note: please avoid sexist imagery in your submissions—we don’t publish stuff like that. 

Submissions should be no more than 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Importantly: your submission needs to note the year of the incident, as in the examples below.

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

Here are some examples:

“1956: Two men, Edgar Aguilar and Joey Mathers, enraged with each other about a business deal gone sour, have a standoff in the middle of La Fresca. They stare at each other for nearly three minutes—seething and snorting—before an unidentified woman approaches and gives them each a gun. The woman then walks back to wherever she came from, and the two men shoot each other dead in the street.” 

“1933: The first known appearance of the Big Man—a tall, wide, jowly old man in a cowboy hat and pale yellow suit—at a community picnic, where he can be seen standing in the background of several photos that were taken. No one from that day can recall him, but many folks in Degoya County—right up to the present day—have a story about meeting him. He usually offers witnesses a cigarette and then tells them a little-known secret about the community… just before vanishing completely.” 

“Approximately 690,000 BP: The Great Render of Flesh, pleased with the wanderers for making copious sacrifices of blood and bone before his impossible altar, gifts them with a titanic pillar made of screaming skin, infused with ancient magicks—a weapon they can use to destroy the fire cults once and for all.” 

“1986: The La Fresca Senior High prom ends abruptly when a fire breaks out in the gymnasium the dance is being held in. Over 100 students and teachers lose their lives. Curiously, not all the victims die of burns or smoke inhalation. Several die from blunt force trauma, two from wounds that suggest an animal attack, and one is decapitated.”

              <p>1937: The Degoya County life-size replica of the Biblical Ark was stolen, some say by hand. The reverend William Hendrox started the project in 1931 as a combination charitable works project for migrant labour and demonstration of the glory of God, but by 1937, it was still only a skeleton. Then, in March, a dust storm swept across the whole region, and when it disappeared so too did the Degoya Ark - only the reverend and a dozen or so workers made it out of the site alive, and only one of them wanted to talk about what took the ship away. The reverend praised God; the workers buried him.</p>

Ra-Do-Lyte Curative Mineral Water was its most popular product, and by1926 the bottling plant produced over 75,000 gallons per month. Ra-Do-Lyte went bankrupt in 1930, and its long-abandoned factory was listed as an EPA superfund site in 1982. A 2004 study by the CDC estimates that over 1200 deaths can be linked to ingestion of Ra-Do-Lyte products.</p>

Ramirez said that he was duck-hunting when “the monster swooped out of nowhere and grabbed a bluebill out of the air.” Ramirez says he fired both barrels of his shotgun at the monster, but it was too far away to hit, and that the gunshot “scared it off.” Anyone else who sees this creature is urged to report it to the County Department of Fish and Game.</p>

The Degoya County medical examiner noted that all 19 had the same abstract geometric tattoo on their left shoulders, and that all had high levels of peyote and LSD in their systems. Oddly, nobody ever came forward to claim any of the bodies or their cremains.</p>

The conquistadors slaughtered over 300 men, women, and children. The Spaniards demanded gold from each of the few survivors, and when none was surrendered, they cut off the thumb from both hands.</p>
<p>April 5, 1609: Franciscan missionary Delmonico Castafael records that the Spanish fort once located in what is now Canby Memorial Park was attacked at night by an unknown number of “savages”, killing everyone inside. The friar noted that both thumbs of every Spanish soldier were missing. Strangely, no gunfire was heard at the nearby mission house, nor were there any signs of a raiding party’s approach or departure.</p>

<p>Strange reports from witnesses claim a great beast tore apart one of the tourists at The Cowboy Skeet Club in the ghost town retreat of Gallop, New Mexico.  According to witnesses, a regular at the club, Jeff Binsum, hit a huge beast just beyond the range with his shotgun shell.  In response, the “monster” as one witness called it, instantly disappeared and reappeared in front of them, dragging off Jeff into the nearby desert where his body was later found.</p>
