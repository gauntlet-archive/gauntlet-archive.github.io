Hello! I&#39;ve just launched a Kickstarter for a game based on FLCL. It&#39;s been a passion project of mine that I&#39;ve been developing for about a year and a half. To be clear, this game is **not** trying to be ***FLCL*** . It&#39;s my effort to create a rule set that would communicate what I felt it was about.

*Never Knows Best* is about teens struggling to discover their identity while grappling with what it means to &quot; **grow up** &quot; in a world where society imposes expectations and rules that are counterproductive and, sometimes, absurd.

The rules of this game **literalizes** this by making the **inner turmoil** the teens struggle with on a daily basis something **real** and **tangible** . Those thoughts and emotions and pressures become strange, **absurd creatures** ordinary kids wouldn&#39;t be able to combat. But *these* teenagers **transform into their robot selves** to take them on, embodying their inner strength.</description>
