    <title>Pokémon Rescue Team</title>

    <description>These are three connected sessions, each scheduled for 3 hours. Attendance of all three sessions is fun, but not mandatory. You have to RSVP to each session you want to join.

In a world where humans don&#39;t exist, Pokémon have built a civilization for themselves. They live in small towns spread across the world, and rely on each other to get by. Some of them dedicate themselves to helping the community by facing threats and braving the wilderness to save Pokémon who are in danger. They are the rescue teams.

This will be a short campaign based on the world of the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, where we&#39;ll tell the story of brave, small Pokémon who are rookies in a rescue team. The system is a very light-weight hack of World of Dungeons which you can check out [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8ppQ_9DUzpltDWUXlibxkrp2cmJhL9ZRfBLiSGY_uA/edit?usp=sharing).

No knowledge of the Pokémon franchise is required.

The X-card will be used, and we will be observing the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
