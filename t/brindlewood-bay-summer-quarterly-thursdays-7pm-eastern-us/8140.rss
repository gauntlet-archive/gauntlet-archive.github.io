    <description>*For the first 72 hours please only sign up if you have joined the Gauntlet in the last year or if you have not played Brindlewood Bay before.*

 

**Brindlewood Bay**  is a tabletop roleplaying game that combines  *Murder, She Wrote*  with H.P. Lovecraft. In it, you play a group of elderly women, members of the local Murder Mavens Mystery Book Club, who help the authorities solve murder cases in a picturesque New England Town. Over the course of their investigations, they become aware of a dark occult conspiracy that connects the cases, and will eventually have to face that conspiracy in order to save their community. 

**Series Structure**

12 Thursdays in July, August, and September 7:00-10:00 US Eastern Time

While this series will be structured as a campaign, it will be explicitly open-table. Each mystery will be set up as a 2-shot so that folks can drop in and out. This means that we will push to resolve each mystery in 2 sessions. Returning Mavens will keep their advancements, cozy little place, and conditions. The Dark Conspiracy will continue to progress as void clues are revealed, regardless of which Mavens are present. I will also accelerate the Dark Conspiracy a bit to fit the schedule.

 

**To facilitate this the sessions will be labeled 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and so on…**

During &quot;A&quot; sessions, we will introduce any new Mavens and set up a new mystery.

During &quot;B&quot; sessions, we will continue from the previous session and solve a mystery.

There&#39;s no obligation to sign up for the full series, but if you can sign up for a linked pair of A and B sessions, that is a big help.

**Schedule:**

Mystery 1: July 7th and 14th

Mystery 2: July 21st and 28th

Mystery 3: August 4th and 11th

Mystery 4: August 18th and 25th

Mystery 5: September 8th and 15th

Mystery 6: September 22nd and 29th (Dark Conspiracy)

There is no session September 1st.

I will send reminders 1 week before the session

**CW:**  Possible themes include aging, gentrification, the occult, murder, light body horror, creepy occult activity

**System**  : Brindlewood Bay (rules will be taught)

**Duration**  : 3 Hours

**Breaks**  : 2 breaks per session, approximately on the hour, 5-10 minutes each,

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : No

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
