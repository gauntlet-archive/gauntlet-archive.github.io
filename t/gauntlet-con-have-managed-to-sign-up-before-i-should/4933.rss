    <title>Gauntlet Con - have managed to sign up before I should</title>

    <description>hello - hope this is the right place for this. I followed the Patreon link to the Gauntlet Con sign up page, and it looks like I&#39;ve managed to sign up for a game ahead of when I should be able to. Can&#39;t see how to remove myself, sorry. Can someone with the right permissions throw me out of the Annalise game, please? (I will be back Monday to sign up again, once things are formally open and I&#39;m not jumping the gun.)</description>
