    <description>Hello everybody,
I’m looking for games with a dice qualitative element.
What I mean as a „qualitative”?
In traditional games, when you roll the dice, you want to answer the question „does my character succeed in doing their task”. Sometimes, when you roll particular result, you have extraordinary success, great defeat. In Numenera, when you roll „1”, Game Master introduces free GM’s intrusion.

But I’m looking for games, in which a specific result adds something in the fiction, independently of Game Master and players.
Something like fate cards in Archipelago - „Yes, but you earn a new enemy”.
Or like „Alone in the Stars”, where a specific card tells you what happened.

Can you recommend me any titles?</description>

              <p>Heriwr is an old project of mine which uses custom story dice. The story dice mechanic was borrowed from The Legend of the Five Rings by Fantasy Flight. It’s a Celtic inspired AGON playset.</p>
<p>The dice in the system use custom symbols but translate to Success, Conflict, Opportunity and Explosive. The dice have no numerical value but the number of sides the dice have increases as you improve your stats. If one of your dice results in opportunity you can add a story element to the narrative. If your die results in conflict something goes wrong and you gain a wound. An explosive die result allows you to roll again.</p>
<p>The system itself changes some of the elements of AGON and adds a Familiar as an extra die to add to the pool.</p>
<p>I didn’t end up continuing with this project, I playtested it once and moved on to storygames and token mechanics but I’m happy to discuss how it works.</p>

              <p>The symbols/runes could be thematic for the world (law vs chaos, specific gods or themes), the campaign or even the individual story… allowing you to skew the narrative choices for individual sessions or characters. Maybe you unlock special symbols on the dice later on in the story… there seem to be quite a bit of design space that can be explored.</p>
<p>I don’t know Genesys at all. Can you tell me about what they do that?</p>

<p>That also sounds like the Genesys systems. I love Star Wars games (who doesn’t?!) but the system with all their funny dice just was a non-starter for me.<br>
Although, your idea now gives me visions of drawing strange runes on my dice by connecting the pips, and that makes me want to reach for my sharpie LOL <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Each “move” that requires rolling the dice (let’s say for physical, mental and social risk) has a lookup table where different combos of symbols give different qualitative results. You can roll the dice, keep some and roll again. The number of rerolls could depend from skill or difficulty.</p>

              <p><em>Swords Without Master</em> shifts the traditional narrative of die rolls, where success/failure is secondary to the roll. You roll two dice, each associated with a tone, and the higher die determines the tone of whatever you do. Most of the time, you also have say over how successful the action is–but most actions don’t even think about that dichotomy, instead it’s focused on the expression of your action, and most actions you take don’t fall cleanly into either success or failure.</p>

              <p>The 2017 (Mongoose) edition of <em>Paranoia</em> adds a special die to every die pool where if you roll a certain result, it means the Computer involves itself in the situation, but how it involves itself is basically up to the GM.</p>
<p>Is that the kind of thing you’re looking for, or no? It feels similar to the <em>Numenera</em> GM Intrusion (and I’d think the same about the <em>In Nomine</em> special rolls, too, for example), but the original question made it sound like a GM Intrusion is <strong>not</strong> an example of what you’re talking about? Is that right?</p>

              <p>Adding content according to success is the unspoken rule behind FitE rolls (notably “spicy dice” play), and a feature of FitM.</p>
<p>You don’t want to have it on a regular basis as in Otherkind (tracking dice variant), then limit it with, say Fate points (which is how I would do it).<br>
You want it to be</p>
<ul>
<li>rare, like the In Nomine example, only with prompts that don’t describe success but other content (how many, how much detailed, plot twist, characters, places, items, “aspects” ?)</li>
<li>varying in degrees “on a (uncommon result) add important details. On a (rare result) add a scene changing element”.</li>
<li>decoupled from success but depending on the same randomizer , such as roll “width”, sequences (1-2, 2-3, etc.), odd/even, or poker combinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>*** edit : more brain juice ***<br>
Some card-based games do this with heigth / combination for success and suit / arcana for content : James Mullen’s <a href="https://groundhoggth.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-leviathan-manifesto.html#more">Leviathan manifesto</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/radmad">@Radmad</a> 's Hesitation at the Gate, <a class="mention" href="/u/deckard">@Deckard</a> 's Leadtown, and probably others (Matt Snyder’s Dust devils ?)</p>
<p>Another solution to assess would be content invoked through stats and stakes, like in Jacob Randolph’s Law’s out ?</p>
<p>Personnaly, I’d insist for the randomness to be tempered by an (advantage) token mechanism, such as Technoir’s Push dice.</p>

In Nomine has 111 and 666 invoke gods.<br>
Many PbtA moves, most notably perception moves (seclusium of Orphone style) have prompts to introduce content.<br>

It looks like you want to unload the burden on players for content generation. And you’re ready to go with Tarot procedure : general prompts that players paint by numbers. Descended for the Queen games. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtZYuGYAemvBN9Y0WImvQHnLcTUigKazM8MO4lLQ7Yo/edit">Prompt</a>, a RPG. Then the number of “categories” you are going to play with is critical for the precision/replay value balance. Good / bad doesn’t satisfy you. Can you give us a range ?</p>
<p>And of course, Otherkind dice when you keep track of where dice come from and go to : that informs quite precisely what is happening. Star Wars So and So the RPG is a limited version of that with proprietary dice.</p>

              <p>Hello everybody,<br>
I’m looking for games with a dice qualitative element.<br>
What I mean as a „qualitative”?<br>
In traditional games, when you roll the dice, you want to answer the question „does my character succeed in doing their task”. Sometimes, when you roll particular result, you have extraordinary success, great defeat. In Numenera, when you roll „1”, Game Master introduces free GM’s intrusion.</p>
<p>But I’m looking for games, in which a specific result adds something in the fiction, independently of Game Master and players.<br>
Something like fate cards in Archipelago - „Yes, but you earn a new enemy”.<br>
Or like „Alone in the Stars”, where a specific card tells you what happened.</p>
<p>Can you recommend me any titles?</p>
