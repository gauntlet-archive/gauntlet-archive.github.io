**A Long Night In The Mech Bay**

In an ever shifting war that has spread to the entire Merseus System, the Roran Federation&#39;s Ace Pilot has barely escaped from their life from a recent incident. Sadly, there is no time to rest for the pilot or their mechanic. This Mech needs to be ready to fight tomorrow and no one else is available to help. It’s going to be a long night.

**Remember Me**

Remember Me is a two player game exploring the role of memory in our identities, specifically the memories others have of us. Players take on the roles of two people who have and may still care deeply for one another, who describe the other through a memory. They listen, ask questions, and fully flesh out the memory before the listener decides if they believe their companion and integrate the memory, or if they reject it.

**The Sailor and the Siren**

One of you will play the Sailor: dashing, human, and foolish. Will you survive the Siren, or fall prey to her whims?
The other will play the Siren: beautiful, inhuman, and hungry. Will you fall in love with the Sailor, or give in to your hunger and kill them? Perhaps both?

**A Duet of Steel**

Throughout your life, throughout generations of your family, throughout the various fronts of your war, you have had one great rival. Again and again you clash with them, one walking away the victor of the battle, but bearing the scars of your war.

<p>Heaven Nor Hell is a game for two or more players where you play otherworldly immortal beings split across heaven and hell. There are three things that you know:<br>
• You love each other<br>
• The powers that be most definitely wouldn’t approve of your relationship<br>
• There is only one place that is safe to meet: Earth Together, tell the story of your relationship over the eons, stolen away in hidden moments.</p>
