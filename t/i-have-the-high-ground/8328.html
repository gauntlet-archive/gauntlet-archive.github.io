          <p>I Have The High Ground is a collaborative two-player duelling game of banter, posturing and capes by Jess Levine. The game is not an action-packed fight to the death—though that might occur in the battle which follows your duel—but rather a portrayal of the smoldering tension between two individuals about to risk their pride, their reputation, or<br>
even their lives.</p>
<p>No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play.</p>
<p>Subject matter in the game includes violence and the threat of violence, and potentially flirtatious banter. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door. The game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>I’ve scheduled 3 hours to make sure we have enough time, but I expect we’ll finish closer to 2 hours. We’ll play over Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. I won’t record the session.</p>
<p>I’ll email a week before the session to confirm attendance and share play materials.</p>
<p>Open access time for sign ups is 1pm 23rd August AEST.</p>
