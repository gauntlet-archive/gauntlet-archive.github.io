_An optimistic person might call this place a town. It has a name. It just doesn&#39;t have many people. Which makes these other losers who are still hanging around important. They&#39;re the folks you see every day, the people you work with, the people you drink with at the bar. &quot;Friends&quot; might be a stretch, but like it or not, they&#39;ve known you forever. They know all the stupid things you&#39;ve done. Maybe it&#39;s been weeks, maybe decades, but they won&#39;t let you forget. Nobody gets a blank slate here._

_Unincorporated_ is a GMless story game about ordinary people caught up in petty dramas, long-standing grudges, and hopeless love affairs, under the weight of reputations and baggage they&#39;re trying to shake off.

**This is a playtest of a very rough draft, so expect some hitches and on-the-fly rule adjustments!**
