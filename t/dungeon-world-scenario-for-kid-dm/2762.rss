    <title>Dungeon World Scenario for Kid DM</title>

    <description>Hi Friends!

For game night, we had a dozen people over, many new to RPGs, to spread the joy of the hobby. My eight-year-old wanted to run a table of Dungeon World, so together we wrote a little scenario, about a local wedding gone awry. After working with him on the plot and the NPCs, I wrote up this little guide to help him at the table. 

I share it here in case you have a young person wanting to try their hand at running an adventure.

              <p>Hearing about kids playing and running RPGs is always interesting. How did he (or will he) answer those questions? I wonder what the experience was like for him.</p>
<p>I was a shy kid who was thrown by circumstances into the GM seat with group of friends when I was around age 9 or 10, and it transformed me quite dramatically.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the interest! He ran it last Friday for our game night. I need to get a full report from my (adult) friend who played a Cleric (I was running a different table).</p>
<p>From what I could glean, my kid hurried to Scene 3 (the dragon) because that was probably the most interesting for an 8-year-old. I did coach him to let the players feel the tension in Scene 2, but in the heat of the moment I doubt that meant anything to him.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges he faced: two players were new to RPGs; one player was experienced but a “murderhobo.” My adult friend reports that despite all this, my kid did great.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I wish I would have recorded it, so I could hear for myself how he handled things at the table.</p>
<p>I will ask him:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did he use the prompts?</li>
<li>Is there anything he would change about the scenario?</li>
<li>What was the most difficult part of being a DM?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for the interest!</p>
