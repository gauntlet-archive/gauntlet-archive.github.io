    <title>Guantlet Hangouts Lower 3rds Using OBS</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve used OBS to adjust my video and add overlays in games. It is a technique I learned on The Gauntlet G+. I wanted to document it here it so other folks can do it too! These sorts of overlays are useful in games so you can display your character name, pronouns and other information directly on stream! I&#39;ve also used OBS to up my camera contrast for Noir games and get more of that pulpy feel.
* OBS for those not familiar is [Open Broadcaster Studio](https://obsproject.com/), it is a free cross-platform way to record video from your computer and stream (often used for Twitch) and required for this tutorial.
* The trick to this is a plugin for OBS called [virtual-cam](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam/releases) ⬅ You can download the installer here, if you have OBS it the installer should do the rest. Unfortunately the plug-in is Windows (7, 8, 10) only.
* Once installed you can view your webcam in OBS by adding a &quot;Video Capture Device&quot; as a source and selecting WEB CAMERA.
* Before joining a Hangouts game fire up OBS, make sure VirtualCam is running with Tools ➡ VirtualCam ➡ Start (or check the AutoStart checkbox)
* When Joining a Hangouts game make sure the camera input is OBS-Camera (you can adjust this by clicking the gear icon). Also know that your video will look mirrored to you so text won&#39;t be readable to you but it will be for everyone else.

I may make a video or take photos of this process to make it clearer (and there is interest).</description>

              <p>That sounds great. I always think about doing something like this, and some tutorials, especially if you’re able to do screenshots or video would be great!</p>
