    <title>Character Keeper for Stonetop - does one exist?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/character-keeper-for-stonetop-does-one-exist/7268</link>
    <description>I&#39;m preparing to run a Stonetop campaign, and quite excited about it. However, of course, we are playing online. 

In the past, @Jeremy_Strandberg has been tremendously good at making character keepers and play aids for online play. 

I wonder: does that exist for Stonetop, in its present form? If you know of such a thing, or have made one, please do share with us here!

Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>Thanks! That’s lovely.</p>
<p>I ended up joining the Discord and finding both the Keepers. There’s also a Virtual Tabletop for Foundry in the works, but that’s not something I’m willing to pay for.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether they are intended for public consumption, so I won’t post the link to Jim’s here (he is welcome to do so himself, if he wants, of course!), but it’s really nice. I would say it’s less “fancy” than the one above in terms of presentation, but does have data indexes and drop-down menus for moves and such, which is more accessible for people who don’t know the rules or struggle with copying and pasting into spreadsheets (which is most regular humans!).</p>
<p>Thanks for the swift reply! Much appreciated.</p>

<p>I also think <a class="mention" href="/u/jimlikesgames">@JimLikesGames</a> was working on a fancier one too, but I don’t know if he finished it.</p>
