<p>This time around with no fewer than 13 roleplaying games in English, with one of those coming from Germany.<br>
<b>Aces in Space</b> is a project done by Christian Vogt and his teams. The setting has the players assume the role of daring space pilots and is somewhere between Battlestar Galactica and Sons of Anarchy with some Social Media elements thrown into the mix. The whole presentation is, imho, so brilliant that I backed it, despite my personal aversion towards Fate Core. Another cool setting that does tempt me a lot is <b>Heart: The City Beneath</b> by Grant Howitt. The Deep Apiarist with its swarms of bees caught my eye and has me enticed. The system of the games is inspired or rather based on the one in The Spire and those who back it get a quickstarter upon pledging. <b>10 Workers United</b> isn’t a phantastical game but highlights the necessity of unions. The zine is a direct reaction towards Kickstarter firing workers who claim they got the boot because they tried to unionized. I backed it. If your more interested in spies and villains with super powers, you should take a look at <b>CAPERS Covert</b>. The charming setting is supported by the tried and tested card based system of CAPERS and CAPERS Noire. I am considering to back it about as much as I am considering backing <b>PunkApocalyptic</b>. The newest game by the creator of Shadows of the Demon Lord as a cool, punkrock take on the Apocalyptic genre and is, as stated, quite tempting. If you like your alternative reality less punk like and less apocalyptic, maybe take a look at the fantasy system offered by <b>Gaval Tales</b>.<br>
Back to the apocalypse, there’s <b>Libreté</b>. The games is a continuitation of the French game Perdu sous la Pluie (Lost under the Rain), and one does play lost childred. The system is a unique take on the Powered by the Apocalypse system and I do feel enticed. Another PbtA game, yet without the apocalypse, is <b>Root</b>. Based on the board game by the same name gamers will play little mice and other animals who brave adventures. <b>Under Hollow Hills</b> by Meguey and Vincent Baker isn’t particularly dark either as it focusses it’s setting on a traveling circus aiming, from what I feel, to be accessible by younger players.<br>
Then there are quite some d10 based games. Like <b>Deviant: The Renegades</b>, the newest gameline by Onyx Path to be added to the Chronicles of Darkness. The players play creatures or people who’ve been created to fight the various supernatural forces of the CofD, yet turned on their creators. Which is more interesting than I gave the first pitches credit for. <b>Scouts of the Wyrdwood Forest</b> on the other hand is a rather colorful game, in which the players try to explore some mystical woods. Where as <b>Era: Forbidden</b> focuses on the conflict between Angels and Demons using the solid game engine of other Era-games. Last but not least <b>SLA Industries</b> will get a second edition in which players have to deal with a futuristic yet dystopian city and its strange inhabitants.<br>
Next to those cool games, which really put me under the agony of choice, there are plenty more, fascinating, worthwile projects. Just take a look:</p>
