    <description>[Compendium classes in question.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BnrryHnxgMf-XkNobANxI2l6ERhcDj6R/view)

First off, really sorry if this isn&#39;t the right spot for this topic, I am just a basic badge baby.

Anyway, it&#39;s pretty much the title. Doing my first Dungeon World campaign (Loosely based on Keep on the Borderlands). Everybody is having a great time, I mostly just got the urge to make stuff, and I feel like I had some good ideas.

I should mention that I tried to tailor this to my player&#39;s tastes: they like utility and they really like high risk high reward play.</description>

              <p>Thanks. Turf and Evil Eye are the ones I had the most concerns about largely for the reasons you mentioned. This will be a lot of help going in to the second draft.<br>
Also made me realize I had a disturbing lack of cat puns.</p>

              <p>A few vague thoughts, perhaps something useful for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Turf</em> may be a per-session move, but you should still give it a trigger condition like <em>at the start of a session…</em> also the double roll is a little clunky - rather than making it a +CHA roll for income and then a second for complication you could have something like “name some goods or services you wish to obtain by menace ( or simply state you intend to earn cash ) and roll +CHA. On a success you gain the goods or the number you rolled*10 coin.  On a 7-9 pick one…” followed by your list of complications. I would also suggest that if it has not been rolled for three weeks consecutively, control of the turf will be lost.</li>
<li>
<em>Consigliere</em> reads to me like a GM interaction rather than a move.</li>
<li>In the <em>Familiar</em> description I read “cantrip” as “catnip” and now I think the familiar should refer to them that way.</li>
<li>
<em>Evil Eye</em> is a one-hit kill in a lot of cases with relatively little downside. I would perhaps adjust to “the affliction lasts a minute or until the target takes damage.”</li>
<li>
<em>The Fugitive</em> - If this is a compendium class it drop the “somewhere in your backstory” -  compendium classes are the consequence of events that come up in play, otherwise you’re just dealing with a standard playbook.</li>
</ul>
