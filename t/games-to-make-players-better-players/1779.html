<p>And by better player my meaning is partially to break habits like optimization and combat focus that 5e embed in players. One thing I‚Äôve experienced when trying to get my game group to play Blades in the Dark or a PBtA game is they approach them the same way they would D&amp;D and have a hard time adjusting, which makes for a frustrating game.</p>
<p>Alongside this what games do people recommend for nurturing more improv ability? A complaint one of my player‚Äôs makes is that they would love to play a RPG with a rich setting, but feel that they couldn‚Äôt do the setting justice and feel like they‚Äôre letting the game down because they don‚Äôt have the imaginative chops.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôd maybe go for something like Microscope or (to a slightly lesser extent) Kingdom to get them out of the mindset of playing from behind a single character‚Äôs eyes? Kind of a ripping off the plaster approach, but the games make it basically impossible to fall into the ‚Äúbad habits‚Äù from D&amp;D. Also, they work perfectly for one-shots, so even if they don‚Äôt get the most enjoyment out of the game, they‚Äôre not committing to X sessions of it.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> Also, it may help assuage the fears of your player who doesn‚Äôt feel like they could improv a rich setting</p>

          <p>A couple of things that have had success in some degree or another for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>imagination issues: warm ups help, as do safety tools. And, I like to emphasize that only what happens at the table is Canon, that this is our story. We may start with discworld or whatever, but it is only what happens at the table that matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last is freeing, as it makes it clear we are not bound by what‚Äôs in the setting book. We serve no masters.</p>
<p>Regarding the mentality: Many many words have been written on this. the Forge had so much advice about exactly this. I got out of that headspace thanks to fiasco, but I‚Äôve also seen that backfire. Heh, monsterhearts is always a fun way to go - go ahead, try to optimize being a teenager.</p>
<p>Some thoughts. Others with have better ones.</p>

          <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jtreat3">@jtreat3</a>‚Äôs <em>Strange Gravity</em>. Full stop. I had the pleasure of playing this in person back in January with <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/yoshi">@yoshi</a>,  <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/mxh">@mxh</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/xaithegamer">@xaithegamer</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/ari_tobias">@Ari_Tobias</a>, and others. As soon as we were done we were trying to figure out how we could run it online. (It is designed as a LARP.) The reason being that we saw how clearly it taught so many amazing habits.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs basically a game to play something like <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Firefly</em>. Everyone has a role they play (Captain, XO, Counselor, Diplomat, Warrior, Pilot, etc.). But those roles also are the division of labor vis-a-vis meta responsibility. So the Captain is in charge of the main arc of the story, the XO is the one who frames scenes, the Counselor can at any point say who characters have relationships with, the Diplomat is the only one who can bring in NPCs, the Pilot is in charge of pacing and moving the ship from location to location (ie if the role isn‚Äôt in play the story will be focused on one location). My favorite teaching part is that the majority of the roles basically require you to interrupt the action to do the required meta thing.</p>
<p>Normally, we tend to be against interruptions and tend to find people who interrupt in games annoying or rude. But this teaches you to interrupt when you feel it is necessary. The reason I see this as being really important to learn is that it applies directly to safety. I think many people end up not activating a safety tool because they don‚Äôt want to interrupt. This game helps you get over that hesitation to interrupt if it is important.</p>
<p>To be honest we thought it might even be a fantastic starter game for introducing people to the Gauntlet and our play culture. It was really that good.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôve found GMless games that put players into roles that ask questions of the world and each other the most powerful tools there. Games that require you to have a little creative pressure, but have that guided like for the queen, the quiet year card, and the king is dead.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôll second <em>Strange Gravity</em>, which very cleverly apportions meta-tasks in a way that makes them very obvious, and can be hugely instructive.</p>
<p>I think <em>Archipelago III</em> is a great game for teaching and honing skills in a trusting group. Its ritual phrases mechanize the sort of kind prosocial feedback loop you see informally at the tightest, best tables.</p>

          <p>I definitely saw a few things click over for players when I ran Dread at a convention.  The questionnaires opened up some ways for them to look at characters.<br>
Question:  ‚ÄúWhy does you hate your job?‚Äù<br>
Player: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my job?‚Äù<br>
Me:  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs your character.‚Äù</p>
<p>I‚Äôve found that games that de-emphasize the mechanics help.  When I‚Äôve had people doing PbtA games for the first time, getting them not to worry about the moves and just let me activate them as they go helps.  GMless games or games that involve Troupe Style play (Thank you, Ars Magica) have also opened up some wonderful things for players.</p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jmstar">@Jmstar</a> mentioned‚Äìimprov classes help.  I‚Äôm a bit prejudiced but I‚Äôd especially recommend something more long form oriented.  A good improv class will start off with character/scene work but I‚Äôve seen people who were trained to play gamey improv that find themselves stuck pretty quickly.</p>

<p>And by better player my meaning is partially to break habits like optimization and combat focus that 5e embed in players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My preference in RPGs matches your own, strongly. I prefer getting deeply into character and focusing on the story. But it‚Äôs important to remember that is not The Correct Way and doesn‚Äôt make me a better player in any measure beyond myself. Lots of players play D&amp;D (etc) because they enjoy character-build optimization, puzzle solving, and/or efficient combat. None of them are wrong, and none of that makes them bad players or worse players, it just means we enjoy different things.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can play together, focus on different things, and all have fun. Sometimes not so much. And sometimes, I can try a bit of their chocolate and enjoy it, and they can try a bit of my peanut butter and enjoy it. While I will always try to share what‚Äôs fun to me with others, I endeavor to remind myself that my playstyle is not better than anyone else‚Äôs, and that judging another player‚Äôs ‚Äòskill‚Äô at a game is productive for no one. (I definitely did that as a teenager, and goodness am I cringing now.)</p>

<p>Thanks for saying this. One of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù players I‚Äôve ever played with, as in, made every table they were at a total blast, did a lot of optimizing and efficient combat. I firmly believe that players of PCs have as much a role in making a game enjoyable as GMs do, but being good at the mechanical aspects of the game doesn‚Äôt get in the way of that. (And, for certain games and playstyles, really helps.)</p>
