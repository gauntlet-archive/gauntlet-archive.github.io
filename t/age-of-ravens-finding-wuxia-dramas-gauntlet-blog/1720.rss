    <description>Today&#39;s post links to *Hearts of Wulin*. I take a brief look at key sources for martial action stories. If you&#39;ve never heard of Jin Yong, Gu Long or Liang Yusheng but you like wuxia movies and stories, odds are pretty good you&#39;ve seen an adaptation of one of their novels. In particular I love the long form TV dramas. These series have their roots in this earlier lit from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, but have also seen a rise in adaptations of contemporary novels and stories.

In the post I provide some suggested series as well as places you can track down these shows. If you&#39;ve watched any and have particular favorites, please post in the comments.</description>

              <p>That’s my take, too. Folks who like wuxia will probably enjoy it quite a bit, but there’s enough about it that’s quintessentially <em>American</em>, most pointedly its invocation of the pre-Bellum South, that it only maps part-way. It’s definitely a hoot, though.</p>

              <p>Only watched the first episode, but I’ve followed some things about it. I’d call it martial action, but I’m not sure I’d use the term wuxia. So can’t fully say. For a show which combines wuxia with modern monster hunting, there’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/EP-2/dp/B07FSD1GYL/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?crid=U3RBXTHA0NZV" rel="nofollow noopener">Rakshasa Street</a></em>.  It’s based on a Chinese manhau (and also had an anime adaptation).</p>

              <p>Out of curiosity, do you consider stories such as “into the badlands” to be Wuxia and is there any asian fiction that mix genres like this that may be a source of stories and setting for Hearts of Wulin?</p>
