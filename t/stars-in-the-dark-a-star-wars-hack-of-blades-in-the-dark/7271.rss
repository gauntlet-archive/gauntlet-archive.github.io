    <description>*Level 1313 on Coruscant is infamous for rampant crime and corruption, a truly prefidious hive of scum and villainy.*

*That&#39;s where you grew up.*

*But not the good part of 1313, where crime brings in stacks of credits, notoriety, and that certain kind of glamour that comes with being a dashing rogue.*

*No, you grew up in the bad part of 1313. The part where a scavenged blaster that can maybe fire three shots before it needs to be recharged is a treasure, where anyone would stab their best friend for a hot meal and a bed for the night, where the dream is to catch a glimpse of the stars through the shaft that lets the lucky few pilot their ships up, out, and away from the crowded squats, the stink, and the eternal, oppressing darkness.*

*But perhaps there is hope. Perhaps with the right friends - or if not friends, at least compatriots - you can find a way to avoid dying facedown in the gutter from a vibroknife stab wound because someone liked the look of your boots. Perhaps...*

This is a game of Blades in the Dark lightly reskinned for Star Wars. This initial run is for four sessions of three hours each, with the first one likely to be mostly character and crew creation, but if everything holds together it may turn into a continuing series. There is no need to commit to that now, though it is preferable if you can attend all four sessions. You must RSVP for each session you wish to attend. A seat has been saved for Rich Rogers.

**For the first 48 hours, please only sign up if you have run a game for me.** This is my way of thanking those who have made me feel so welcome here at the Gauntlet.

We will use lines and veils, the X-card, and the open door policy. [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in effect.

However, it should be noted that the player characters are not expected to be good people. This is a game about criminals doing crimes for money, and while we will steer clear of any subject matter that is uncomfortable for anyone at the table, it&#39;s important to be aware of the fact that these people are not heroes.

It&#39;s possible that these sessions will be recorded, but if they are they will only be made public with the explicit consent of everyone involved.
