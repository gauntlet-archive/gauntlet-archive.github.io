    <description>***This game is about being trans, and explicitly invites people who aren’t trans to play, but for the first 48 hours, please only sign up if you identify as trans or gender nonconforming. I also have a space reserved, so if you’re a trans player who doesn’t have priority sign-up or otherwise misses out, please message me to take the spot.***

The Girlfriend Of My Girlfriend Is My Friend is a diceless game by Stargazersasha “about the magical, hilarious disaster of being trans and a young adult”. It is a low-key, slice of life game about young adult drama that features the most incredible selection of playbooks I’ve ever seen, including The Trans Girl Who’s Really Into Architecture, The Werewolf Who I Smoked With That One Time Who Is Really Cool Actually, Those Two Goths, Spike, and more. I am honestly just so obsessed with the game’s voice, it’s really vibrant and sharp and hilarious in ways I don’t think I’ve seen before.

This game is largely lighthearted but can include heavier themes, including transphobia and other kinds of oppression, suicidal ideation, and includes references to complicated romantic entanglements, sex and drug use. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door as safety tools, and we’ll play using the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

We’ll be playing over Streamyard, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll send an email about a week before the first session to share play materials, confirm attendance, etc. I’ll ask if it’s okay to record and share the sessions, and will only do so with consent from all players.

Open access time for sign-ups is 6.30pm 5 October AEDT.
