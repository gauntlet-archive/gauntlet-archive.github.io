    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/07/11/crowdfunding-collection-174/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #174, including every tabletop rpg project started between 06/27 and 07/11&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Having had to pause last week, I managed to scrap a bit of time together, to get it done this one. Still, my small prelude, might be shorter than usual.

Let’s start with &lt;b&gt;GhastBashers&lt;/b&gt;. A game in which you catch ghosts, ghostbuster style, using a narrative d12 system. Fans of superheroes get a D&amp;D 5E ruleset based game with &lt;b&gt;Capes &amp; Crooks&lt;/b&gt;. If you like to design your own setting, you should check out &lt;b&gt;Anyworld Tabletop Roleplaying System&lt;/b&gt;. Next to the rules required, it offers introductionary scenarios for quite some genre.
Fans of the old tentacled creature, can face him with &lt;b&gt;Cursed Captains of Cthulhu&lt;/b&gt; swashbuckling style. Which is a somewhat fresh approach with a 4d6 based system. Those who prefer Cthulhu like it’s been done in the past, can get their serving of &lt;b&gt;Call of Cthulhu Classic&lt;/b&gt; from Chaosium.
The &lt;b&gt;HYPERBOREA 3E&lt;/b&gt; kickstarter aims to finance the new edition of the famous fantasy rpg, with quite some fans and thus funding already. &lt;b&gt;Chromatic Dungeons&lt;/b&gt; appears to be a reaction to the current „new TSR controversy“, and uses a diverse set of creators to offer an OSR game with modern sensibilities in mind – basically aiming to actively include people. Then there is &lt;b&gt;Highcaster&lt;/b&gt;, aiming to enable the players to shape up legends, using the „Caster System“ as previously seen in ttrpgs like The Great American Novel and The Great American Witch. &lt;b&gt;Peace the RPG&lt;/b&gt; might not look much, going by the thumbnail, yet the project offers a broad and interesting looking description. I do recommend having a look. Then there is &lt;b&gt;Fate of Dungeons&lt;/b&gt;, a game that aims to offer a fates based old school rpg. Sounds strange? Yet, it is what the pitch says.
If you like narrative games in the style of Fate and Numenera, and mechas, you got to take a look at &lt;b&gt;The Tears of a Machine&lt;/b&gt;. If it weren’t for the system used, I would have backed it, as I quite like the theme. &lt;b&gt;MEGALOS: Aetherological Crystalpunk&lt;/b&gt; sorts itself into the Science Fantasy genre and uses a narrative d20 system. For more infos, check out the project.
I am quite tempted to back the solo ttrpg &lt;b&gt;Dwelling: A Solo Game for Ghosts&lt;/b&gt;. I like the horror theme, the exploration of a haunted house, and the interaction with the titular ghosts. Plus, its the first solo game, that I noticed, which features Safety Tools. Very cool! Then there is the solo game &lt;b&gt;Adventure Squared&lt;/b&gt;. You get a solo ttrpg, journaling game and create maps. Three things in one project.
Last but not least we get to the gamebook category, in which we find &lt;b&gt;Chasing Tail&lt;/b&gt;. A game in which one – as a furry – chases the tails of other furrys, and might engage in fun times. Which is why it has the „mature audience“ labe. Facinating.
Next to all those projects, there are the &lt;b&gt;Deadly Skull Dice &amp; Sunken Skull Resin Dice&lt;/b&gt;.
You’ll find these, and many more projects, here:
