          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2021/07/11/crowdfunding-collection-174/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #174, including every tabletop rpg project started between 06/27 and 07/11</b></a>.</p>
<p>Having had to pause last week, I managed to scrap a bit of time together, to get it done this one. Still, my small prelude, might be shorter than usual.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <b>GhastBashers</b>. A game in which you catch ghosts, ghostbuster style, using a narrative d12 system. Fans of superheroes get a D&amp;D 5E ruleset based game with <b>Capes &amp; Crooks</b>. If you like to design your own setting, you should check out <b>Anyworld Tabletop Roleplaying System</b>. Next to the rules required, it offers introductionary scenarios for quite some genre.<br>
Fans of the old tentacled creature, can face him with <b>Cursed Captains of Cthulhu</b> swashbuckling style. Which is a somewhat fresh approach with a 4d6 based system. Those who prefer Cthulhu like it’s been done in the past, can get their serving of <b>Call of Cthulhu Classic</b> from Chaosium.<br>
The <b>HYPERBOREA 3E</b> kickstarter aims to finance the new edition of the famous fantasy rpg, with quite some fans and thus funding already. <b>Chromatic Dungeons</b> appears to be a reaction to the current „new TSR controversy“, and uses a diverse set of creators to offer an OSR game with modern sensibilities in mind – basically aiming to actively include people. Then there is <b>Highcaster</b>, aiming to enable the players to shape up legends, using the „Caster System“ as previously seen in ttrpgs like The Great American Novel and The Great American Witch. <b>Peace the RPG</b> might not look much, going by the thumbnail, yet the project offers a broad and interesting looking description. I do recommend having a look. Then there is <b>Fate of Dungeons</b>, a game that aims to offer a fates based old school rpg. Sounds strange? Yet, it is what the pitch says.<br>
If you like narrative games in the style of Fate and Numenera, and mechas, you got to take a look at <b>The Tears of a Machine</b>. If it weren’t for the system used, I would have backed it, as I quite like the theme. <b>MEGALOS: Aetherological Crystalpunk</b> sorts itself into the Science Fantasy genre and uses a narrative d20 system. For more infos, check out the project.<br>
I am quite tempted to back the solo ttrpg <b>Dwelling: A Solo Game for Ghosts</b>. I like the horror theme, the exploration of a haunted house, and the interaction with the titular ghosts. Plus, its the first solo game, that I noticed, which features Safety Tools. Very cool! Then there is the solo game <b>Adventure Squared</b>. You get a solo ttrpg, journaling game and create maps. Three things in one project.<br>
Last but not least we get to the gamebook category, in which we find <b>Chasing Tail</b>. A game in which one – as a furry – chases the tails of other furrys, and might engage in fun times. Which is why it has the „mature audience“ labe. Facinating.<br>
Next to all those projects, there are the <b>Deadly Skull Dice &amp; Sunken Skull Resin Dice</b>.<br>
You’ll find these, and many more projects, here:</p>
