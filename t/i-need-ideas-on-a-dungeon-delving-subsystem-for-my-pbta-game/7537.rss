    <title>I need ideas on a Dungeon Delving subsystem for my PbtA game</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/i-need-ideas-on-a-dungeon-delving-subsystem-for-my-pbta-game/7537</link>
    <description>I would like players to create a &quot;dungeon&quot; through moves. Rooms, challenges, opportunities and so on.

It doesn&#39;t have to be strict to an actual dungeon, it could be a codified way to represent a place or circumstance that is difficult to navigate.

I am aware of the Labyrinth move, and I really like it conceptually but I don&#39;t know where to go from there.

I&#39;m also interested in different subsystems instead. For example, I made a subsystem for creating locations based on Wanderhome&#39;s natures and it seems pretty sound.

One of my friends have considered looking at it from a downtime perspective and I do see the potential there, but I don&#39;t know where to go.

This is for my game [fantasypunk](https://thegiftofdice.itch.io/fantasypunk).

Thank you!</description>

              <p>Ironsworn Delve approaches the idea of dungeon delving as a series of interesting encounters, with wonders, dangers, threats etc, which are met based on how well a character rolls. A high roll means you find a wonder, a mixed roll means you encounter some interesting mixed with a threat, etc. You build up an exploration track to eventually locate the dungeon’s climax. Starbound, the sci-fi adaptation, expands out the idea.</p>

              <p>You may want to check some ideas in Trophy Gold. For my game I went with an ICRPG’s idea and started to make a list of scenarios a GM can use and found out it’s somewhat short, if you stick to the more abstract concepts and simplify a lot. Like “the Guardian” scenario, where you will have an NPC guarding something and PCs can either fight it, find a way around, deceive it or talk their way through. There’s the “Waves of minions”, where PCs will fight a huge group of enemies and they can either try to last until X thing happens, flee or kill/destroy whatever is controlling them. Some can even have different solutions, but the thing that never changes is the challenge itself. Some of these can be mixed with other challenges too.</p>
<p>You can easily make players roll dice into a list like that and then use more of their input to flesh each challenge.</p>

<p>What about something the players pick instead of random generators? That’s the vibe I’m going for, not a random generator, but collaborative, (procedural?) generation through conversation.</p>

<p>Treasure doesn’t have to mean gold, but something treasured: so it could be a defensible location, or a clue, or a key/tool. Ask players when it is found.</p>
<p>Ask another player for some set dressing as well.</p>
