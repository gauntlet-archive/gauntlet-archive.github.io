    <title>Dungeon World - Watery Veil Lifted - Tuesdays in July</title>

    <description>After a thousand years, the waters of the Inland Sea finally receded. Your village celebrated for a full week. The entrance to the long-buried City of the Ancients was revealed at long last, its watery veil lifted. None had dared venture beneath the waves to explore it to learn from the wisdom of your ancestors. These were the streets and thoroughfares they walked. These were the storefronts and dwellings they inhabited. The temples at which they worshiped. The taverns at which they caroused.

The Council announced that this miracle has come none too soon. They revealed that the village and all its inhabitants is about to be annexed by a powerful Mage. Having exhausted all other possibilities, the Council pinned their hopes on finding something in the City of the Ancients that might defend against this looming threat.

Now, the Council asked for volunteers to enter the city seeking answers to these questions. Despite the long-simmering curiosity, few dared to step up. Just you and three others.

Will the secrets within the City of Ancients provide the much-needed answer to the village’s impending doom? Why has the city remained submerged for so long? And what has come to dwell within its walls?
