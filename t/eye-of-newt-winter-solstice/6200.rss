Being a witch is less fun than it sounds. Sure, there&#39;s flying around on a broomstick, talking to spirits, learning dangerous secrets man was not meant to know, dancing naked under a full moon (if you&#39;re into that sort of thing)... but then, there are also people. People who always seem to need your help. People who are scared you&#39;ll turn them into frogs. People who want you to turn their enemies into frogs.

Worse: the people with magic. Like these other witches. They have no idea what they&#39;re doing. Who knows what they&#39;re up to, or what trouble they could cause? They need supervision from a sensible witch like you.

Worst of all: Sometimes, once in a blue moon, you might need their help.

We&#39;ll play a loosely associated group of witches who definitely are not a coven and probably don&#39;t agree on much, but can at least grudgingly tolerate each other when we have to.

This game is inspired by Terry Pratchett&#39;s Discworld and Tiffany Aching books, many fairy tales, and a dash of Appalachian folklore. It&#39;s based on the No Dice No Masters (aka Belonging Outside Belonging) system -- a GMless game where everyone has some control of the setting and events as well as their own characters.

This is a playtest. I&#39;ve &quot;run&quot; it several times as a one-shot, but this is the first multi-session series. So there may be some bugs left to work out.

#### Details

Venue: Streamyard, with Jitsi as a backup option. I&#39;ll email a link to the video call beforehand.

Recording: This session will be recorded. The video and/or audio may be posted publicly afterward, with all players&#39; permission. I can also cut parts out or hide players&#39; faces on the video if requested.

Attendance: Joining all sessions is recommended but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Safety: This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html), and we&#39;ll use Script Change tools and Lines and Veils.</description>
