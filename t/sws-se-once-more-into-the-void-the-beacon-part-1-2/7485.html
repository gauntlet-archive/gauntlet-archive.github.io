<p>"Once, we fought for the Republic - the Clone Wars, they call it now. We did a lot of things, not all of them pretty, but the worst of it was the job on Agurran. Nice little world in the Mid Rim. Boring, actually. Until the Cult of the Shining Void under their leader Tey’ha took over, broke the planet off from the Republic and followed a philosophy of control through fear and strength through hate. The controlled the entire population by a Beacon that emitted a low hum of anxiety and seething resentment, powered by a kyber crystal so corrupt that it had cracked and was bleeding dread.</p>
<p>We did it, back then. Barely, but we disabled the Beacon, dismantled the cult and threw Tey’ha down a deep chasm. The Republic was just about to install a democratic government and help the people of Agurran find peace when it became the Empire. Now, we all had other problems during that time - hell, we have other problems now. But it seems that the Cult of the Shining Void is back, and they may well try to install another of their infernal beacons - not on a backwater world this time, but somewhere close to the Core. They need to be stopped. Are you with me? One last time?"</p>
<p>This is a two-shot of Jamila Nedjadi’s game Once More Into the Void, slightly tweaked for Star Wars. It is strongly suggested that you sign up for both games, but it is not a requirement. You will have to sign up separately for the second game.</p>
