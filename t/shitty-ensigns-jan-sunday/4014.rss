    <description>This is for a one shot *[Shitty Ensigns](https://litzabronwyn.itch.io/shitty-ensigns)* by Litza. Rules will be taught. In the session we’ll discuss tone, choose the game frame, and get to playing.

You are an ensign serving on a starship and you aren&#39;t very good at it. You&#39;ll probably wash out within the month, but for now you&#39;re stuck dealing with alien life forms, negotiating peace treaties, and trying not to get yourself killed.

Made using a reverse PBTA system, your stats are bad to reflect how bad you are at almost everything. The lower you roll, the better. Featuring good and bad luck points, conditions, relationships, Ten Forward, the Holodeck, and more, *Shitty Ensigns* is a game about being just a really terrible ensign.

We will play using Zoom and record the session. We will use the X-Card as well as Lines &amp; Veils for safety. If you sign up and your attendance or RSVP changes, please also send me a message at edige23 at gmail. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. The session will last about-3 hours.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) safety tool will be in use.

              <p>But if I read this manual correctly, there hasn’t been a software update for three years for this escape pod. Isn’t that supposed to happen every quarter? I think we need to shut down this pod until further inquiries are made. That’s what the manual says…</p>
