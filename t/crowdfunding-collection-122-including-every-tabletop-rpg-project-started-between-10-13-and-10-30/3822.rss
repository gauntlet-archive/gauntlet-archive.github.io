    <description>I present to you the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2019/10/30/crowdfunding-collection-122/&quot;&gt;new Crowdfunding Collection #122, including every tabletop rpg project started between 10/13 and 10/30.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Following quite a break, as I enjoyed PDXcon and SPIEL, I am back at an unusual weekday. The collection covers 17 days, which has seen quite some projects started and other closed. For 7 projects I’ve been to late, you’ll find them at the end of this post. Thus, to lose no more, let’s start.

&lt;b&gt;Voidheart&lt;/b&gt; is essentially a Urban Fantasy game. You play mundane human beings who discover that there is more to the world than they knew and have to fight back against a variety of creatures. Jay Iles describe it as being about a psychic rebellion and compares it to works like Psychonauts, Persona 5 and Inception. The PbtA games overs a quickstart and I suggest you take a look. &lt;b&gt;The Ruin&lt;/b&gt; has a quickstart as well. Though it’s rather based on D&amp;D 5E and offers a post-apocalyptic setting to explore and survive. I do quite like the illustrations. Which is as well a cool aspect of &lt;b&gt;Renascentia&lt;/b&gt;. The originally Italian game takes the peninsula as a setting and enriches it with magic and enchantments apparently set in what I would call „somewhat medieval to renaissance“ times. With &lt;b&gt;Arcana Academy&lt;/b&gt; you’ll find a PbtA game that aims to over the experience of attending Hogwarts (Harry Potter) or Brakebills (Magicians), apparently taking a lighter take on the latter.
If you are yearning for Fantasy, take a look at &lt;b&gt;Era: Lost Legend&lt;/b&gt;. The game is the newest addition to the Era-system family and aims to provide a Final Fantasy style gaming experience; take a look. &lt;b&gt;Against the Darkmaster&lt;/b&gt; does offer classical fantasy sagas and by it’s own claims „heavy metal combat“. Which it does provide by a simple d100 system and the illustration, save from the opulent thumbnail, look OSR-style to me. If you prefer your fantasy D&amp;D 5E style, just take a look at &lt;b&gt;The Dark Forest&lt;/b&gt;.
If you are looking for an interesting take on survival horror, take a look at &lt;b&gt;Survival of the Able&lt;/b&gt;. You’ll be playing people with disabilities during the medieval times in western Europe and next to the normal ailments of the era there are zombies too! It does use a custom tailored version of fudge as its system. While I likely won’t back it, it’s an interesting idea and I recommend having a look. You’ll find another horror RPG in &lt;b&gt;All is Madness&lt;/b&gt;. The characters have to confront their fears or die. While the project doesn’t say a lot about it’s system, $10 isn’t that expensive and it might be worth having a look – a rather quick one as it has only hours left on its clock.
If you prefer Science Fiction, you might like to check out &lt;b&gt;Space Kings&lt;/b&gt;. The card based game invites improvisation to have your characters and crews stand up to the government. &lt;b&gt;Spaced&lt;/b&gt; does offer a more classic approach with a d100 system and its developers experience Delve. You’ll be crashing with your space ship and got to explore your crash site. If you like detailed, original settings, check out &lt;b&gt;Swords and Spaceships&lt;/b&gt;. The project doesn’t talk that much about the system, but looks nice and talks a lot about its setting.
Western are basically Science Fiction in historical, at least some SF. With &lt;b&gt;Devil’s Staircase&lt;/b&gt; you can take your dusty cowboy boots on and engage in the wild west. It is a diceless rules-light game and the InDemand phase will only last for like 2 more days. If you like your West with Elves, Orcs and other fantasy creatures, check out &lt;b&gt;Gaval Tales&lt;/b&gt;. It has them all and uses d8 and d12 at least.
If you fancy game books, you’ll find a quite traditional one with &lt;b&gt;The Necronomicon Gamebook – Carcosa&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Pitch Black&lt;/b&gt; is more unconventional, by basically being an audio based gamebook. Well, and &lt;b&gt;Spire’s End&lt;/b&gt; does approach the gamebook theme with cards. Plus it is the one that tempts me most.
Matt Colvilles sourcebook &lt;b&gt;Kingdoms, Warfare &amp; More Minis!&lt;/b&gt; got me to actually back it, as I like the topic and are curious about his take. There are, of course, many more very interesting, cool projects, just check the collection:
