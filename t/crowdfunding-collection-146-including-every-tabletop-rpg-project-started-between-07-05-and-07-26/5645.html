          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/07/26/crowdfunding-collection-146/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #146, including every tabletop rpg project started between 07/05 and 07/26</b></a>.</p>
<p>After almost three weeks passed, there are 67 projects to report on, thus, let’s get started.<br>
I will start by highlighting <b>Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall</b>. The RPG places the players in the role of chinese imigrants that happen to be running a restaurant in the American 1920s. They will have to face the challenges of keeping the business running whilst facing racism, and as if that’s enough to deal with there are the Jiangshi. Vampires plaguing the community and family by night. The game is fascinating, especialls with a mechanic that doesn’t focus on physical conflict (thus, you won’t dropkick the vampires into oblivion). I am very intruiged, highly recommend it and might join in to get a boxset of the game. I did back <b>INSPIRISLES</b> in the blink of an eye. The setting about kids and teens being confronted with creatures from Celtic folklore, Neverending Story and Labyrinth style, appears rather ’standard‘ to me. I personally got sold on the aspect that the game aims to teach the players ASL/BSL (American/British sign language). Which got me hooked. Check if out. For those who do enjoy Horror flicks in the B-Movie style of the ~50s to 60s, take a look at <b>They Came from Beyond the Grave!</b> from Matthew Dawkins. The game will have you recreate daring &amp; horrific adventures in the style of the old movies. Playing the characters, using their quips and bringing movie tropes like less than stable sets to life. System wise it uses the Storypath System from Onyx Path and I do recommend the current Actual Play series by Red Moon Roleplaying. If you want your horror with a good portion of the post-apocalypse check out <b>When Shadows Fall</b>. The system draws inspiration from PbtA, Cortex as well as the Mutant Year Zero games, and the project page offers further details. The illustration look nice and I do think it is worth taking a look. Then there is <b>The New West</b>, a PbtA Western RPG. The project page isn’t detail but it ain’t expensive.<br>
Fans of Cyberpunk and/or Hip Hop should have a look at <b>Axon Punk: Expanded</b>. The project offers an enhanced edition of the corebook. I pledged and received the original corebook, I am happy with it and thus I do recommend it. If you are looking for some multiverse aetherpuznk stuff <b>Aether and Steamworks 1.5</b> might be right up your ally. It does look at least nifty.<br>
If you do enjoy fantasy, maybe take a look at the <b>Super Simple Roleplaying Game</b>. It is a small game, which aims to live up to its name by being simple and accessible. Then there’s the <b>Magic Seekers</b> RPG, in which you play teens or young adults in a fantasy setting. It will see you be ready to go with 3 adventures.<br>
I personally couldn’t resist the optics of <b>Necronautilus</b>. A science fiction game in which you play „Death Agents“ on their missions in rather psychodelic settings. It uses „words“ a long with a role under mechanicas its base system and I am utterly capitvated. Take a look, and maybe back it too. If you are looking for SF with steam punk, <b>Brass Rings</b> got you covered. The tiny game, which should fit into your pocket, has you play adventures, bipedal space rats.<br>
Maybe you like cards or want to give cards a go? In this case, check out <b>Cartomancy</b>. You can chose the setting of your game freely and it does offer tactical depth if the players wish for it. The card design does look nice, and I feel at least a little bit intruiged by the project. Then there is <b>Duality</b>, which does offer a universal approach as well. Alas, the project doesn’t offer a lot of information and even the name is still in somewhat of a flux.<br>
There are many more cool projects. Like the magazine <b>Era Zone 2020</b> for the Era-sytsem family, <b>The Dark Eye – Gods of Aventuria</b> does offer to expand the cosmos of the originally German ttrpg for English speakers and the <b>Book of Beastly Creatures</b> does provide quite a nice menagerie. There are many cool dice, like the<b> Geocentric Light /Metallic RPG Dice</b>, the <b>Color Spray Dice</b> and even stuff like the <b>Foldable Metal Dice</b>. Then there’s <b>Dungeons of Doria</b> which offers various Print &amp; Play Tiles for rooms and artworks; both to support online roleplaying games, just take a look.<br>
Take a look at these and many, many more cool projects overe here:</p>

          <p>Thanks for putting this together! That jiangshi game looks super cool. I’ve seen more ttrpgs using board game innovations lately, which is an interesting development I think. Mostly I really like the theme though!</p>
