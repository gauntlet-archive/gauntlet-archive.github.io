    <description>H! After a long pause I went and put down procedures for my Hunter x Hunter game and I believe there are experts in this community that can help me se them clearly without sweating it to much. 

To frame the game intent some, I want to emulate Hunter x Hunter with a stress on Drama and Puzzle solving. The game wants to help players make Challenges both meaningful (drama) and challenging (puzzle solving). I walk in the tracks of @DBB David Brunell Brutman&#39;s Hogwarts RPG, with much of the mechanical aspect of the system relying on transactions of Conditions. Characters be affected, be moved, make it count !

Here it is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9Zie2_nsec7c68EFe2r7BaKqPYLA52OPNZcb-q01bM/edit?usp=share_link

1- If you have little time for it
I&#39;m trying a form longer than one page and extruding the game as it comes to me. Please let me know how it suits or fights your personal way of reading: be it the tone, order of presentation, Too Much Information, etc. except for the layout because oviously. 
I plan to present rules in this order : 1 Overall Presentation 2 Example of play, playbooks and a gameplay cheatsheet 3a Procedures for idle scenes, 3b Procedures for Challenges, from introduction to resolution 3b Pocedures for long term play, namely Quests and Advancement 4- Details on how to play in various styles 5- maybe a lexicon or FAQ if it&#39;s needed. 

2- If you have time to skim something coherent from the document, please comment on the procedures themselves, and suggest ways I can deepen them (depth=meaning/complexity) for drama and puzzle solving.</description>

              <p>I am beginning to use this thread as a development log.</p>
<p>I realized I want to make a game with a modular resolution method. From the beginning I wanted to make Challenges that would be easy to “slot in”,  rather than a bunch of sub-systems and modules. So I’ve decided to publish this game as a dorsal spine, and in parallel a few mini-games and techniques that can stand on their own.</p>
<p>This is the first technique I’ve edited enough to show: Happy Winter!<br>

The text has changed a lot. Here’s what you need to know to focus your feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>It appears I need an example of play for each chapter.</li>
<li>I am working on character playbooks, them too will structure a lot how you read the rules that follow, like how Conditions can pave your Character narrative arc.</li>
<li>The challenge procedures right now are very flat. I want Challenges to “slot in” easily, wtithout loopholes or doubts (that would work against necessary mutual trust). The “fun” will be in the Challenges themselves.</li>
