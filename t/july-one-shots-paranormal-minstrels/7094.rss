    <description>**July One-Shots: Paranormal Minstrels**
**When:**  Thursday 7/15/2021, 8:00 PM EDT (UTC-4)
**Sessions** : 1
**Players** : 3
**Content Warnings** : Ghosts, demons, death, facing one&#39;s own dark past 

***Paranormal Minstrels*** is a &quot;Powered by the Apocalypse&quot; game of ghost-hunting musicians in the 1890s who use their music to combat supernatural entities. This game was written by Mary Georgescu &amp; Ray Olsen, and appeared in the pages of  *Codex—Bone*  (issue #30). **Technology:**  We will be using the facilitator&#39;s Zoom for video chat, a shared Google Sheet as a character keeper, and a shared dice roller.

**RSVP Open Access** : 6/22/2021, 8:00 PM EDT
**Recording:**  With the consent of the players, we will record this session. The facilitator will make the recording available to players for review, and with their consent, will post the video (or audio only if preferred) for public viewing.
**Experience Required:**  None. All rules will be taught at the table.
**Safety Tools:**  The X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and Open Door are all in-play. We will review these tools at the start of the session.
