    <title>French convention Octogones</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/french-convention-octogones/7461</link>
    <description>Just came back from french convention Octogones, and my brain is going from fuzzy cozy to fizzy sizzling with ideas. I feel like a country person coming back from a trip to the big city. Lots of (weird) games enthousiasts there, authors and theorists I was excited to meet in the flesh. 

I don&#39;t want to flood the forum with that, so I&#39;ll just make a list of some topics that stay with me : 
- pride and the communities 
- gamebooks : playing alone or together ; mature stories
- slice of life sandboxes : small scope, huge work.
- various setups for empowerment : (the myth of) roll and talk ; lax on coherence ; allow the risk of meh ; speaking in turns.
- low character count, independent of player count
- listening and performing
- modern game preparation
- intercreation : leading VS following ; proposing VS reincorporating ; consensus VS dialogue
- etc.

I have no question here, this is mostly an expressive post. But there&#39;s room for your own experiences of such encounters, analysis, and confirmations that a given topic is definitely in the air / or not.</description>
