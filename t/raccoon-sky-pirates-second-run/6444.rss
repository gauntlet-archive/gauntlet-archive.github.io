Take to the skies! *Raccoon Sky Pirates* is a short, GM-less story game for 3–6 players. In it, you play a scruffy, ring-tailed agent of chaos. Find ingenious uses for trash and embrace joyful, random action.

Your home is in the junkyard. There, you and your crew built a ship out of a wrecked car, a home appliance, an old carnival ride, and other junk. You fly it to the suburbs, striving to keep it together for the sake of your shipmates. Descend on a suburban house. Steal all the Crate-and-Barrel furniture and smart-home gadgets you can find. Then fend off the Neighborhood Watch zeppelin and escape!

This game takes the stuffing out of materialist, capitalist suburban life, then invites you to dive into the hole you made by taking that stuffing out. Just inside those double-paned windows is enough loot to make you pirate royalty.

This is a one-shot **playtest** of a zine game I&#39;m Kickstarting in mid-February for Zine Quest 3. It will probably run for two to two-and-a-half hours. I&#39;ll record it if everyone is okay with that.

The content should be pretty light, with slapstick violence.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools (Lines, Veils, and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
