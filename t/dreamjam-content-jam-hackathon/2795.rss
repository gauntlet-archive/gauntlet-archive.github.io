    <description>[DREAMJAM](https://itch.io/jam/dreamjam) is wrapping up! This was a jam partially about offering some answers to the question, &quot;What exactly is this SWORDDREAM thing?&quot;

I submitted a game called &quot;[The Great Soul Train Robbery](https://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/the-great-soul-train-robbery).&quot; It&#39;s a two-page game hacking *Honey Heist* into an allegorical Weird West tale of Desperados robbing the Devil&#39;s own locomotive.

Anyone else submit games to DREAMJAM? How did you decide your game fit under the broad aegis of SWORDDREAM? I&#39;ll share my own thought process: my game is rules-light and has a whole bunch of evocative OSR-ish tables for setting details. That seemed like a good enough start to me!

Let me know if you submitted a game or any thoughts you have on the submissions or the burgeoning SWORDREAM movement/label/phantasm!</description>

<p>For me, this was an opportunity to demonstrate how PbtA can adopt the OSR philosophy of danger and adventure. It was also a great opportunity for me to develop my layout skills and work with an incredible artist! It’s currently on sale to celebrate the jams release.</p>
