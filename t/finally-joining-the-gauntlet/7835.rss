(PS, I apologize if this isnâ€™t the proper place to put a hello thread.) ðŸ˜…</description>

<p>Hey there Luke, welcome to the forum! Glad you like the podcast, weâ€™re always open to feedback.</p>
<p>As for BotW and Hutt Cartel, they are pretty popular, Iâ€™m happy to say. I may run a new series in a few months.</p>

              <p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/battledrumz">@BattleDrumz</a> and welcome aboard! I just started a solo play of Ironforged (liking it a lot) and Iâ€™m curious about coop mode (might try it with my more trad-minded home group). I would love to hear about your experience with the system after you have played. Also: reskinning systems to fit Star Wars is a time honored tradition on the Gauntlet. <em>cough</em>  <a class="mention" href="/u/richrogers">@RichRogers</a> <em>cough</em></p>
