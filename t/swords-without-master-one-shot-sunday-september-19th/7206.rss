    <title>Swords without Master One-Shot Sunday September 19th</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/swords-without-master-one-shot-sunday-september-19th/7206</link>
    <description>&quot;*Gather writing implements, scraps of paper, three or four of your cohorts, and two six-sided dice that you can easily tell apart to a table. A mahogany table adorned with thick, greasy candles and five human skulls. Failing that, a stout oaken table near a glowing hearth, replete with ale-filled steins and a succulent roast. Or, if you prefer, a tabletop chipped whole from a single obsidian stone, placed on the back of a coiled serpent of silver in a room high in a lonely tower shrouded in a prismatic fog*.&quot;

A game of strange sorceries, brutal violence and astounding wonder by Epidiah Ravachol. Become rogues in a world of swords and sorcery, living by your wits and prowess, plunging into the unknown, and seizing from it untold treasures.

Time: Sunday 19th September at 1900 GMT
Number of players: 3 - with one extra spot reserved for Mark W

Technology:
Zoom - for video communications
Discord - we will be using a custom Discord dice bot

Safety tools: Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html),  Lines &amp; Veils , X-card, Open Door policy
