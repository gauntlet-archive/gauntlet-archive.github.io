This is for a Gauntlet Quarterly series of  *Night&#39;s Black Agents*  (with modifications, see below). This will be run Jan/Feb/March 2021. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged but not required. Players in a test run will have a window of first priority. General sign ups open 12/12. Sessions are GMT Friendly on Tuesdays. 

*Night&#39;s Black Agents*  is Pelgrane Press&#39;s GUMSHOE game of burned spies against Vampires. We will be playtesting a modification of the rules. [You can see notes on that here](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-tinkering-with-spies-a-nba-retuning) those some elements have shifted based on play. Rules will be taught. Note that it is still a game with a good deal of crunch from the number of skills/abilities. In session one, we’ll choose discuss tone and safety, create characters, and set up our cell. CW: vampirism, political intrigue, betrayal, supernatural horror, violence.

**The NBA Pitch:**

*The Cold War is over. Bush’s War is winding down.*

*You were a shadowy soldier in those fights, trained to move through the secret world: deniable and deadly.*

*Then you got out, or you got shut out, or you got burned out. You didn’t come in from the cold. Instead, you found your own entrances into Europe’s clandestine networks of power and crime. You did a few ops, and you asked even fewer questions. Who gave you that job in Prague? Who paid for your silence in that Swiss account? You told yourself it didn’t matter.*

*It turned out to matter a lot. Because it turned out you were working for vampires.*

*Vampires exist. What can they do? Who do they own? Where is safe? You don’t know those answers yet. So you’d better start asking questions. You have to trace the bloodsuckers’ operations, penetrate their networks, follow their trail, and target their weak points. Because if you don’t hunt them, they will hunt you. And they will kill you.*

*Or worse.*

Content Warning: Violence, betrayal, espionage, supernatural horror, investigation, vampirism, criminal organizations and their unsavory activities.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
