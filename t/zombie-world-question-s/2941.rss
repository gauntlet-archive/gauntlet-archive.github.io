    <title>Zombie World: Question(s)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/zombie-world-question-s/2941</link>
    <description>Picked up this gorgeous game at Gen Con, ran my first one-shot last night at a local game cafe. It was a big hit, but I have some questions:

Is there an upper limit on cards that can be drawn for a move? I know that Stats max out at 3, but with certain bonuses from Identity cards, a player was prompted to draw 4. Is this correct?

One of our players was dealt the Visionary card as part of their Identity, which they narrated to include supernatural visions of future events (as opposed to long-term goals for the community, i.e. &quot;I have a vision&quot; vs. &quot;I have visions&quot;). The text on the card left just enough wiggle room (and it was a one-shot), so we decided as a group that it was okay for our session. Has anyone else run into this? Does it seem like too radical an interpretation?</description>

              <p>I think I also got into situations where a player was able to draw four cards, because of bonuses and their stats. I don’t think that’s against the rules. It seemed both thematic and quite situational in the game I ran.</p>
<p>Your players take on the Visionary is interesting, and seems like it’d be fun in play. I feel like that’s all you need.</p>

              <p>RE: limits on drawing cards, Mark Diaz Truman ran a game at Origins that I played in, and I don’t remember him mentioning a limit for Stats on a move. I did remember him mentioning a limit on how many cards you can draw for help/hinder (3 at most, no matter how many cards are showing), but that was it.</p>
<p>I think your interpretation of Visionary is totally rad, if the group is onboard with it. It absolutely changes the tenor of the game, but if you’re okay with those implications, go for it!</p>

              <p>That sounds like a radical interpretation that I would never nix, because it gives me so many story hooks as a GM! Like, I’d totally be giving the Visionary terrifying visions of betrayal and destruction on misses.</p>

              <p>We played it with players drawing four if they had a stat of 3 and a bonus to the pull. I’ve had players with the Visionary, but they were more mundane. If the table was cool with it, it sounds like it works and isn’t too radical.</p>
