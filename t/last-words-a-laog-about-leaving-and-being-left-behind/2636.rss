    <description>This is for a session of **Last Words**, a live action online game from Gauntlet Codex Melancholy written by me. 
![D_JHUR9WwAMbjNz|380x500,50%](upload://qa8BxBRGY7aG7yz284WEs7RxwXk.jpeg) 
Emotional Impact: potentially high

Genre: Personal drama with supernatural elements

Potential themes: unfortunate death, grief, helplessness, emotional vulnerability, unresolved issues, desire to help

This is a game designed for online play and takes advantage of online technology. So what you each need is a stable internet connection, each a safe and private space for yourself (usually your home), a good webcam and microphone set-up. Moreover, **two players need to establish a separate voice call through another device** (your mobile phones should work).

*The death of the Deceased came too early for the Living. There is something the Living and the Deceased had to talk about and now it’s too late. When visiting the grave, the Living talks to the Deceased about these unresolved issues – as if they could hear them. And in fact, the Deceased can hear them but cannot respond. Unresolved business in this world gives the Deceased pain and forbids them to find rest in the afterlife. An Angel, existing near the grave, overhears the Deceased’s responses. The Angel can’t hear the Living. But the Angel decides they want to help the Deceased to find rest with this world. When the Angel and the Deceased next midnight talk about what happened, the Angel decides to enter the Living’s dreams to send what the Living needs to know through symbols and visions. Maybe these dreams have already changed the Living when they visit the grave of the Deceased next time.*

This event is scheduled to run for 2 hours. It will be recorded and published if nobody vetos against that after the recording. It would be appreciated though if you only sign up when you generally agree to publication. 


[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools will be discussed. 

No preparation necessary. I will get in touch with you via email before the our event.
