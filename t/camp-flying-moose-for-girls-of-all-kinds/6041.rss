    <description>**For the first 48 hours this game is only open to those who have joined the Gauntlet since the Open Weekend a couple of weeks ago, or haven&#39;t been able to get into a game since they joined.** 

Camp Flying Moose for Girls of All Kinds is a PbtA game about teen girls at a summer camp filled with strange supernatural occurrences. Inspired by Lumberjanes, and the author&#39;s own experiences of summer camp, the game investigates mysteries, monsters, and teenage identity. 

Each session has a mystery to solve related to a strange event occurring at camp. Use your skills, friendship, and empathy to help supernatural creatures solve their problems!
