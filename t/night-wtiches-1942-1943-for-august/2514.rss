    <description>*Night Witches 1942/1942*

This is the third monthly series in a run of Night Witches that will span a number of months and eventually encompass the entire Great Patriotic War. We will wrap up the early missions at TRUD GORNYKA and move on to the meat grinder of PASHKOVSKAYA. The Nazis are figuring out how to counter your harassment, and you&#39;ll be flying over open water for the first time. This series is comprised of 5 sessions. You must volunteer for each individually. It&#39;s best if you can volunteer for all 5, but not required. If you played in any previous series, you may carry over your pilot or create a new one. CONTENT WARNING: This is a game about war, and explicitly a game about the price women pay to wage it. Violence and death, including the death of player characters, are an inescapable aspect of this game. We will use the X-Card and Script Change to assure as safe a play space as possible, as well as Open Door Policy. Sessions will be recorded for reference, but only released for public consumption if all players consent.
