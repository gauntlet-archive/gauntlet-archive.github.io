    <description>From @Tylom: 
Hi there Gauntleteers. The Gauntlet Facilitators Camps will be going up on the calendar Sat, Sept. 26th. I&#39;m pleased to say the camps will cover nearly every timezone. We will be offering 3 camps in November, but if it turns out there is a need one more may be added. Our amazing counselors @swordqueen, @Puckett, and @Alun_R  will be letting everyone know the days and times of their camps when they post them to the calendar.

The GFC&#39;s are an excellent chance for people interested in running games for the Gauntlet to learn about the tech used, the resources available, and the tips of the trade to make a game go smoothly. It&#39;s also a chance for newer members to get a feel for the Gauntlet gaming culture and get some sessions under their belts. It also allows for that sometimes nerve wracking first run for the group to occur in a safe and supportive environment. 

The first session will be a chance to learn from your counselor all the things you need to create an event, coordinate with your players, access play aids, set up video calls, and record for  posting. There will also be a Q&amp;A where your counselor fields your questions and gives advice based on their many sessions ran for the Gauntlet. The following 3 sessions will have each Camper running a one-shot for their fellow Campers and their Counselor. Throughout the whole process their Counselor will be there to provide encouragement, support, and help.

Some of the most prolific and talented GM&#39;s in Gauntlet ran their first games for the community in GFC. Not only that, the friendships created in this shared experience live on long after the tents are folded and the arts &amp; crafts are put away. So come gather around the campfire and let&#39;s tell some stories!</description>

    This post arose when I responded to s post on the Gauntlet Slack about the fact that decades of F-2-F GM-ing is no guarantee of success in the online sphere.  I went on to point out that running games online meant I was having to unlearn some F-2-F habits … 
So … Face-2-Face ‘un-learning’: 

I liken a table game to a dinner party where, even if everyone is talking at the same time, body language, a glance or a slight change in tone is enough to cut through the babble to a consensus about what ha…

              <p>I’d never run online before joining the Gauntlet about 2 years ago after that same 40+ years at tables … it takes some adjustment but I don’t think it’s much more performative … maybe a bit more ‘exagerated’ … ironically the reverse if what I remember Laurence Olivier said about stage and screen …</p>
<p>Now … I see real advantages to online … for instance, having everyone’s character sheet visible to everyone at the same time is something I’d really miss at the table now.</p>
