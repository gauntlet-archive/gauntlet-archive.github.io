    <description>It has been too long since the facilitator camp without actually facilitating a game. Time to go through the long list of games I have never played but want to try out. 

First up, &quot;Damn The Man, Save The Music&quot;, a Kickstarted story-game about saving a 90&#39;s record store, hopefully with many disasters along the way.

[date=2020-03-13 time=08:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;Australia/Perth&quot;] → [date=2020-03-13 time=11:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;Australia/Perth&quot;] [Damn The Man](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M0fGS3qnh2qDevCOdvX)

The game will be taught as we play and will hopefully be recorded on Streamyard but only released if all players agree.

**Safety tools**  : We will be using the X-card &amp; lines and veils. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet’s Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).</description>
