    <description>**Fall of Magic**
**When**: Last two Thursdays in July (7/22 &amp; 7/29), 8:00 PM EDT (UTC-4)
**Sessions**: 2
**Players**: 4 (including the facilitator)
**Content Warnings**: Possible themes of loss, regret, aging, and sacrifice

*Fall of Magic* is a high-fantasy collaborative story-game about a group of travelers in the company of the Magus on a journey across the world. On the way, we&#39;ll encounter strange hosts, fantastic places, and perilous choices as we play to discover who our characters are, how they relate, and how our journey changes them.

**Technology**: We will be using the facilitator&#39;s Zoom for video chat, and the &quot;Fall of Magic&quot; module on Roll20. 

**RSVP Open Access**: 6/24/2021, 6:00 PM EDT

**Recording**: With the consent of the players, we will record this session. The facilitator will make the recording available to players for review, and with their consent, will post the video (or audio only if preferred) for public viewing.

**Experience Required**: None. All rules will be taught at the table.

**Safety Tools**: The X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and Open Door are all in-play. We will review these tools at the start of the session.
