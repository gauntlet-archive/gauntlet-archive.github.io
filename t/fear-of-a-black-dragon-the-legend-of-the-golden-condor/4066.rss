              <p>Wasn’t really discussed during the conversation that I heard - but how was the handling of representation of the indigenous peoples in the module? I’m assuming since Tom <a class="mention" href="/u/coalhada">@Coalhada</a> was involved, it was a-ok; but the thought did cross my mind.</p>

              <p>We made custom moves for different portions of the base as it grew, not custom moves to govern the growth of the base (if that makes sense). Essentially, as we did adventures, we added things to the base and then made custom moves for some of those things.

              <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/jasoncordova">@jasoncordova</a><br>
In the episode you said that you used some moves for a campaign to see the development of the players base.<br>
Have you published/shares those moves somewhere?<br>
Thanks!</p>
