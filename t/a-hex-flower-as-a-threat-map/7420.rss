    <title>A hex flower as a threat map</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/a-hex-flower-as-a-threat-map/7420</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a wild idea, but I thought about using a hex flower as a threat map. Especially for a fantasy, OSR-informed game, for a cool feel.

A couple of things I considered:

* Dynamic hexes: when you place a threat on the map, jot an arrow to where it will move next as things happen. If the characters or another threat is there, well. Threats can clash, or the threat finds the characters.

* The characters also move around the map. Either you add more hexes and the map expands (tricky but doable), or not, the characters don&#39;t have to necessarily stay in the centre. When they decide to move onto a threat, move them on the map.

Anyways, Just thoughts. No idea if I will actually use it but it&#39;s been an entertaining idea.</description>

I failed to see the map in your previous example, I understand “map” as in  “geographical map”. Were you referring to a map of events or (“luck states”) ? How is said map . not . the hex flower ?</p>
<p>You’re right about the relations between space and drawing, so I want to ask you (and do) to Show Your Maps, please !<br>
But no rush or stress, I just mean I am interested in learning about the relations between a hexflower and a map</p>

<p>But yeah! I think I’ll try to draw my concept, which brings the next issue:</p>
<p>Hex flowers have the drawback of being extremely visual. Not sure how that would be made accessible.</p>
<p>Finally, someone came up with the concept of Ladder Tables, inspired by Hex Flowers. Maybe this could work as a dynamic clock?</p>

</aside>
<p>We’re both here to discuss an idea, so it’s clear you’re not bothering me when discussing it.</p>
<p>It seems we picture very different things for “using a hex flower as a threat map”.<br>
In your two examples, there’s a map and no flower. So I reconstructed one with the functions you present. I pictured a hex flower to determine the direction of the threat (in my mind, a beast half wandering half tracking) that would be applied as a move on an actual map. And I answered to that.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense wrt/ your second example, but my interpretative process defaulted to the “basic” use of a hex flower as hex (tile/terrain/feature) generator.</p>
<p>Obviously, that was not correct, but hey, that’s communication in progress, nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>With a threat that can “erupt” anywhere, like uprisings or mushroom blooming, the use is more like a terrain / map making hexflower. That’s where I see how the map and the flower interact.</p>
<p>I see what a hex flower for threat would do, but I see it as something abstract, like a refined dramatic clock with multiple “tracks” of various probabilities. For me, I imagine a roaming beast, getting close or wandering around. One of either the map OR the abstract dramatic flower seems enough.</p>
