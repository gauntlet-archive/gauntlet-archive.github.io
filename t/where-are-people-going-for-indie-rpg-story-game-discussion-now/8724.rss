              <p>So, if anyone‚Äôs still reading this, I‚Äôve launched it (a logo is incoming, but not ready yet). A warning: this is a project I‚Äôve had in mind for a while and it‚Äôs not meant as a replacement for The Gauntlet. It‚Äôs a different place with different goals.</p>
<p>The name of the forum is <strong>Wynwerod</strong>, an Old English word meaning a wandering troupe of musicians, literally a ‚Äúmerry band‚Äù. I‚Äôm referencing the metaphor, as popularised by Ron Edwards, of the play system as musical instruments, and of  <strong>the play group as sort of a jam session</strong> , with play/music as folk art for mutual enjoyment of the players‚Äîrather than a highly produced or rehearsed piece for an audience. I hope it gives a good impression of the values that I want to impart on this place.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs probably not going to be for everyone. What I‚Äôd like it to be is for  <em>anyone</em>  that shares its values and goals‚Äîbeyond their personal background or what roleplaying faction they self-identify with. Therefore, let me share with you the Wynwerod  <strong>agenda</strong> .</p>
<h1>Agenda</h1>
<p>The  <strong>goals</strong>  of Wynwerod are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reflect on and analyse</strong>  our own role-playing activity, to improve as players, engage authentically, and maximise our enjoyment and sense of purpose.</li>
<li>Act as an  <strong>international cultural crossroads</strong>  for role-players of any background or nationality.</li>
<li>
<strong>Archive</strong>  interesting material, or valuable conversations made on more ephemeral platforms.</li>
<li>Promote the  <strong>making of games</strong>  and play material, with the understanding that games can only get better as a by-product of great play.</li>
<li>
<strong>Discuss to find out</strong>  what others have to say.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current idea is to focus on playing on purpose, improving our skills, and collecting the wisdom of the various online spaces where great discussions are happening in one place, where they can be stored indefinitely, linked to, shared, and built upon.</p>
<p>I made a giant summary of PbtA dicing techniques, for example, at La Locanda. I‚Äôll definitely make an English-language version of that for the new forum.</p>

              <p>I‚Äôve been talking with <a class="mention" href="/u/paul_t">@Paul_T</a> of the possibility that I open an English-language Discourse space myself, inspired by the success of the italian <a href="https://forum.locandagdr.it" rel="nofollow noopener">La Locanda dei GDR</a> that I manage.</p>
<p>If I do, though, it‚Äôs not going to be a ‚Äústory games‚Äù forum or a replication of this one ‚Äì on La Locanda I‚Äôve tried to move beyond labels to encourage an eclectic style of play, with cross-pollination from different sources, and that‚Äôs probably the type of space that I‚Äôd want to set up.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested, send me a message, or an email at <a href="http://mailto:letsmakeaforum@froggyc.eu" rel="nofollow noopener">letsmakeaforum@froggyc.eu</a>, or contact Discord account <code>froggyc</code>.</p>
<p>P.S. I also highly recommend <a href="http://adeptplay.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Adept Play</a> if you‚Äôre interested in seriously improving your play. That place has helped me tremendously in the last few years.</p>

<p>Our stance has been that all games where you make fiction are RPGs. Not necessarily in a genre sense, but because we want to embrace games that push the boundaries of the medium.</p>
<p>All that in mind I think we could set up a storygame subforum for communities who need it. The mods and I would have to sort out what goes where, but that‚Äôs not too big a deal.</p>
<p>Like Christopher, I‚Äôm interested in welcoming new designs and experiments. Right now, our game design forum is only lightly populated and designers tend to post their stuff in our Tabletop Roleplaying Open forum. I like that trend, but if we could make the design forum more useful and visible, that would be great, too.</p>
<p>To be a bit blunter and more personal, I‚Äôve lost forums I was a part of, too. Servers are costy and modding is hard.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôve been a poster on RPGnet for more than 20 years, and we have a measure of stability. I‚Äôll gladly offer the benefits of that stability and staying power to anyone here who needs it.</p>

Traditionally, story game discussion seems to have worked well when there was a carved-out space of some sort that people felt safe in. What that might look like over at RPGnet is up for debate I suppose? What options would there be at RPGnet? E.g would a subforum be in line with common RPGnet decorum?</p>

<p>However, forums are wonderful repositories of conversations, links, discussions, and rules, in a way that non-persistent social media can‚Äôt be. So I would really like to have - and to encourage others to contribute to - a forum for people interested in non-mainstream gaming.</p>

<p>The Cauldron does have a <em>Discourse-based</em> server too: <a href="https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com</a>. In theory, people from here could migrate there?</p>
