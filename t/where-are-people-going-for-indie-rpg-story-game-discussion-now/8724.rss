<p>Our stance has been that all games where you make fiction are RPGs. Not necessarily in a genre sense, but because we want to embrace games that push the boundaries of the medium.</p>
<p>All that in mind I think we could set up a storygame subforum for communities who need it. The mods and I would have to sort out what goes where, but that’s not too big a deal.</p>
<p>Like Christopher, I’m interested in welcoming new designs and experiments. Right now, our game design forum is only lightly populated and designers tend to post their stuff in our Tabletop Roleplaying Open forum. I like that trend, but if we could make the design forum more useful and visible, that would be great, too.</p>
<p>To be a bit blunter and more personal, I’ve lost forums I was a part of, too. Servers are costy and modding is hard.</p>
<p>But I’ve been a poster on RPGnet for more than 20 years, and we have a measure of stability. I’ll gladly offer the benefits of that stability and staying power to anyone here who needs it.</p>

Traditionally, story game discussion seems to have worked well when there was a carved-out space of some sort that people felt safe in. What that might look like over at RPGnet is up for debate I suppose? What options would there be at RPGnet? E.g would a subforum be in line with common RPGnet decorum?</p>

<p>I’m also a designer and publisher, much of it in the indie space.</p>
<p>We’d be happy to provide a space for Gauntlet posters at RPGnet. What would you folx be interested in having? We mostly don’t divide forums by genre or topic but if that would help, we can definitely arrange something.</p>
<p>There are no technical issues with accepting new users or adding/modifying subforums. We also share the values of this community.</p>
<p>What do y’all think, and what do you need?</p>

              <p>I own RPGnet, but for some reason discussions on story games and their design never really took off there, and instead emerged in other places. You really can’t force building a community.</p>
<p>If there was some interest I could revive or repurpose a sub-forum.</p>

              <p>Consolidating around the Cauldron seems like the best route. And I know that Yochai would be glad to see some fresh energy brought to that place. I wonder if there’s a way to transfer accounts between Discourse servers, for those who’d like to make the jump.</p>

              <p>I agree about Discord not being the best alternative. I’m still hoping that we’ll come up with something that allows for longer, preserved discussions too.</p>
<p>I’m on the [<a href="https://discord.com/invite/UUsy6AK" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discord.com/invite/UUsy6AK</a>](NSR (New-School Revolution) “Cauldron”) and <a href="https://discord.gg/uTCtDxBP" rel="nofollow noopener">Dungeon World</a> Discord servers, but the fact that there is fragmentation like this is another problem - I have to try to keep up with multiple channels of conversation across multiple servers.</p>
<p>The Cauldron does have a <em>Discourse-based</em> server too: <a href="https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com</a>. In theory, people from here could migrate there?</p>
<p>Thanks for the link to the Indie RPG Discord - I’m going to jump on that too.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I miss that too. Closing of that forum and Google+ were huge blows for my story games discussions and relations.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why people are closing larger story games forums.</p>
<p><a href="https://fictioneers.net/forum" rel="nofollow noopener">https://fictioneers.net/forum</a> started up when Story Games closed, by it died out.</p>
<p>I’m on the <a href="https://discord.gg/yjMRCpZN" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Indie RPG</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/dWp8H69MRU" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Randomless Renaissance</a> on Discord, but longer discussions aren’t really fit for that platform.</p>
