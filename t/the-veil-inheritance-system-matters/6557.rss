    <title>The Veil Inheritance: System Matters</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-veil-inheritance-system-matters/6557</link>
    <description>This is for five sessions of  *The Veil: Inheritance* , where bioengineered bounty hunters take on challenges in newly colonized space. Part  *Cowboy Bebop,*  part  *Blade Runner* . Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged, but not required. Rules will be taught and we will be playing from the pre-release reference sheets and quickstart. In session one we’ll discuss tone, choose the game frame, create characters, and get to playing.

Open RSVP starts 2/20. Sessions play Wednesday evenings in March (US Eastern).

*Inheritance*  moves the assumed semi-near future implications of the setting from The Veil into a far-flung future. Humanity has stretched out into space and, to combat the unknown, megacorporations have ushered in the creation of a manufactured middle class, called Imprints. Tailored from conception, they are imprinted with genetic memories which enable them to use skills and abilities they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have access to.

You play a crew of such Imprints with specialized skill-sets taking the jobs you decide. The setting implications allow for a wide range of stories to be framed. Bounty hunters taking on contracts in order to make ends meet; rebels attempting to put a stop to the megacorporations (perhaps even the ones who created the player characters, who knows!). Or maybe you&#39;re navigators and explorers sent ahead of colony ships to find a safe path and world to live on.

You can see more about the game here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samjokopublishing/the-veil-inheritance-a-biopunk-tabletop-roleplayin/description

Each session will run 2 1/2 to 3 hours. If you sign up and your attendance or RSVP changes, please also send me a message at edige23 at gmail. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. We will use Zoom for our sessions. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.
