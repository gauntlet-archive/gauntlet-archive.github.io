          <p>With it being the first of December, the Gauntlet Calendar opens up for February. We still have room in January, so check the calendar for good spots. With the security updates and changes to the calendar, a couple of features have lost. First, players no longer receive a reminder email a week out. It’s extra important GMs send a set up email ahead of sessions. Second, GMs no longer receive an email when someone signs up for their session. So keep an eye on your events. We hope to have the latter feature put back into place in the near future.</p>
<p><em><strong>A few other reminders for those posting events.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Please post your events first to the Gauntlet Forums. We have members who don’t participate in the Slack who have RSVP access. It’s important to have events there in public for those interested in playing but who don’t back the Patreon. If you have to choose, please post on the Forum over Slack.</li>
<li>GMs it is legit to mark the first 48 or 72 hours of access as restricted to a particular group who might otherwise not get access: new Gauntleteers, people you haven’t run for yet, members of a marginalized community. If you do so, make sure you put that at the top of your event description on the calendar and when you post it on the Forums.</li>
<li>If you’re wondering what to run, check out forum threads to see what folks are talking about. Sometimes players will post looking for a particular game or even particular time. GMs if you have someone make a request, feel free to save them a seat. Just post the session with one fewer players.</li>
<li>If you’re planning on recording your event, make sure you say that in your event description. It’s also important to tell people if you’ll be contacting them via a group email. Finally, given the state of our video options it’s a decent idea to mention what you’ll be using for the session (Streamyard, jitsi, Zoom, etc).</li>
