          <p>I‚Äôm still relatively new to playing games online, and getting used to character keepers. I really appreciate the idea of being able to see everyone‚Äôs character details on one page.  Given that screen space is a premium, and some games have a lot of detail per character (I‚Äôm looking at you DW-and-variants)‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm thinking about how they might be optimized. (Not that I necessarily have the technical chops do this‚Ä¶ but maybe someone who does will be inspired?)</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sort of picturing a version of a character keeper where each player has their own ‚Äúpage‚Äù with their full character sheet, but it also has a ‚Äúheads-up‚Äù display with the important stuff from the other PCs.  And the GM gets a big picture view with everyone‚Äôs most-important-to-the-GM stuff.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶</p>
<p>What do you find most important/useful to see on a character keeper <em><strong>about your OWN character</strong></em>?</p>
<p>What do you find most important/useful to see <em><strong>about OTHER players‚Äô characters</strong></em>?</p>
<p>When you‚Äôre GMing, what do you find most important/useful to see in <em><strong>a single place about ALL the characters</strong></em>?</p>

          <p>From my limited personal experience, answers would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Most useful about MY character</strong>:  as much as possible, really (stats/traits, moves/powers, etc.). Particularly things that change on the regular (e.g. HP, conditions, inventory, spells prepped).  For a game I‚Äôm familiar with, a quick list of the moves/powers/traits would suffice‚Ä¶ ideally with an ability to expand/hover/jump to the details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Most useful about OTHERS‚Äô characters</strong>:  Name, pronouns. Picture (though with ability to shrink/collapse?).  Role-playing hooks for how to interact with them (e.g. flags, bonds, keys, drives).  Conditions or other significant, temporary states.  Less important but nice:  abbreviated stat array (so I can tell who‚Äôs good/bad at things).  Maybe the names and triggers of moves/powers (but not full effect), to help watching out for when they might apply.  Their inventory, specific powers, XP, spells prepared, etc. are at the bottom of the list, I think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>As GM, most useful about EVERYONE‚Äôs characters</strong>:  I don‚Äôt really know, as I don‚Äôt have enough experience. My gut says name/pronouns/look/collapsible picture.  Roleplaying hooks (flags/bonds/keys/drives/etc.).  Conditions, current harm/HP.  List of moves + triggers, but not full effects.  If tracking inventory, maybe level of load (e.g. 8 out of 12 or ‚ÄúLight load‚Äù) but no more.  Maybe a list of important NPCs/relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>

          <p>I actually prefer them all on the same tab,  both as a player and GM. It makes it so much easier to, at a glance,  see what relationships or moves the players want to bring into play. As a player,  it also makes it easier for me to build my character to complement the other characters for a more interesting story.</p>
<p>I always put a spot for a character image at the top because that really helps me visualize them.</p>
