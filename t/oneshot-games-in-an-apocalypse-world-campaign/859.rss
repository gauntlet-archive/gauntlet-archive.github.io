    <title>Oneshot games in an Apocalypse World campaign</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/oneshot-games-in-an-apocalypse-world-campaign/859</link>
    <description>My group&#39;s current campaign of Masks is almost done, and we&#39;ve been doing some prep for our new campaign, Apocalypse World. We&#39;ve decided to play The Quiet Year to establish our setting - we&#39;re playing in an Apocalyptic Western-themed setting with lots of snow, mountains, and community-building.

Are there any good oneshot games to play during this campaign when the full group can&#39;t make it, either with our established characters or to flesh out other parts of the world? I&#39;m thinking of playing Casket Land for one of these, for example, or Do Not Let Us Die in the Long Dark of This Cold Winter. 

Thanks!</description>

              <p>When I ran an Apocalypse World campaign, I used Our Last Best Hope to see how the world ended. My group have never ‘won’ a game, so I was banking on that working. You could ‘flash back’ to the end times with that.<br>
If you’ve only got one or two players, a game of something like Quietus could work to set up a potential horror from the Psychic Maelstrom in the future.<br>
I think it’s out of print at the moment but if you find a physical copy of The Tavern by Graham Walmsley, you could show some time in the life of a drinking hole the group frequent and the daily lives of the people who work there. It could even help examine the kinds of cuisine the community have in the apocalypse.</p>
