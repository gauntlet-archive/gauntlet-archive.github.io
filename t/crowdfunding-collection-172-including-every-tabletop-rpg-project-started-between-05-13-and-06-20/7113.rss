    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/06/20/crowdfunding-collection-172/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #172, including every tabletop rpg project started between 05/13 and 06/20&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This time the collection is back, including a little preamble. There are quite some nice projects started last week, so lets get to them:

I will start with the Urban Fantasy game &lt;b&gt;Defiant RPG&lt;/b&gt;. The game has the premise that quite some supernatural creatures entered the world to destroy it, yet proved to be defiant to their mission, and choose to integrate into the cities, ruling and having fun. The players get to play royal fallen angels, demons, gods and the like, who are in a nice position of power. The card based system intrigues me, and the book did already exist as a PDF. The combination of genre, setting and system got me backing it, check it out, if you want to see for yourself. If you like to play a fairy – one of the small folks – &lt;b&gt;Fairy Trails&lt;/b&gt; will have you covered. Following an attack by a villain, the fairies had to flee their country in a card, and thus are traveling all over the world. The game itself is Powered by the Apocalypse and looks quite very cute. I can recommend the creators, as they delivered a previous project to my satisfaction – take a look. &lt;b&gt;The Otherworlds Core Rulebook&lt;/b&gt; offers some planet hopping fantasy, with a video that oozes quite some positive JRPG vives (imho). The story driven d6 system appears functional. All in all a sound project., bietet ein Fantasy Setting, in dem man von Planet zu Planet springen kann. Ich mag die leichte JRPG Energie, welche das Video ausstrahlt, und Systemseitig wirkt es mit dem erzählerischen W6 Ansatz solide. Stepping away from lighthearted roleplaying game, you might want to have a look at &lt;b&gt;Pink Cloud: An Adventure Game for Friends of Bill&lt;/b&gt;. Based on the „12 Stepper Program“ and inspired by the „Big Book“, it offers fantasy adventures through the lense of recovery. I personally got swayed by the video, which offered a solid, alas not flashy, presentation, and chimed in. Maybe you’ll do too? Well, and to not end on a down note, &lt;b&gt;Ultimate Dungeon Showdown&lt;/b&gt; is a card game with a roleplaying game, from the creators of The Gamers. You can play the card game with the roleplaying game or the roleplaying game on its own. There is ton of cool merchandise by artisans like Level Up Dice and it looks cool. If you are a fan of the Zombie Orpheus, check it out.
Heading over to the Science Fiction games, let’s start with &lt;b&gt;Synthicide: Sharpers in the Dark&lt;/b&gt;. The project ports the existing cyberpunk setting and game over to fit into a „Forged in the Dark“ rule set. Which has been modified to add mutations and stuff to your characters playbook. I did star the project, and might pledge later on. &lt;b&gt;Lawman&lt;/b&gt; mixes its SciFi themes with a healthy dose of western and humor. I’d place the comic artstyle somewhere into the eighties, and the creators refer material like Trigun, Robocop and Idiocracy as inspiration. In regards of RPG they apparently took ideas / vibes from HoL (Human occupied Landfill). Well, and the system that’s based on a single d20 can’t be bad. Thus, have a look. If you want to engage in mechs and mayhem, take a look at &lt;b&gt;Tenzin Gate&lt;/b&gt;. I do like the design of the mechs, and maybe there’s info about the dice based system on their website?
With that we’ll get to the gamebook. &lt;b&gt;Arkham Archives&lt;/b&gt; aims to offer a complete collection of their gamebook series. The project might look splendid and enticing, yet I would voice serious concerns / warnings regarding pledging it. I backed their first project, the first part of the Arkham Archives, and received neither the eBook nor the deck of cards. Which earns the new project an heartfelt poop-emoji.
There are of course other, better projects. If you like D&amp;D 5E you might like to see the &lt;b&gt;Adventures in Oz&lt;/b&gt; transformed into a settting for said system, or want to spice up your game with &lt;b&gt;Mask of Power&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;The Creature Feature Quarterly Vol. 1&lt;/b&gt; offers monsters for MÖRK Borg and I am still pondering whether or not to back the &lt;b&gt;The Oracle Story Generator&lt;/b&gt; deck of cards.
You’ll find those, and many more projects, here:
