    <description>Luka Rejec has an interesting [post](https://www.wizardthieffighter.com/2019/quantum-characters-and-the-tabletop-role-playing-game/) on “quantum characters” as a solution to the character-customization-vs-speed-of-creation conundrum. Basically, the idea is that you can have mechanically complex characters and still get started quickly if you just sketch out a general concept at start of play, and only define the granular bits and bobs when they come up in play.

This method is explicitly called out in Fate, though it is not the “default.” It’s my preferred Fate character creation method, though. However, I’ve never seen it employed in any other ttrpg. Does anyone know of other ttrpgs that officially support “quantum” character creation, or have you used the method as a tool in systems that don’t officially endorse it?</description>

              <p>The long-running homebrew game I played in back in the ’90s had skill point mechanics (at first, before we switched to <em>Over the Edge</em>), and each PC had a few points of something we called “Didn’t I mention…?” which could be spent in play to give yourself a skill you hadn’t bought in pre-play character creation. I think the inspiration for it partly came out of discussions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarums_and_Excursions" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Alarums &amp; Excursions</em></a>, and maybe partly out of jokes we made about how Wolverine in the X-Men always seemed to be sprouting new bits of character history he hadn’t told anyone about before.</p>

<p>Quantum characters are essentially the default in freeform larp, where you’re given the bare minimum to get started and often learn who you are as you and your partners make choices during play. (And that’s the rule in improv.)</p>

              <p>I could see incorporating quantum characters into the “Advanced Freebooters” book of house rules, for sure. I might try to playtest that soon in my home game. Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>FWIW, when a PC dies in <em>Freebooters</em>, it doesn’t take <em>that</em> long to roll up a new character. Almost everything about a new PC is generated randomly (class, heritage, alignment, traits, 7 ability scores, starting gear, starting silver). The only player deliberation is in how to spend starting cash. It’s never caused a significant delay in our home games, and people are usually excited by the process because they have no idea what kind of character they’re going to end up with. But of course I am biased!</p>
<p>That being said, <em>Freebooters</em> is intentionally designed to be played at a slightly slower, more deliberate pace than most PbtA games.</p>

              <p>I’d be interested in trying a quantum approach to character creation in Freebooters on the Frontier. One of my system concerns with that game is that, for a game with relatively high lethality, it’s a bit time-intensive to create a character (at least, seemingly moreso than DW). Though I suppose <a class="mention" href="/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a> may have different insight into that. Maybe he’d be interested in incorporating “quantum characters” as an explicit option in 2e?</p>
<p>Certainly the wilderness and dungeon exploration mechanics are “quantum”-oriented. Seems in line with design intent to extend the idea to characters.</p>
