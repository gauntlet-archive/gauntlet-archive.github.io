    <description>**THIS IS FOR THE GAME FACILITATOR CAMP: OCHRE JELLY**

NUMBER OF SESSIONS: 1 Session

DURATION: 4 hours

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Total of 3 (DMless game)

DESCRIPTION:

iʼm sorry did you say street magic is a game about building a city: filling it with life and vivid detail, exploring its hidden corners, and meeting its strange and wondrous inhabitants. 

* An archipelago-based fishing town, separated by its various islands, gathers annually to celebrate the turn of the harvest.
* A collective of magical artists embarks on an ambitious project: a guerrilla public transit system powered by enchanted street art.
* In a sprawling metropolis decades from now, breakthroughs in biotechnology offer citizens superpowers far beyond mortal ability.
* This city that we call home has a magic all its own. It is wonder, and joy, and spirit ̶ and with that spirit, we breathe life into the city together.
