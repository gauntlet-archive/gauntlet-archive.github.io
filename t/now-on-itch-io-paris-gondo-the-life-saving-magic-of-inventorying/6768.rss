    <description>![Text-Only Release_V1|690x315](upload://p1nIedYVv0ej1JXjtO3JSUKhzoA.jpeg) 
*Art by Bodie Hartley*


I have released this week the first TTRPG I ever designed. :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks to everyone at The Gauntlet who give me advice and/or joined one of my playtests. :heartbeat:

*&quot;The play-based GonParis Method is a simple, smart, and effective way to banish encumbrance forever.  Adopt this dungeoneering strategy, and you’ll never be overloaded again.&quot;*

# &quot;Let&#39;s Hire a Graphic Designer&quot; 50% sale

Purchase NOW, at a reduced price, the text-only very first edition for &quot;Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic&quot; and help me HIRE A GRAPHIC DESIGNER.

This text-only release is a work-in-progress but it already contains everything you need to spark joy through the SIX STEPS of the play-based GonParis Method.

The sales from this edition will go towards hiring a professional graphic designer to make more legible and visually pleasing versions of the Rule Book, the Play-Aids and Card Decks.

# A Simple Effective Play-Based Method To Banish Encumbrance Forever

This game is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to encumbrance rules and other tropes found in beloved dungeon-crawling games.

It is a GM-less storytelling game for 3 to 6 players, designed to be played in a few hours with polyhedral dice and no preparation.

Players in this game embody Adventurers who, as a group called a Party, have reached the last level of a Dungeon and defeated the Boss who presided over it. Play starts as Adventurers discover Loot you create. The objects you decide your Adventurer carries home makes up what you pack as their Final Inventory.

If Adventurers hold on to possessions that spark joy, they might feel invigorated and satisfied for the rest of their existence, or at least until their next adventure. But letting go of less emotionally charged but useful Belongings might prove to be a deadly mistake for the Party on their Journey Home.</description>

              <p>Having played this game on Miro with Kalum, I can say the only aspect that would have made the game significantly better is the bits included in the box set!  Yes, you can certainly play without them and using Miro but the box set is what is going to convince your non-rpg fan friends to play.  In board games there is the common concept of a game that casually pushes casual gamers into their new obsessions.  This could be that game for rpgs in box set mode.</p>
<p>It’s also a solid game to play when your party runs too small (possibly even too big, although I am not sure about this) to play your regular rpg.</p>

<p>The wait is over…<br>
…physical copies and boxsets are now available WORLDWIDE.</p>
<p>Following an exciting (<a href="https://rolistespod.com/2021/12/18/dragonmeet-from-behind-the-uk-indie-league-stall-part-one" rel="nofollow noopener">but exhausting</a>) first sale at Dragonmeet, you can now purchase physical copies of the Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying <a href="https://therolistes.bigcartel.com/product/rule-book-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying" rel="nofollow noopener">rule book</a> or <a href="https://therolistes.bigcartel.com/product/full-boxset-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying" rel="nofollow noopener">boxset</a> (which includes the rule book).</p>
<p><a href="https://rolistespod.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/bigcartel.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://rolistespod.files.wordpress.com/2022/01/bigcartel.jpg?w=1024" alt width="690" height="296"></a></p>
<p>Introducing The Rolistes Big Cartel store<br>
I investigated a couple of options and finally opted to create a store for <a href="https://therolistes.bigcartel.com/products" rel="nofollow noopener">The Rolistes with Big Cartel</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, I prioritised the fastest and cheapest solution to bring physical copies to you.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll look into how to integrate the store to <a href="https://rolistespod.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">The Rolistes website</a> itself. It would be ideal to integrate together this new store, with <a href="https://rolistespod.itch.io/?ac=6hKcoR9Jch" rel="nofollow noopener">Itch.io</a>, <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/17492/The-Rolistes&amp;affiliate_id=1289000" rel="nofollow noopener">DriveThruRPG</a> and even <a href="https://www.teepublic.com/en-gb/user/rolistespod" rel="nofollow noopener">TeePublic</a>. However, this will take time and resources.</p>
<p>You have two purchase options:</p>
<h3><a href="https://therolistes.bigcartel.com/product/rule-book-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying" rel="nofollow noopener">Rule Book (alone) for $12.50 + shipping</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Manga-inspired PUR bound booklet, size B6 (125mm x 176mm). Colour dust cover with 70 pages black &amp; white interior.</li>
<li>QR code for PDF copy (featuring links to ready-to-play Mitro board and various digital files)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://therolistes.bigcartel.com/product/full-boxset-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying" rel="nofollow noopener">Full Boxset (including rule book) for $25 + shipping</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Manga-inspired PUR bound booklet, size B6 (125mm x 176mm). Colour dust cover with 70 pages black &amp; white interior.</li>
<li>Adventurer Card Decks: 51 double-sided post-its sized dry-erase cards.</li>
<li>Play-aids: Double-sided dry-erase playmat (featuring a stone that reminds me of my mother), X-card, Sparked joy card, Dungeon Generator table and GonParis Classification table.</li>
<li>Various implements: dry-erase pen and a handful of sparked-joy pebbles.</li>
<li>QR code for PDF copy (featuring links to ready-to-play Mitro board and various digital files)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of Brexit, there might be an additional VAT fee upon request from your local customs/tax authority. You’ll be informed of these, once your order is shipped, thanks to the tracking number which I’ll communicate to you via email.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:parisgondo@gmail.com?subject=Boxset%20pre-order_October%202021%20Newsletter%20">email me</a>, if you have any questions, if you’d like to order more than one or two copies or if you’d like to order the play-aids without the rule book (if you got one at Dragonmeet for instance).</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Kalum</p>

<p>Thanks to the many enthusiasts who already purchased “<a href="https://rolistespod.itch.io/paris-gondo-text-only?ac=6hKcoR9Jch" rel="nofollow noopener">Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying (Text-Only Edition)</a>”, we have reached our crowdfunding goal towards hiring a professional graphic designer!</p>
<h3>Meet Our Graphic Designer!</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/byfrancita" rel="nofollow noopener">Francita Soto</a> is a freelance graphic designer from Chile who loves the color pink.</p>
<p>She has extensive experience working on Indie Tabletop Roleplaying Games.</p>
<p>In addition to our project, she is currently working on “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adiraslattery/tension-0" rel="nofollow noopener">Tension: A Queer Cat and Mouse Romp</a>”, “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/erikthebearik/brinkwood-the-blood-of-tyrants" rel="nofollow noopener">Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants</a>” and “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1325743523/red-rook-revolt" rel="nofollow noopener">Red Rook Revolt!</a>”</p>
<p>To find out more about her work, I recommend to check her <a href="https://byfrancita.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> as well as “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/visualcrit" rel="nofollow noopener">Visual Crit Show</a>”, her podcast (in Spanish) about visuals arts and tabletop roleplaying.</p>
<h3>Do Not Wait to Get Your Copy of the GonParis Method</h3>
<p>An improved version is on the way BUT do not hesitate to purchase a copy of the current “<a href="https://rolistespod.itch.io/paris-gondo-text-only?ac=6hKcoR9Jch" rel="nofollow noopener">Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying (Text-Only Edition)</a>”!</p>
<p>As a reminder, the cost of this edition will be deducted from future purchases of the improved one designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/byfrancita" rel="nofollow noopener">Francita</a> which will feature cover art by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bodieh/" rel="nofollow noopener">Bodie Hartley</a> (and probably more).</p>
<p>Actually, any additional purchase will help us make this new version happen sooner.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Kalum</p>

<h1>“Let’s Hire a Graphic Designer” 50% sale</h1>
<p>Purchase NOW, at a reduced price, the text-only very first edition for “Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic” and help me HIRE A GRAPHIC DESIGNER.</p>
<p>This text-only release is a work-in-progress but it already contains everything you need to spark joy through the SIX STEPS of the play-based GonParis Method.</p>
<p>The sales from this edition will go towards hiring a professional graphic designer to make more legible and visually pleasing versions of the Rule Book, the Play-Aids and Card Decks.</p>
<h1>A Simple Effective Play-Based Method To Banish Encumbrance Forever</h1>
<p>This game is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to encumbrance rules and other tropes found in beloved dungeon-crawling games.</p>
<p>It is a GM-less storytelling game for 3 to 6 players, designed to be played in a few hours with polyhedral dice and no preparation.</p>
<p>Players in this game embody Adventurers who, as a group called a Party, have reached the last level of a Dungeon and defeated the Boss who presided over it. Play starts as Adventurers discover Loot you create. The objects you decide your Adventurer carries home makes up what you pack as their Final Inventory.</p>
<p>If Adventurers hold on to possessions that spark joy, they might feel invigorated and satisfied for the rest of their existence, or at least until their next adventure. But letting go of less emotionally charged but useful Belongings might prove to be a deadly mistake for the Party on their Journey Home.</p>
