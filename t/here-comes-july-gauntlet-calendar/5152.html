          <p>With it being the start of May, the Gauntlet Calendar has opened up for July. We still have room in June, so check the calendar for good spots. Remember that right now we’re giving a 72 hour window of priority RSVP Access and events may be posted as little as a week out.</p>
<p><em>Keep in mind that our next Gauntlet Community Open Gaming event will happen July 16-19th. I’m going to do my regular schedule for the month, but plan on adding a session of two for that weekend</em></p>
<p>A few other reminders for posting events.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ppost your events here on Forums. It’s important to have events openly accessible for those interested in playing but who don’t back the Patreon.</li>
<li>GMs it is legit to mark the first 48 or 72 hours of access as restricted to a particular group who might otherwise not get access: new Gauntleteers, people you haven’t run for yet, members of a marginalized community. If you do so, make sure you put that at the top of your event description on the calendar and when you post it on the Forums.</li>
<li>If you’re wondering what to run, skim through the forums to see what folks are asking about. On the flip side, if you’re a player looking for a particular game or even particular time, post about your interests. GMs if you have someone make a request, feel free to save them a seat. Just post the session with one fewer players.</li>
<li>If you’re planning on recording your event, make sure you say that in your event description. It’s also important to tell people if you’ll be contacting them via a group email. Finally, given the state of our video options it’s a decent idea to mention what you’ll be using for the session (Streamyard, jitsi, Zoom, etc).</li>
