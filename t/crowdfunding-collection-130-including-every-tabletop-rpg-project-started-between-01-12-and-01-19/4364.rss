    <description>I present to you the new &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/01/19/crowdfunding-collection-130/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #130, including every tabletop rpg project started between 01/12 and 01/19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

You’ll find that there are only 3 projects for full games been started since the last collection, yet there are still plenty cool projects.

First there is &lt;b&gt;High Colonies&lt;/b&gt;, a hard SciFi game by the creators of HarnMaster. Humanity managed to finally and ultimately ruin earth and thus had to retreat into a few space stations – now called High Colonies. Effectively reducing the population to just a meager 20 million people. The players will explore space, the relations between the High Colonies and may direct the future of humanity. While I don’t exactly got a Hard Sci-Fi vive from the cover, more like 70s or 80s covers – though the setting sounds interesting.. Take a look. Then there is &lt;b&gt;2d6 Adventures&lt;/b&gt; which offers classical fantasy with a 2d6 system as mentioned in the title. Players apparently roll up their character, who’ll be described in 12 numbers, and may choose a class (one of 30) that fit them based on their results. Last but not least there is &lt;b&gt;Strange Things Afoot&lt;/b&gt;, a Urban Horror role-playing game that incorporates creepypasta style stories. The player assume the role of teenagers, college students and try to fight supernatural creatures called tulpas. These tulpas need to be known and use the internet to spread the word, well and the net can be utilized to fight them. Sadly the project doesn’t talk about the system, but directs the interested player to DTRPG for further infos.
If you are more looking for a setting, take a look at the &lt;b&gt;Very Pretty Paleozoic Pals: Permian Nations&lt;/b&gt; for the Troika RPG. There are fore sure not a lot of paleozoic settings and this one looks colorful, creative and fun – without being to stupid. If that’s to sweet for you, check out the &lt;b&gt;Never Going Home Campaign Dossiers&lt;/b&gt;. Considering it offers scenarios, campaigns for cthulhoid horror during World War I. I got the core game, am tempted myself and do highly recommend it!
Then there are nice &lt;b&gt;Dragon Scale Dice&lt;/b&gt; made from metal. You can roll them behind the exquiste &lt;b&gt;Fire Dragon Valhalla Screen&lt;/b&gt; by Dog Might Games and put them through the rad looking &lt;b&gt;Wizard’s Tower&lt;/b&gt; by Hexwood instead of simply rolling them. If you are more looking for a calender that communicates your love for dice, check out the &lt;b&gt;Make 100 Calendar Dice&lt;/b&gt;, you might find a fitting notebook in the &lt;b&gt;Roverbook&lt;/b&gt;. There are other projects like the &lt;b&gt;Arkanos Card Set&lt;/b&gt; or the &lt;b&gt;Full-Color Custom Miniatures with Hero Forge 2.0&lt;/b&gt; – a project that’s going through the roof.
