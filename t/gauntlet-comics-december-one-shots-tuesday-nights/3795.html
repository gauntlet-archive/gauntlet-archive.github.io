<h1><em><strong>NEW BLOOD INITIATIVE!</strong></em></h1>
<p><strong>Until November 1st, please ONLY sign up for this one-shot if you’ve joined the Patreon within the last six months OR if you’ve never played in one of my Gauntlet Comics games</strong></p>

Splinter City is a story roleplaying game about the citizens of a famous metropolis, known for its iconic superheroes and titanic battles. But what happens on the days when skyscrapers aren’t being turned to cinder by the mighty fist of the Super Squadron? The characters of Splinter City are just normal Joes, trying to get by in a world that is sometimes too chaotic.</p>
<p>Protocol is a series of story roleplaying games that thrusts characters together into dramatic situations. Each game uses the same set of rules, with vastly different parameters, start points, characters, and finales. Players take on the roles of directors outside the action and characters inside the action, using the ebb and flow of four different scene-framing styles (vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles) to tell meaningful stories about characters in crisis.</p>

<p>Finally, you can play the superhero dating show game you’ve always wanted. Will Flying Alien Journalist end up with Vigilante Detective? Will Comedian Speedster decide to settle down with Super-Healing Veteran? Only you and your friends can decide. Superhero Romance gives you eight characters and a brief introduction, everything you need to turn Singularity into a dating show game about comic book supers competing to form a romantic and crime-fighting duo. These folks are looking for “partners” in both sense of the word.</p>
<p>This game is a setting hack for the transhuman dating show game  <em>Singularity</em> .</p>

<p>Superspeed might make your commute faster, but once you are at work you still have to do your day job if you want to pay the bills. We don’t tell superhero stories about people who used their powers to become independently wealthy so they could fight crime more effectively. No, we tell stories about people with powers struggling with the same day to day issues we struggle with, despite their super powers. Why? It’s the people and the world they live in that make the stories interesting and that is what you are about to play – the most interesting part of superhero stories, the stories of the bystanders.</p>
<p>In this playset, you live in a world with superheroes and villains, but you’re not one of them. You are in the orbit of one, or affected by the elements of a super-powered world that are out of control of the normal non-powered people. You may intersect the lives of the heroes and villains (and probably will) but you’re still an outsider in your own world.</p>

<p>Each one-shot game session is part of the ongoing Gauntlet Comics series. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the Gauntlet Comics canon (and on our wiki) for future miniseries.</p>
<p>The X-Card safety tool will be on the table. Lines and Veils will be in place as well.</p>
