Something&#39;s wrong with the galaxy and I don&#39;t know what it is. It used to be better, of course it did, or so they say. 

In the golden age of legend, with the Republic and the Jedi Order, when there was enough to eat and enough hope, when people could lift their eyes and see beyond the horizon, beyond the blazing light of two suns. Children were born happy and some even grew up rich. 

Now? Wretched, baking desert. Sand people, Crimelords, no account smugglers. And to make it even worse, *kriffing pod racing*. 

And you, who are you? This is what we&#39;ve got, yes. 

What are you going to make of it? 



We&#39;re adapting The Apocalypse World 2nd edition RPG, a post-apocalypse game. 



-------------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries. 

Being able to attend every session is not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. We will be using the X-Card as well as Roses and Thorns after each session. 

This game session will be recorded.
