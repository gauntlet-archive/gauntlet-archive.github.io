You have a Failed Career

You have a colossal debt

Treasure is your only hope

Fortunately, you have heard that out in the Deep Country, treasure is waiting.  This is what you know:

“Once there was an Empire of unspeakable wealth that

traded in secrets, dark wonders and death, and many of

the strange things now on earth were theirs.

They drew their power and magic

from a gate within the earth.

But, as their kingdom slowly died, they locked away their

treasure with a lake, and set there sleepless

and indestructible guards.

Everyone knows where it is, on the Lock,

upriver of Carrowmore.

No-one who goes there has ever come back.”

This will be 9 Sessions of Deep Carbon Observatory, run on Thursdays evenings at 8 PM US eastern time in November and December.  All Access sign up will begin on Monday, 10/5.  Sessions will run 3-3.5 hours. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. NOTE:  These dates include Christmas Eve and New Year&#39;s Eve.

Deep Carbon Observatory is an adventure module by Patrick Stuart and Scrap Princess designed for &quot;Old School Systems.&quot;  It consists of overland travel through a ruined landscape, interaction with strange and curious people and creatures and, ultimately, the exploration of an underground space created by a lost civilization.  The tone is melancholy and desperate.  We will be playing the game with Electric Bastionland, Chris McDowall&#39;s slick, stripped down game of deeply indebted treasure hunters out to explore the world and plunder it to pay back what they owe.  The game focuses on exploration of weird and wondrous spaces through critical problem solving.  If you get into a fair fight, you will probably lose.

We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), as well as Script Change. for safety tools.
