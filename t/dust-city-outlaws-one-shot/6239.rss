**Publisher&#39;s Description:**   *&quot; From the team that brought you*  Lords of Waterdeep *,* Dusk City Outlaws  *is set in the sprawling city of New Dunhaven. In this game, the players take on the roles of criminals on the wrong side of the law, collectively known as the Right Kind of People to those who run in outlaw circles. These criminals come together to form a crew, and take on a Job, a criminal enterprise brokered to them by a third party. Each member of the crew is a member of one of the eight cartels that rule over the city’s criminal underworld.*

*The game is built from the ground up to be a one-shot, pull-off-the-shelf adventure.*

*In*  Dusk City Outlaws *, there is no &quot;right&quot; way to handle the Job. The members of the crew formulate their own plan and put it into motion however they like; the Judge does not need to plan out plot twists and a complete narrative arc, only react to the actions of the players. New Dunhaven itself is a massive urban environment on the scale of modern-day New York City, giving the players nearly limitless freedom for the scope and details of their plan. Dusk City Outlaws uses sandbox play, accompanied by robust systems to help the Judge improvise, to give players ultimate freedom and eliminate the need for lengthy scenarios.&quot;*
