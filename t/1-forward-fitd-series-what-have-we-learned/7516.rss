              <p>Great observations, both about the potential pitfalls of “everything’s up for negotiation” and the cool possibilities of PCs being able to act at scale to shape the setting as a campaign goes on. Also interesting to note how many FitD games are still in <em>long</em> development cycles—I wonder if that is because the example and momentum of Blades makes campaign-length play a bigger focus than in most baseline PbtA games?</p>
