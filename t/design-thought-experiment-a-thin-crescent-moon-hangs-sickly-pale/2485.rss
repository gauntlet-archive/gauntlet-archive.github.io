    <description>*Consider the following thought experiment or scenario. The goal is to explore the design space around a player&#39;s role when observing or interacting with a scene in progress.*

...


&gt; A thin crescent moon hangs sickly pale over the ancient city of Umma Sabikh.

&gt;The SULTAN sleeps soundly in a room atop the Royal Palace. The hangings by the window hardly stir in the heavy, thick air of midnight.

&gt; His youngest CONCUBINE lies sleepless at the foot of his bed, looking out at the moon and wondering about her past: how did she come to be here, in this ancient and dusty place?

&gt; Outside, scaling the wall in total silence, the Sumerian ASSASSIN has finally reached the top of the minaret and is but a short leap from the Sultan&#39;s bedroom.

...

You are playing this game. One person is the Narrator, establishing the above description.

The SULTAN, CONCUBINE, and ASSASSIN could all be played by your friends, or maybe just one or two of them for now.

You, however, are simply watching and listening. You don&#39;t have a character in the scene.

However, the game allows you a variety of clever (and sometimes subtle) ways to influence the events in play and the outcome of this scene.

**Which do you choose, and what does it look like?**

**Tell us, in as much detail as you can.**

...

*The goal of this thread is to explore the design space available for players who don’t have a character present in the scene. What new modes of interaction, game mechanics, or special arrangements of the game can we come up with?*

*What do you wish you could do, in a game situation like this? What do you wish your fellow players could do while you’re playing or a scene?*

*It can be narrative, social, or mechanical.*</description>

              <ul>
<li>
<p>I step into the scene, taking on the role of a character described to be present. I begin to embody (or roleplay) that character in some respect. Perhaps I narrate their dialogue and their actions; perhaps I illustrate their inner thoughts and subtext; or, perhaps I take on their physical comportment, portraying their body language in response to the narration of the other players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I assign advantage or disadvantage to certain characters, based on their position in the scene and how I want it to resolve. Perhaps I say that the SULTAN’s position is strong on conspicuous, handing out a large die for the character. It will now be added to any rolls made on the SULTAN’s behalf, or indicates how many experience points others get for doing as he says.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I help determine the background and history of any given character, asking questions, labeling lacunae (or mysteries, points of important but unknown information), or filling out basic statements about the nature of the character (“the CONCUBINE’s basic outlook is one of <em>paranoia</em>, and her desire is for the survival of her family…”).</p>

              <p>I often think about this thought experiment since I first read it on S-G. I think it would make an interesting Archipelago playset.

<p>It would also be interesting to tell this story <em>Memento</em>-style.</p>

<p>I determine who is the CENTRAL CHARACTER or PROTAGONIST, at any point in the scene.

<p>I determine which characters will or may recur in future scenes/further in the story. (“That wasn’t the last time we’d see the Sultan…”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I determine the dice, difficulty, or stakes of mechanical procedures during the duration of the scene. (“You want to climb up the rope? That will be a DC of 20.” / “<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19130/on-a-miss-wolves" rel="nofollow noopener">On a miss, wolves</a>.”)</p>

<p>I flag certain moves, elements, or outcomes with mechanical rewards.

<li>
<p>I ask each of the players for background information, and frame flashbacks when I’m really curious about their answers.</p>

              <p>I’m really enjoying the direction this thread has taken. I wasn’t sure how people would respond, but the character-based sense of input and play you are all riffing on is really delightful.</p>
<p>I tried this prompt over at Story Games, too (which is, unfortunately, shutting down soon), and got some rather different discussion and results (which you can read for yourselves <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21109/a-thin-crescent-moon-hangs-sickly-pale/p1" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, if you like).</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favourite contributions from that thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The players can only communicate their actions indirectly to each other, through me, as though I were an interpreter; I emphasize different aspects of what they said, or rephrase certain remarks.</p>

The three archetypes - Assassin, Concubine and Sultan, represent the social and power dynamics in the situation. The ASSASSIN player is always playing Namkuzu the Killer, whose goal is always to murder the Sultan, but I can give him the Sultan archetype if I want, altering the dynamics of the scene. I can switch all three if I want. Suddenly Young Ajda is the Assassin (still a concubine, but now imbued with the powers of life and death), and Namkuzu the Killer is the Sultan (Still a murderer, but now dominant in terms of secular power), and the Sultan is the Concubine (stripped of secular power, a prisoner of some sort, and persuasive)- what does that mean? What happens?</p>

              <p>I’m not in the scene which means I’m the SERVANT, which is a non-diegetic role that impacts the fiction. I bring the players food and drink, in small but carefully calibrated quantities, and the things I bring them to eat and drink must inform their choices and words. From my culinary palette I bring the ASSASSIN something hard and crumbly and salty, but with a shot of hot, sweet tea. I bring the CONCUBINE something light and delicious that tastes, perhaps, like freedom. I bring the SULTAN something bland, but have something bitter and nasty waiting close at hand.</p>

              <p>I like the way something like FitD engages other players through devils bargains. It means everyone participates in the consequences of the story.</p>
<p>But in this scenario, i would first reach for the environment and try to shape the action in subtle ways: wind blows something over and the concubine goes to the window.</p>
<p>From a different angle, take an improv approach and have players be able to tap in for another player and take control of the action for a moment until they get tapped by someone else.</p>

              <p><em>Consider the following thought experiment or scenario. The goal is to explore the design space around a player’s role when observing or interacting with a scene in progress.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thin crescent moon hangs sickly pale over the ancient city of Umma Sabikh.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The SULTAN sleeps soundly in a room atop the Royal Palace. The hangings by the window hardly stir in the heavy, thick air of midnight.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His youngest CONCUBINE lies sleepless at the foot of his bed, looking out at the moon and wondering about her past: how did she come to be here, in this ancient and dusty place?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Outside, scaling the wall in total silence, the Sumerian ASSASSIN has finally reached the top of the minaret and is but a short leap from the Sultan’s bedroom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p>You are playing this game. One person is the Narrator, establishing the above description.</p>
<p>The SULTAN, CONCUBINE, and ASSASSIN could all be played by your friends, or maybe just one or two of them for now.</p>
<p>You, however, are simply watching and listening. You don’t have a character in the scene.</p>
<p>However, the game allows you a variety of clever (and sometimes subtle) ways to influence the events in play and the outcome of this scene.</p>
<p><strong>Which do you choose, and what does it look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell us, in as much detail as you can.</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>The goal of this thread is to explore the design space available for players who don’t have a character present in the scene. What new modes of interaction, game mechanics, or special arrangements of the game can we come up with?</em></p>
<p><em>What do you wish you could do, in a game situation like this? What do you wish your fellow players could do while you’re playing or a scene?</em></p>
<p><em>It can be narrative, social, or mechanical.</em></p>
