          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/09/28/crowdfunding-collection-151/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #151, including every tabletop rpg project started between 09/20 and 09/27</b></a>.</p>
<p>The collection is back to its normal, weekly release and thus offers a short, yet mostly very delightful, list of projects. Enjoy! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I will start with the <b>Good Strong Hands RPG</b>, which offers a dark game with whimsical elements. The name is inspired by the heart wrenching scene of the Neverending Story and the setting premise does somewhat follow the book/movie as the players try to save the world of Reverie from the destructive „Void“. Thus the stories focus on friendship, teamwork, dangerous forces and handling a world in crisis. The world of Reverie is created by the players in a group effort, as it is a world of imagination. The system offers gamebooks and a d6 pool system. I feel very tempted to back it, and recommend you take a look. I am as well enticed to back the 2nd edition of <b>Kingdom</b>. The game, by renowned game designer Ben Robbins, has you forming a community ~ well the titular kingdom ~ and explore what happens to it. The concept is cool, and you can be quite sure Ben delivers. Fans of genre pieces like Indiana Jones, the Mummy, Uncharted &amp; co. should have at <b>Broken Compass</b>. The game has already funded, and created an Italian edition, and now its up to get the books out in English. You can check out the quickstart rules, and I do love that the core book is presented in a notebook/journal style book. Which is, why I do consider backing it, while not being that much interested in the genre. Which is cool too. It helps, that the game looks great. If you are looking for a new system, along with settings, you should check out <b>Epic! Game System: Realms of Mana and Stars of Mana</b>. The system is promised to be brand new, and will be available under an OGL like license. Next to that you’ll get a fantasy setting in Realms of Mana and a science fiction sandbox setting in Stars of Mana. A nice project, that does appear to have a lot of work being done at…<br>
The times of corona, might have you looking for another journaling rpg, in which case <b>Down the Old Rail Line</b> has you covered. It’s a small, charming, PDF only game, in which you take a bicycle trip through a fantasy world and note down the foreign landscape and events. Next to being nice, it is at a rather low price bar.<br>
Fans of game books, should check out the <b>Arkham Archives</b>, which explore the works and settings of Lovecraft. The project offers the first part of a five part series. Next to a book, you’ll get a stylish deck of cards, which got me hooked, especially at ‚just‘ 15€. Take a look.<br>
There are other cool projects, like the <b>The Wagadu Chronicles</b>. Next to a nice, isometric afrofantasy MMO, it offers a D&amp;D 5E setting book to go along with it. I did join the nice project from a game dev studio in Berlin (Germany) and recommend you have a look. If you wonder how to put more Dragons into your D&amp;D game, checkout <b>The Cosmic Dragon Breviary: A Draconic Compendium</b> – it gets you a lot of draconic stuff. Though if you up for an adventure, pardon an incursion, for the Trophy RPG, take a look at <b>Alchemy</b>. Then there are <b>Ice Dice</b>, offering you a mold to create ice dice, to keep your drinks cool. The <b>Amazing Fireball Dice</b> on the other hand ain’t to hot to game, and look great. There is a deck of card like the <b>Itemancy Cards</b> for D&amp;D or a soundscapelike <b>Winter RPG Adventure</b>.<br>
You find these, and many, many more projects, in this list:</p>

<p>4 Roleplaying Games<br>
1 Solo Roleplaying Game<br>
1 Gamebook<br>

6 Sourcebooks<br>
