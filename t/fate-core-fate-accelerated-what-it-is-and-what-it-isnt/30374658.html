          <p>The big difference between Fate Core and Fate Accelerated is that Core uses a list of 18 default skills (what you do) and Accelerated uses a list of six approaches (how you do it). This also affects how stunts are written since Accelerated doesn‚Äôt use skills, but stunts essentially work the same. There are some minor differences involving stress tracks and consequences. You can easily pull things from Core into Accelerated though. And vice versa - lots of Fate Core players import the Mooks and Groups of Mooks rules from Fate Accelerated into their games.</p>
<p>I really like the Fate build in Fate Freeport which is essentially D&amp;D converted to Fate Core. Instead of the default list of 18 skills though, it uses six skills each named after one of the traditional six D&amp;D ability scores. It‚Äôs a nice middle ground between Core and Accelerated.</p>
<p>As for actual play, there really isn‚Äôt much difference at all between Core and Accelerated. Accelerated is a nice choice when the PCs are going to have very similar roles like a police procedural for example; instead of everyone having the same or similar skill lists, they can each approach a task in different ways: one cop will Carefully interrogate a suspect, another will do so Forcefully, a third might do so Cleverly.</p>

          <p>The default assumptions of Fate Core is that characters have various skills at certain levels. You‚Äôll probably have different skills for different games, but they‚Äôre going to be pretty much the usual style of stuff ‚Äì ‚ÄúHacking‚Äù or ‚ÄúPiloting‚Äù or ‚ÄúRhetoric‚Äù or ‚ÄúShaolin Kung-fu‚Äù.  Whatever. Skills. You know 'em. You‚Äôve played a bunch of games that use them.</p>
<p>Fate Accelerated dispenses with skills entirely.  Instead, characters have a short list of Approaches that they use, that answer the question not of ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù (‚ÄúI‚Äôm hacking the system!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm punching the bear!‚Äù)  but instead ‚ÄúHow are you doing it?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow are you hacking the system?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, honestly, there isn‚Äôt time for a lot of futzing around;  I‚Äôm just going to brute force this. I don‚Äôt care if I leave a trail or what.‚Äù (Forcefully) or ‚ÄúHow are you punching the bear?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get into a bear hug or anything nasty, so I‚Äôm darting in and out, float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!‚Äù (Quickly) etc.</p>
<p>It turns a lot of traditional assumptions sideways and makes for a very interesting game.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not familiar with Fate but this is super interesting. Isn‚Äôt it the same idea, or similar, to how states work in The Veil (‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this angrily!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this confidently!‚Äù)? And, now I come to think of it, it also lines up with what I think is a reasonable interpretation of stats in Apocalypse World.</p>

          <p>It‚Äôs not dissimilar to how things work in The Veil, though FAE Approaches are pretty static, whereas my impression of The Veil (Disclaimer: I haven‚Äôt read it) is that since your stats are kinda your emotional state (Kinda like Masks?) they change with some frequency?</p>
<p>FAE, being a little more action-move-like, is more interested in ‚ÄúThis guy is the Careful guy. He likes to do things methodically, and gets flustered and does badly if forced to do something Quickly.

<p>my impression of The Veil (Disclaimer: I haven‚Äôt read it) is that since your stats are kinda your emotional state (Kinda like Masks?) they change with some frequency?</p>

<p>My understanding is that your states are constant. They describe how well you deal with each emotional state. You choose which one to use when you roll, but that doesn‚Äôt change them. (Exception: it‚Äôs possible to use one emotional state so much that it spikes, and then you get a penalty.)</p>

          <p>Ah, okay, so a little less like Masks then.  Pretty close, but not quite the same, obviously.</p>
<p>The difference ‚Äì a rather crucial one to me ‚Äì between this method and Apocalypse World is that in AW, each rating is tied to specific actions.  Barring playbook specific moves, you don‚Äôt get to Attack Someone with +Cool;  This is not the case in Fate Accelerated ‚Äì Forceful hacking can totally be a thing.  As a result, it feels more like ‚Äúpeople try to do things the ways they are good at‚Äù instead of AW‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople try to do the things they are good at.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Does Fate Accelerated ever run into the problem where a player just spams the same approach for everything because it is their best one? Or is there a bit of table discussion (or even rules discussion) about some approaches almost never being valid in certain circumstances (forcefully sneaking perhaps??)</p>

          <p>In my experience, people definitely ANGLE towards their best approaches, and that‚Äôs sortof the point.  I don‚Äôt remember the rules saying anything about certain approaches being verboten for particular circumstances, but certainly a bunch of them do seem obvious ‚Äì forceful pairs poorly with subterfuge actions and careful pairs poorly with time sensitive situations. Clever can be more tricky to rein in.  But really, at the end of the day, if people can frame an action in a way that‚Äôs within striking distance of an approach, I‚Äôd let them do it.</p>
<p>This is a fiction first system, so you don‚Äôt get to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this cleverly‚Äù you have to describe what you‚Äôre doing and then pivot back to picking the approach that makes sense.</p>

          <p>Like it‚Äôs been mentioned before, you go with the Approach that best makes narrative sense according to the fiction the players are presenting. However sometimes more than one Approach can be argued to be triggered by the fiction. For example say I‚Äôm trying to blind a foe by throwing dirt in their eyes. We can argue that the best approach is Sneaky but one can make a case for Quick, Clever, Forceful, Careful, or even Flashy.</p>
<p>This is why I tell players that some Approaches may have a lower difficulty than others because they make more narrative sense in the story. Maybe your foe is a supernaturally fast creature so Quick might be an Overcome of +6 while Sneaky would be a +4 difficulty, or your foe can read minds making the Sneaky approach impossible because they know what trick you‚Äôre trying to pull.</p>
<p>I always try to tell my players the difficulty of an Overcome or Create Advantage action ahead of time so they can make an informed decision. I tell them that sometimes your character knows that what they‚Äôre trying to do is almost impossible so step back maybe Create some Advantages and try again when things are stacked in their favor.</p>

          <p>I read the fate core rulebook and have started a somewhat rules light fate game.</p>
<p>The aspects and fate points seems interesting. Somewhat reminiscent of burning wheel, in a good way. Curious to see how it plays out, but I like systems that use mechanics to encourage the group to play into the drama they‚Äôve decided matters to their character.</p>
<p>Something I hated from the book though was how they recommended setting the values for skill challenges. They actively recommended against trying to be objective, and more aim for how hard you want it to be‚Ä¶I hate this! Pragmatically I get it, but then like‚Ä¶why bother with the skill pyramid at all if the GM is encouraged to be like ‚Äúhrm, this should be a player skill-2 type challenge‚Ä¶‚Äù I think being aware of how skillful they are in crafting encounters etc is obviously good, but always anchoring off of their skills in that way really rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
<p>These days I find myself with little patience for skill systems I guess. I think this is an area where PbtA shines in comparison.</p>

          <p>Huh, that‚Äôs super weird.  I‚Äôve never actually read Fate Core, but accelerated basically just says this for difficulties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low difficulties are best when you want to give the PCs a chance to show off and be awesome. Difficulties near their approach ratings are best when you want to provide tension but not overwhelm them. High difficulties are best when you want to emphasize how dire or unusual the circumstances are and make them pull out all the stops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along with a sidebar about how different approaches might have different difficulties and some rules of thumb like ‚ÄúIf you can think of at least one reason why the task is tough, pick Fair (+2)‚Äù.</p>
<p>More proof that Fate Accelerated is the best Fate game, I guess. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
