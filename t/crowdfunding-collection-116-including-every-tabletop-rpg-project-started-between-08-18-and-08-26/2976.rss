    <description>I present to you the new &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2019/08/26/crowdfunding-collection-116/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #116, including every tabletop rpg project started between 08/18 and 08/26.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

You’ll find the new game &lt;b&gt;Never Knows Best&lt;/b&gt; created by Fraser Simons offers a quite unique setting as you play teens who can transform into robots to deal with their problems and growing up. Taking cues from FLCL – or „FuriKuri“ as I remember the series – the setting promises to be a tad bit wild. The system is a mix of Powered by the Apocalypse and Blades in the Dark. I am intruiged and starred the project. The only other fully fledged game in the list is &lt;b&gt;The Quantum Drift&lt;/b&gt;. From what I understood it takes the tradition of „forum fiction rpgs“, where one continues a story from the perspective of their character in essentially a writers circle, and takes it to Facebook. I think it sounds interesting, yet am a bit confused about the need to crowdfund it.
Next to the games there are two Patreons. On the one hand you can support &lt;b&gt;Tracy Barnett&lt;/b&gt; as they are creating tabletop rpgs (I guess story games style), podcasts, offer streaming and more. On the other hand you might look at the Patreon of &lt;b&gt;Anna Kreider&lt;/b&gt; and help her writing about feminism in game and helping marginalizted groups. I think both patreons are pretty cool.
Among the sourcebooks I am most tempted by &lt;b&gt;On Downtimes and Demesense&lt;/b&gt;. The topics are quite interesting and I am having an eye on it. If you’d like to check it out, it has already less than a week to go. For fans of richly illustrated fantasy rpgs &lt;b&gt;Trudvang Chronicles: Mupselheim&lt;/b&gt; is a must see. Well, and if you like to have another combat system for a popular fantasy setting, check out the &lt;b&gt;Percentile dice combat module&lt;/b&gt;. You might as well marvel at dice like &lt;b&gt;The Path of Chaos Metal RPG Dice Set&lt;/b&gt; or the &lt;b&gt;Solid Brass Raised Pip Dice&lt;/b&gt;.
Next to quite some more projects worth having a look at:
