    <title>Codex - Childhood Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-childhood-miscellany/2959</link>
    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Childhood! This one is called “Three Dozen Horrors in the Land of Candy.” Imagine if the people who made the Kingdom Death board game got their hands on the Candyland license—that’s what this one is all about. A couple of notes: 1) avoid sexist imagery and 2) avoid using licensed Candyland characters (but please make up new characters!)

Submissions should be no more than 2-3 short  sentences. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. 

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread). 

Here are some examples:

“The Toffee Duke’s favorite method of executing political prisoners is to dip them in molten sugar, sprinkle them with nuts, and then crack them into pieces which are then sent to the four corners of the Toffee Duchy—a warning to those who would raise a frosted hand against him.” 

 “If you brush away the crystal sugar from one of the rotund, gelatinous mounds that line the Gumdrop Pass, you’ll see there is a tiny fairy trapped inside—as a mosquito in amber—their face twisted in agony.”

“La Dama Catrina serves delicious sugar skull sweets to visitors of her elegant hacienda. Each skull is decorated with colored sugar and bright, candy jewels, and if you hold one up to your ear, it will whisper things to you: tales of La Catrina’s wickedness, gossip about her neighbors, or secrets within her home.”

              <p>Do not stay here. You might think that this vista of trees and rolling hills would make a pleasant place to picnic and eat your salty sandwiches. At first you will notice a twitching of the long grass as if something small were moving through it at ground level. If you do not heed this warning your blankets will soon be festooned in sticky trails as thousands of gelatin annelids converge to feast all that they find, be that bread or brain.</p>
