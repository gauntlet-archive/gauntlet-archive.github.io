    <description>Hey y’all, I’ve release a demo version of HILT // BLADE as I near the end of writing it. It’s basically a playtest version or free ashcan, if you’re of that lexical persuasion.

You can find it here: https://agonysonggames.itch.io/hilt-blade

I’d love to know, what you think if you get a chance to play it!</description>

              <p>The full game is released! Right now there is only a print-it-yourself zine, but I will be adding screen versions and an epub version soon! You’ll get access to those as soon as they’re available if you purchase the PIY version.</p>
<p>There will also be a print-on-demand option later from DriveThru and Lulu!</p>

              <p>This is only a fraction of the full game and a lot of it has been designed specifically for this play pack — so there will be changes with the full release. It’s also not at a “finished” state, so there may be changes even to the current, full version.</p>
<p>To give some context on a few of your comments:</p>
<p>“Delimiting” is pretty non-negotiable. I’d read over the explanation of it in the Reference Sheets again. “Turbo” or something like it (a cool-sounding or positive name) would be a disservice to the central conflicts the game is trying to evoke.</p>
<p>Freud really doesn’t have anything to do with it. That’s mostly <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-and-philosophy/202003/neon-genesis-evangelion-and-the-hedgehogs-dilemma">a nod to Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>. I want the stats to reflect the interiority of the characters, not what they can or can’t do (or what they are good or bad at), which is why I use Freud’s model — in the end, it’s all pretty arbitrary.</p>
<p>There will be more rollable tables for Blade looks, but certainly not unique to every playbook. The looks have no mechanical effect, so, at best, they’re just fictional positioning. Really I would encourage any player to make their giant robot look however they like, as long as it’s humanoid.</p>

              <p>I outright don’t like some words *edit: but that’s me having a problem, not the game ! *<br>
Delimiting. I’d rather something more turbo.<br>
Freudspeak. What’s the bearded guy got to do with mechas ? Edge, Authority, By-the-book or whatnot.<br>
I love the “act selfishly” trope ! But I’d call it Pull a stunt, Go it alone, or anything snappy because teen pilots are the coolest kids and it should show in table talk.</p>
<p>Typo "after every <em>successful?</em> operation. ", “the utilize”, “doing poorly in managing”, “to to authority” Over.</p>
<p>I’d like Blade customization to be small lists with difference between play books, like for the character looks.</p>
<p>I’d also like a reference sheet with suggested chassis and parts and drawn schematics. And a list of names I could bolt on anything (gear or factions)</p>
<p>Seriously, I would understand if you told me you’re not considering any of this unless I paid for the additional work !</p>
<p><em>My apologies for the blunt tone of the post : you managed to pack a lot of deep mobile suit goodness in a few pages.</em></p>
