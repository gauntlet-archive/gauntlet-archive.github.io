    <description>Hey all!

I&#39;ve been working on a platform for easily playtesting storytelling games, with content managed in from Google Sheets. I launched it last week and it&#39;s called Story Synth: [https://storysynth.org](https://storysynth.org/)

It already works for several game formats, including For the Queen and The Quiet Year. You can add your custom content by pasting a link to a spreadsheet; no coding needed. There&#39;s more info, including how-to guides, on the About page.

My goal for Story Synth is to lower the bar to designing and testing games. There are three main ways to use it:

1) Running a playtest by pasting in a spreadsheet link
2) Publishing your game through it (requires some code)
3) Hacking it to add your own mechanics (lots of code)

Also – here&#39;s a [video tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLQk3zyVyVI)

I&#39;m happy to answer any questions and am especially keen to hear feedback and feature requests as I continue building out the platform!</description>

              <p>Hey, that same information could be a nice addition to the template page !<br>
I am interested by the slot machine then. Now I see what I can do with it… I’ll tinker with it some before coming back with questions. Thank you !</p>

              <p>It definitely doesn’t cover everything! It’s currently best suited to games that are, at their core, a series of prompts (random, linear, or a mix of both).</p>
<p>Some examples for the different modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shuffled: For the Queen, The Quiet Year</li>
<li>Timed: Find / Fix / Finish (a Jason Morningstar game that takes place in real time</li>
<li>Secret: likely a better fit for larp where different folks get secret info / prompts</li>
<li>Monster: custom made for my game <a href="http://monster.diegeticgames.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Dawn of the Monster Invasion</a> but works if you want to design a mostly linear game with a few player options at different junctures</li>
<li>SlotMachine: perfect for drawing from multiple decks or rolling on tables (e.g. a random encounter with a setting, a threat, and an opportunity)</li>
</ul>

              <p>I like everything about the project. Yet I don’t see how you can playtest all sorts of story games on the platform. It’s intriguing. I need to push my imagination because I don’t play much online.</p>
