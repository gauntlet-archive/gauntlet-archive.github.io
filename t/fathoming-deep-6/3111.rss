    <description>Just had an idea of a game crossover between Night Witches and the movie, The Abyss where you play a group of highly skilled deep-sea explorers who discover more than they imagined.

Who&#39;d play this?</description>

              <p>A couple things about why I feel Night Witches could be a good inspiration for deep-6 is that it does have the uncertainty whenever you go out and down into the deep. Ships and drones have names and personalities. The relationships are key. There are cross-purposes, such as orders from outside the mission. There’s the idea of authority and how well you can trust your team and yourself when it really matters. Would this game have aliens? I don’t know. But there’s a lot of humanity on the line and fair amount of things that can change without warning and are out of control, like the weather or one person’s decision to sabotage something. There is a threshold on how far you can go based on your gear challenged by our desire to surpass that. Temperature, scarcity of resources, an abundance of water, and maybe nukes.  <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  You could do a submarine crew if you wanted it more like a war time game with the threat of torpedoes and defecting captains. But I was thinking of a crew that does rescues, salvage, etc.</p>
