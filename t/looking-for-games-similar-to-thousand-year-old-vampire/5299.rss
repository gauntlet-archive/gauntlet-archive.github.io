    <title>Looking for Games Similar to Thousand Year Old Vampire</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-for-games-similar-to-thousand-year-old-vampire/5299</link>
    <description>I started playing **Thousand Year Old Vampire** last night and it&#39;s tickling just the parts of my brain that needs it right now. I expect I&#39;ll enjoy playing through it at least a few times, but I&#39;d like to look at other solo games in the same vein for variety.

Specifically, what I like is...
* Minimal mechanics, but a clear structure,
* Strong/provocative/leading prompts,
* Writing as a core player activity.

Taking a look at itch.io, **Alone Among the Stars** looks promising and it&#39;s free so I suppose I&#39;ll check that out when I get home.

Has anyone tried **Sigils In the Dark** or **Princess with a Cursed Sword**? They seem to be in the general direction of what I&#39;m looking for. (I&#39;m a little hesitant towards the latter since I tend to prefer verbal to visual prompts, but if it&#39;s good I&#39;ll give it a whirl. Deity knows my tarot cards could use a workout.)

I&#39;ll stress again that I&#39;m specifically looking for solo games. Trying to pull in other players requires more energy than I have right now.</description>

<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/anders">@Anders</a>, Sigils is somewhere between a journaling game and a gm supplement. I say that because there is equal emphasis on journaling and making the journal look cool.</p>
<p>You play as a mage attempting to discern the meaning of symbols you see in the darkness and using them to build spells in the hopes you may use the to fulfill your need. The prompts come in is as the costs to complete spells. Your mage will continually double down on the increasingly horrific costs while hoping it will all be worth it in the end.</p>
<p>The resulting journal becomes an excellent artifact if you ever want to use it in a game as a villain’s journal.</p>

              <p>It’s relatively short, and I don’t know where you stand on Canadian folk songs/sea shanties, but my privateer journaling game <a href="https://lari-assmuth.itch.io/god-damn-them-all" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>God Damn Them All</em></a> might be of interest.</p>
<p>Also, it is free.</p>

              <p>I started playing <strong>Thousand Year Old Vampire</strong> last night and it’s tickling just the parts of my brain that needs it right now. I expect I’ll enjoy playing through it at least a few times, but I’d like to look at other solo games in the same vein for variety.</p>
<p>Specifically, what I like is…</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal mechanics, but a clear structure,</li>
<li>Strong/provocative/leading prompts,</li>
<li>Writing as a core player activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a look at <a href="http://itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">itch.io</a>, <strong>Alone Among the Stars</strong> looks promising and it’s free so I suppose I’ll check that out when I get home.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried <strong>Sigils In the Dark</strong> or <strong>Princess with a Cursed Sword</strong>? They seem to be in the general direction of what I’m looking for. (I’m a little hesitant towards the latter since I tend to prefer verbal to visual prompts, but if it’s good I’ll give it a whirl. Deity knows my tarot cards could use a workout.)</p>
<p>I’ll stress again that I’m specifically looking for solo games. Trying to pull in other players requires more energy than I have right now.</p>
