    <title>Rowan, Rook &amp; Decard&#39;s HEART soon to enter open playtest</title>

    <description>I heart Grant because he is both lovely and also great at designing play experiences (see **Goblin Quest**, **Spire RPG**, and **Skyfarer**).  The core team is nicely diverse too. 

Their latest, **HEART** is a standalone system aligned with **Spire** both mechanically and narratively where you explore a shifting mythic underworld that&#39;s actively trying to kill you and keep you. 

If you want to read more and see some pretty art and maybe sign up for their playtest pack, go here — https://rowanrookanddecard.com/sign-up-for-the-heart-rpg-playtest-now/

I hear they&#39;ll also be at GenCon if you want to play with Grant himself leading (he&#39;s tall and charming soo)</description>
