DESCRIPTION: 
iʼm sorry did you say street magic is a game about building a city: filling it with life and vivid detail, exploring its hidden corners, and meeting its strange and wondrous inhabitants. 		 	 	 				
* An archipelago-based fishing town, separated by its various islands, gathers annually to celebrate the turn of the harvest.
* A collective of magical artists embarks on an ambitious project: a guerrilla public transit system powered by enchanted street art.
* In a sprawling metropolis decades from now, breakthroughs in biotechnology offer citizens superpowers far beyond mortal ability.
* This city that we call home has a magic all its own. It is wonder, and joy, and spirit ̶ and with that spirit, we breathe life into the city together.
