    <title>Longer Campaigns Without XP</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/longer-campaigns-without-xp/2106</link>
    <description>One of the lifelong wishes I have is to run a long-term campaign. My current system of choice is Troika! The main issue is that there is not much in terms of coded-in advancement. That leads me to the question of how to engage a group long term without the XP gain carrot.

(I do realize that the wish I have might not be plausible, but I am curious on what can incentivize a group in the long run.)</description>

              <p>Normally I play in campaigns without XP, but there was one where XP was used and I appreciated it. I think this might be an interesting example in terms of a non-obvious benefit from using XP.</p>
<p>It was a game of Exalted at a pretty high power level. Three factors were relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game was quite chaotic, with all characters running in different directions, chance superpower effects teleporting us all over the place and so on.</li>
<li>Exalted has a lot of superpowers for different character and creature types that involve mind control, changing personality attributes, etc. Essentially forcing themselves on your character play.</li>
<li>My character was a builder, basically, geared towards creating something lasting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I approached the game from my character’s perspective, but that was frustrating because it was very hard to get anything done. Maybe I should have played a chaos trickster and it would have been easier, but I didn’t. I played an empire builder who’s efforts were stymied.</p>
<p>In time, I started to find this increasingly frustrating, especially as it felt like i had to fight just to keep my character coherent (from all that mind magic stuff etc). The one area where i had absolute control was XP. I could set goals, I got XP, goals were realized, I could use new powers in the game. That was fun.</p>
<p>Then one time because of one of those superpower effects from Death Lord or a Neverborn or some such, I momentarily lost control of how I spend XP.</p>
<p>I hated it so viscerally! I was so angry! At first I felt a little foolish because I thought it was silly to react so much to something like XP, but then I started thinking about the larger framework, about what I can control and achieve as a player in this game, and what I can’t.</p>
<p>So in summary, spending XP is control and self-determination, which can matter if a game is super chaotic.</p>

<p>For me and for the people I’ve played with, the majority of out long-form play experience has been with character-driven, rules light, freeform-ish campaigns. For this type of play, some of the main incentives include</p>
<ul>
<li>seeing how the events unfold,</li>
<li>seeing how our characters’ personal issues develop and relationships deepen,</li>
<li>seeing the long-term effects of out characters’ actions in the game world,</li>
<li>learning more about how the game world works,</li>
<li>enjoying the escalation of scale as once distant events and characters become into focus,</li>
<li>having our characters’ reputations grow due to our actions, and</li>
<li>getting more attached with what’s familiar.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever played a long-term campaign with actual experience points. What motivates me is the content of the game. If it’s good, I’ll keep playing. If it’s not, there’s no amount of mechanical reinforcement that could make me stay.</p>

              <p>The game I am working on (and running) now has no XP or other codified advancement. It is a bit weird fantasy adventure, so not that dissimilar to the implied setting of Troika.</p>
<p>While the game is mainly about discovery, so the main “carrot” in my game is world-building and system-building (players have a say on what moves to add to the mechanics), we also lean into the tried and true fantasy tropes.</p>
<p>With that I found that a good carrot to quench that tropey fantasy thirst is good magic items.</p>
<p>Magic items in my games are more like Arcana from Into the Odd or Stonetop. So they don’t just make you better at hitting things, but each create new play opportunities (e.g a padlock that can seal any room and place a ghost inside, a mushroom that will let you enter the mind of a dead person it grew on, but will make the person who ingested it seem dead, a seal that will summon a demon, but have no way on controlling it etc.). This still makes the player characters feel more powerful (they have a wider breath of choices for their approach), but it avoids growing the numbers on a character sheet.</p>
<p>I guess it is similar to accumulating of tech in Traveller mentioned before.</p>

              <p>This is largely what Star Trek Adventures is about re: character advancement. The characters start off as highly functional Starfleet officers; in some cases, you might even be playing the captain or XO, meaning there’s not really a lot of in-game promotions or mechanical growth to look forward to.</p>
<p>So it sort of requires a different mindset to approaching the game. It’s not about leveling up and unlocking the next feat or perk or more awesome gear or uber stats. It’s about exploring the characters, their interations, the galaxy, the unknown, etc. As long as the players grok that character advancement isn’t really the point of the game, a good time can be had. Some players and GMs really struggle with the distinction.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to see how much e.g. D&amp;D drifts towards combat. I think that has both to do with the big focus on combat rules and monsters to defeat, also xp rewarding such (at least traditionally).</p>

              <p>That’s where “long campaign” starts for me, too! I ask because at this point I have little experience with genuinely looooooong campaigns, like 40 or 140 sessions. For our definition of long campaign, I really don’t think XP or any mechanical incentive is necessary, personally. Offer interesting choices and challenges and stuff to do and focus on the sort of arcs players are articulating for their characters. Either your friends are into it or they aren’t, and if they aren’t, talk about what you all want.</p>

              <p>Personally, I like XP levelling in my games not because “I’m here to level up!”, but because it tells me what the game cares about. That becomes the incentive system, and I like the game telling me what is valuable.</p>
<p>So, for ex, in Blades, you gain XP both for your character’s specific stuff, and a bunch of general marks. Including rolling in desperate circumstances. So, the game rewards those actions.</p>
<p>Some versions of D&amp;D meld XP and GP gain, so the game is meaningfully about loot.</p>
<p>I find that really useful, as a player, to know where I should direct my attentions and what I should strive for.</p>

              <p>I’ve rarely, if ever, used XP to drive a campaign. The one exception might be glory in Pendragon, where the outward manifestation of glory was much more important than the leveling up aspect.</p>
<p>There have been some amazing responses to this already, many that have included stuff I came here to reply.</p>
<p>I guess the biggest issue is why are your players playing? If it because they are XP driven, then any given RPG board game would probably work as well as RPGs for their gaming enjoyment.</p>
<p>I’ve never played Troika, but I think the kinds of stories the system is designed to facilitate would help you to find the right carrots. Why do you love Troika? What are your favorite elements? How can those facilitate greater player involvement/buy in? That’s currency you use to replace the XP market.</p>
<p>As Julian inferred, Traveller does this XP replacement through accumulation of technology or resources.  Some games could use social entanglements or resolution, while others could expand the realm in which they operate.</p>
<p>But really, why Troika? I’m interested in hearing more.</p>

              <p>I stopped using XP as a mechanic years ago when I ran a superhero campaign and the kind of advancement that XP systems create didn’t seem to fit the genre.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve never used XP again. My reason for this is that its such a strong incentive, it tends to focus attention on mechanical character advancement. To me, that feels like a distraction from the kind of socially oriented, character based game I want to run. (No prob if others like it! Each according to their own…)</p>
<p>I’m not much of a rebel in my own scene: Of all the campaigns I’ve played in, only a small minority used XP. I do realize I may be in a non-representative section of the international rpg community…</p>
<p>In superhero games, a from of character progression did appear, but very stealthily. What happened was that the players got increasingly clever at using their characters, especially together, making them significantly more effective at the end of the campaign.</p>

              <p>I’ve run several Marvel Heroic campaigns where because we’re using established heroes, there really isn’t any room for ‘zero to hero’ advancement like in most F20 games. So we did what the book recommends and created a slate of ‘unlockables’ that PCs could spend xp on.</p>
<p>Like, you could burn xp to call in Nick Fury to help you out of a jam, or to introduce a supporting character from the comics, or to borrow one of the Avengers’ quinjets for a mission or something. So, they were using it to enhance play and ‘build’ their PCs, but not by adding to stats and powers. If you want a reasonable flat power curve across your campaign, this seems to work pretty well.</p>

              <p>I’m curious as to what you mean by “the XP gain carrot”?  Simply a points collection system for advancement or something bigger - a lack of mechanical character advancement and improvement over time?</p>
<p>If it’s the first there’s plenty who will tell you it’s easy - just use milestone leveling.  I personally dislike that system, but for scene driven or plotted campaigns I can see how it works fine. It’s harder to work with in a sandbox system of course.</p>
<p>If it’s mechanical advancement (leveling/skill improvement and ability gain) more broadly I suspect you’ll have to rely on player goals.  Goals from survival/wealth acquisition to solving world threatening problems.  While a base/town building mechanic (something as simple as the party being the hunters/scavengers for a band of survivors/refugees) could work - helping the players develop individual character goals through play has encouraged long term play in my experience because it’s not entirely top down and GM driven.  Faction interaction is good to establish this - NPCs that the players can like or hate, help or thwart - all with goals that have setting altering effects.</p>

<p>I tried to make an overview of the alternatives at one point:</p>
<p>Besides advancement a campaign might be propelled by…</p>
<p>decline. A downward spiral. Delta Green or The One Ring do this.</p>
<p>character change. Fate with its milestones tries to do that.</p>
<p>an arms race. Shadowrun.</p>
<p>base building. The Ark in Mutant: Year Zero.</p>
<p>networking. Expanding a relationship map, watching it grow or change. Hillfolk is an example. Also maybe building reputation in a more resource-focused sense.</p>
<p>chronicling. Generational play in a year-by-year mode. Pendragon and The One Ring.</p>
<p>anthologizing. Episodes tied together by returning characters or factions. Remember Tomorrow has it.</p>
<p>changing the setting and/or mode of play. Kuro, Makkura, Kuro Tensei. The Veil, The Veil: Cascade, The Veil: Inheritance.</p>
<p>exploration. Hexcrawls or other kinds of strongly map-focused gaming.</p>
<p>investigation. Follow the clues. Trail of Cthulhu’s Spine or Night’s Black Agents Conspyramid.</p>
<p>questions. The Uniform Survey in Sign in Stranger.</p>
<p>railroading. Many a published campaign.</p>

              <p>I think this largely comes down to the tastes of the people in the group. I’ve played with folks who really want to level up and pick powers from a list between sessions, and I’ve played with folks who don’t care if there’s no advancement at all. (Troika is in between, at least, as you do get to mark skills as you use them for a chance to improve them.)</p>
<p>If you think your players need more incentive, consider bolting on something like the Dungeon World end of session move, or expand Troika XP to allow it to gain new skills if you try them untrained enough times. If you think your players don’t need that specifically,  but still need to be hooked somehow, consider narrative hooks like a mission or a looming threat. But personally I would just try to run it as written and only try to find a solution if it turns out there is indeed a problem.</p>
