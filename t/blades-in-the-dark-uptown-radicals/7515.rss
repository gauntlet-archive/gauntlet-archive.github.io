    <description>This is a run of three sessions of *Blades in the Dark* in December, with the *Cult* crew.

Session 1: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MmNNFQWKPr6UIjfmDY0

Session 2: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MmNNxYbktqnHi0tfWT7

Session 3: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MmNOB6T40sYldXk6Mkc

---
You have been enlightened. A demonic entity has opened your eyes about everything that is wrong about Doskvol, the Shattered Isles, the Immortal Emperor and the present way of life. You have been given a mandate to bring long-awaited change to this decaying world. Do you rebuild, or do you destroy everything for the New World to rise from the ashes? Can your god give you all the answers?

And how do you do all this while keeping your position in the city elite?

[Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/) is a game about a crew of daring scoundrels seeking their fortunes on the haunted streets of an industrial-fantasy city.

Characters will belong to a  **Cult**  crew, but instead of starting from the bottom, they will be from the upper classes — nobles, magistrates, academics, priests, etc. They&#39;ll be subverting the establishment while at the same time being a part of the very establishment they are fighting against.

*This session is a part of a three-session run. Being able to attend every session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend.*

Content Warning: violence, murder, cults, religion, politics.

Duration: 3 hours.

Breaks: Two 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

Safety Tools: X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy. This event will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)

Setup: We&#39;ll use  **Zoom**  for communication, and the [ **Role VTT** ](https://www.playrole.com/) for character sheets, info, maps and dice.

Recording: Sessions will be recorded, but will only be posted with full player consent. Currently the plan is to record only for the facilitator’s reference.

Rules will be taught -- no prior knowledge is required.

Participants will be sent more information a week before the game.

RSVP open access time: 22 October 2021 18:00 UTC
