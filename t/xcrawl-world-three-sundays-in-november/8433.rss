# **Xcrawl World**

Fabulous prizes! Cars, wealth, and a year’s supply of furniture wax! All of these – and much, much more – can be yours… if you survive.

Of course, you are going to have to kill some monsters to get the treasure. And you aren’t the crowd favorite today. And the cameras are very unforgiving. But there are no second takes, and if you die… **YOU DIE!**

In Xcrawl, the player characters are superstar athletes taking their chances in a live-on-pay-per-view death sport. It’s a modern-day world with a fantasy twist, and the game is simple: the Dungeon Judge, or DJ, facilitates an artificial dungeon under controlled – but lethal – conditions. Your team of Xcrawlers must go through the dungeon and fulfill whatever conditions the DJ puts forth in order to win.

-----------------------------------

*This is my Xcrawl PbtA hack inspired by Jen Kitzman&#39;s Vagabonds of Xcrawl, using Jeremy Strandberg&#39;s Homebrew World hack of Dungeon World to create a fun and quick RPG of televised game-show extreme dungeon-crawling. This game session will be the first playtest of this franken-game. I anticipate some awesomeness, but there might be some missing pieces I hadn&#39;t considered. Please sign up if you&#39;re willing to be forgiving and helpful.*

-----------------------------------

I have saved some spots for folks from the GCOG session I had to cancel.
