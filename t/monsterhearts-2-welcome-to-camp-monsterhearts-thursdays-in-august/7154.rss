    <title>Monsterhearts 2: Welcome to Camp Monsterhearts! (Thursdays in August)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/monsterhearts-2-welcome-to-camp-monsterhearts-thursdays-in-august/7154</link>
    <description>This is for a four-session run of *Monsterhearts 2* , scheduled for 8pm US Eastern time on Thursdays in August. Tone is aiming for classic angsty teen Monsterhearts with a splash of classic teen summer camp horror. No prior familiarity with the rules is expected. I will send out a group email about a week before the first session to confirm everyone’s intent to play and to provide set-up and invitation details. A fourth seat is being held for Ferret of the Gauntlet community.

*Welcome to Camp Winding Woods! Situated along beautiful Woodpecker Lake in idyllic northern Minnesota, our mission is to help young people like yourselves learn important teamwork, leadership, and problem solving skills in a safe and fun outdoor setting, far away from the distractions of WiFi or cell service, where you&#39;ll meet lifelong friends and make memories that last a lifetime! Whether you&#39;re new to camp or have been coming for ages, we&#39;ve got a great line-up of activities planned for you this year, from sporty to artsy! Just remember to follow camp rules at all times, and don&#39;t let those stories about virgin-eating werewolves in the woods get to you! So--who&#39;s ready for summer!? I can&#39;t HEEEEEEEAR you! That&#39;s more like it!*
