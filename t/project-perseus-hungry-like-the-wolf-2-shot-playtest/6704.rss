*****For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you joined the Gauntlet Community in the last 6 months, or if you&#39;ve had a hard time getting into games.*****

**This game is part of an open playtest to help improve the game. Please only sign up if you&#39;re okay with providing feedback through a survey after the sessions!**

**Project: Perseus is a game about superspies and their handlers fighting in the shadows against supernatural conspiracies and rival agencies during the late &#39;80s and early &#39;90s. (For this game, we&#39;ve set things in the 80s because I need any excuse to use 80s music as a soundtrack for a game!)** We play to find out if the Agents can outwit, outrun, or outfight their opponents while finding a balance of trust with their Operators—which may not be easy, as some Agents may not have the same objectives and agendas on the mission. This is a game inspired by superspy movies like James Bond or Atomic Blonde, classic government agency shows like Alias, Ghost in the Shell, or Witch Hunter Robin, and urban fantasy novels.

**Please note: This is a game with asymmetric player roles. One of the players will be an Operator, while the rest will play as Agents.**

**CW: supernatural horror, romance, possible betrayal, violence.**

**System** : [Project Perseus](https://www.evilhat.com/home/project-perseus/) (open playtest), rule will be taught in play

**Duration**  : Two 3 hour sessions

**Breaks**  : 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : Yes, but only if all players consent to recording and publishing

**Attendance**  : Joining all sessions is ideal but not required, this game is very drop in and drop out friendly.

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, an open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

**Open access** : Public signs up are available at 3/18/2021 10PM (Manila Time)
