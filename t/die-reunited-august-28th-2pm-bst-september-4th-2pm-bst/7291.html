          <p>This is a playtest of <a href="http://diecomic.com/rpg" rel="nofollow noopener">DIE</a> RPG by (er) me. DIE RPG is based on <a href="https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/www.diecomic.com" rel="nofollow noopener">the comic series DIE</a>, by Stephanie Hans and (er) me.</p>
<p>DIE has been in development for a few years, and I want to take the current core game - DIE CORE - out for a spin to try some things. <a href="https://kierongillen.itch.io/die-beta/devlog/283327/die-rpg-146" rel="nofollow noopener">This will be the recently released 1.46 beta classes</a> and the basic scenario of the game.</p>
<p>This is the first of two sessions. The first session is 3 hours, the second is 4. Attendance at both sessions is definitely advantageous, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.</p>
<p><strong>Concept</strong> : To create a group of flawed, real world human beings (“Persona”), role-play them sitting down to play a fantasy role-playing game… and then have them transported to a fantasy world. Will they get home or not? What will they discover about themselves when they’re there? What will they do (or not) to get what they always wanted?</p>
<p>We’ll be playtesting a specific playset REUNITED which is based on the following concept:  <em>“You all used to play fantasy RPGs together as teenagers at school. Now years down the line, you’re all back in town for a school re-union and have decided to get together to play a game for old time’s sake…”</em></p>
<p><strong>Aim:</strong>  To quote from the manual:  <em>“The aim of the game is to explore who these people really are.”</em>  It’s somewhat meta game about a group of people playing RPGs which uses the fantasy adventure to externalize their own lacks and issues.</p>
<p><strong>Tone:</strong>  Will be somewhat negotiated at the table. To quote the manual:  <em>“DIE can become an existential weird horror game, or can be a portal-fantasy romp - what do the players want?”</em>  What do the players want is very much part of the game - why do we play Fantasy games anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Subject Matter:</strong>  Will vary depending on the Persona’s own nature, but takes the backbone of a fantasy adventure, twisted. Common themes are the loss of dreams, the compromises of adulthood, regrets. Player versus Player conflict is a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Venue</strong> : Sessions will be recorded via Streamyard and may be posted on Youtube if folks are cool with that.</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong> : Players will be contacted about a week before the game, where advance material will be mailed over. If no contact is heard from a player before 24 hours in the game it will be assumed they can’t make it, and their place will be offered up.</p>
<p>The X-card will be in use, as will the<a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">  <strong>Gauntlet Code of Conduct</strong> </a>. We’ll run with Open Door, and Lines &amp; Veils will be defined before the game.</p>
