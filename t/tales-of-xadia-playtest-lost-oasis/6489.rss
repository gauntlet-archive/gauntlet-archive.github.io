This is a playtest of [Tales of Xadia](https://www.talesofxadia.com/), a game currently in development based on the Netflix animated series The Dragon Prince, using the [Cortex Prime](https://www.cortexrpg.com/) engine. The Dragon Prince is a children&#39;s fantasy series about a world where humans and elves have come into conflict, though this playtest will be run using a pre-written scenario which features adult protagonists, Lost Oasis. Sessions will be three hours in length, and there is the possibility we may complete the scenario in the first two sessions, though I&#39;ve scheduled three for insurance and to give us sufficient time. Because this is a playtest of a pre-written, self-contained scenario I ask that people only sign up if they can make all three sessions, and I may not draw from the waitlist if we have an unexpected absence part way through the run. Please be aware that clocks change in March and if you are outside of Europe relative start times may be subject to variance.. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (February 10th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants. 

After counting yourselves lucky not to have suffered an ill fate at the battle outside of the Storm Spire, a mysterious tomb-delving Moonshadow elf named Feathershawl has commissioned your rag-tag crew to investigate an abandoned city floating high across the Xadian sky. The island is on a collision course with a mountain range at the border, and the clock is ticking to salvage a rare artifact from it; you don’t have time to do your own research before you leave. 

Content Warnings:  This is a game based on a children&#39;s TV series and as such content should be broadly on a line with that. The game will feature the potential for fantasy violence, conflict between fantasy races, natural disaster, and risk to civilians. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
