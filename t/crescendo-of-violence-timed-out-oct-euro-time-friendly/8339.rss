    <title>Crescendo of Violence: Timed Out (Oct, Euro-Time Friendly)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/crescendo-of-violence-timed-out-oct-euro-time-friendly/8339</link>
    <description>This is for a series of four sessions of *Crescendo of Violence: A Neon-Noir RPG* releasing at the end of September. Rules will be taught Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. In session one we will create characters, discuss safety &amp; tone, pick and detail characters, build connections, and set up our story arc. General RSVPs open 8/27. 

*2093, Neo York. A dystopian technological marvel, where concrete high-rises brim with holographic neon, as gilded mob bosses, flashy CEOs, and famous vid-stars all strive to consolidate their power over the masses. And while the rain reflects the neon, it never washes away the grime and filth of the streets.*

*Welcome to a world of synth-jazz and cybernetics, where the status quo grinds down the hard-working man and vat-grown clone alike. Whether you&#39;re the redemption-seeking gangster, the one good cop in a corrupt system, or the gene-modded musician trying to make it big, you&#39;ll be trying to get by in a city that just doesn&#39;t care.*
 
*Epic fight scenes take centre stage in this game of stylised, high-octane bloodshed. Jump straight into the action with a unique ruleset designed to deliver a cinematic, neon-noir experience, as the spotlight focuses on the brutal showdowns that will define you - or leave you face-down in the dirt. So get ready to give them hell, as the sultry notes of the saxophone build into a crescendo of violence.*

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. Because this series is being done in part for review purposes, I am planning to record. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
