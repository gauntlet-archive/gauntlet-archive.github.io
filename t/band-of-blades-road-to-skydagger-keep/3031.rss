I have a free spot in the first session of my Band of Blades game
[date=2019-09-04 time=19:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Oslo&quot;] → [date=2019-09-04 time=23:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Oslo&quot;]
Sign up here: [https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Ll1Es6VW2-bTJo746OQ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Ll1Es6VW2-bTJo746OQ)

The game is open for anyone to sign up, so if you have been curious about gaming with The Gauntlet, you have a chance to try now!

The Legion is in retreat following a failed battle against the armies of the undead. You are a member of the Legion, your bonds to one another forged in the dark by bone and blood. But time is running out as more fall to the indomitable forces of the Cinder King. As Legionnaires, you must make it to Skydagger Keep before you’re cut off or overtaken by the undead. Paying horrifying costs, you’ll employ offensives, maneuvers, unwise bargains, and desperate gambits as the ever-ticking clock nears its final hour. Do you have what it takes to outwit, outrun, and outlast the endless hordes of the undead, or will your band of blades break beneath the Cinder King’s iron fist? Play to find out in  *Band of Blades* , a stand-alone,  *Forged in the Dark*  RPG of dark military fantasy.  Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. This game will be recorded.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.</description>
