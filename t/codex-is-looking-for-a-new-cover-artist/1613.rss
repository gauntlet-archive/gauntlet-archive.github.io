    <description>The Codex team is beginning its search for the Volume 4 cover artist! 

Here are the details:

* The artist should have a distinct style and should feel comfortable creating a cover illustration based off a minimal brief. 
* Each cover illustration is black &amp; white plus one theme color. 
* The commitment is for 6 cover illustrations, delivered monthly. We pay $75 USD for each cover illustration upon delivery. 
* The artist will have the option of doing 3 more covers after their initial commitment of 6. We pay $100 USD for each of the 3 additional covers. 
* Detailed usage terms will be negotiated with whoever we select, but generally, we ask for the right to use the cover illustrations for their respective issue of Codex, compilations that include those issues, and for promotion on social media. The illustrations otherwise belong to the artist, though we ask they not be used for another game project. 

If you are interested, please include a link to samples of your work in the replies or send a message to gauntletpublish at gmail dot com. Artists who are members of a marginalized community are strongly encouraged to apply!

ALSO: if you are unfamiliar with Codex, there is more information (plus a free issue) on our website: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/codex.html</description>
