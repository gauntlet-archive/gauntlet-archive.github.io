    <description>Blades in the Dark: Inferno

“An inferno starts with a spark.” - Emeline Danfield, Doskvol Academy Professor of Criminology

“Burn it all down!” - Ogre the Smoke, The Grinders

Inferno is the story of a crew of upstarts as they strive to make it big in The Dusk. The series is meant to engage a core idea of Blades, in that members may come and go as time passes, but The Crew carries on.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>This series is intended to become an ongoing story over the course of the remainder of 2022 and 2023, made up of intermittent runs (every other month or few months). Returning players will have the right of first refusal. There is no commitment beyond any individual series/run of usually 4 sessions.</p>
<p>Players will choose a Crew Type that will define the crew for future series, though crew types can be changed if it seems appropriate later. All playbooks are available, including third-party playbooks if players want to do the work of importing them into Roll20.</p>
<p>We’ll use a ‘vanilla/classic’ approach to the rules, but if you sign up, prepare to have some things hand-waved.</p>
<p>CONTENT WARNING: Violence, poverty, classism, substance abuse, cults, the supernatural, romance.</p>
<p>SESSIONS: 4</p>
<p>DURATION: 3 hours.</p>
<p>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Three players in addition to the facilitator.</p>
<p>SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy, Stars &amp; Wishes. The game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>VENUE/TECH: Zoom Video, Roll20, Google Sheets for record-keeping. Expect an email one week before the first session, and another shortly before the session.</p>
<p>BREAKS: Two 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.</p>
<p>RECORDING: Sessions will be recorded, but would only be posted with full enthusiastic player consent.  Currently the plan is to record only for the facilitator’s reference.</p>
<p>PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: None – rules will be taught in play.</p>
<p>Session 1 Monday May 2</p>
