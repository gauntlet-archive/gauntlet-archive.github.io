    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/item-crafting-in-your-games/1088</link>
    <description>Ok folks.  Here&#39;s a topic I like.

Are there basic tenets of item crafting that you follow?  What are your favorite rulesets for it?  Are there any games you never let people craft items?

I&#39;ve never found a crafting system that works well, but I&#39;ve found in games with enough downtime to do crafting erring on the side of too long was better than the other way.

I&#39;ll post again when I find my Kingmaker game&#39;s crafting rules, bc I felt like it worked pretty well for my group.</description>

              <p>Shadowrun had incredible system that I think can count as crafting. It was more modding mostly (especially with vehicles), but you could do wonderful things with it. Of course it was very trad and very very extensive, but it gave a lot of space to tinker and play.</p>

              <p>I’ve also been hacking <em>Anima Prime</em> to run the setting of <em>Exalted</em> for years. Since you can craft some cool stuff in <em>Exalted</em>, with some killer ingredients, I tried to get a crafting system going in that rule set.</p>
<p>The main thing I’m aiming for is a system where a) no one character can be good at everything and b) each type of crafting requires the output of other types of crafting to work. The idea being that characters can’t just craft in a bottle, and that the needs of crafting will create goals that the players will have to pursue, driving play. When characters are deep in the shit solely so that one of them can get the magic pixie dust they need to finish their artificial man, the system works as intended.</p>

              <p>In <em>Fourth World</em>, my drift of <em>Dungeon World</em> to the setting of <em>Earthdawn</em>, people can get corrupted by alien evil. When they do, they first thing to go is their ability to be creative. So, the culture of the world has evolved such that creating art is the main way you demonstrate to others that you haven’t been corrupted. Everyone who can make art does regularly.</p>
<p>This leads to a lot of crafting. This is handled mechanically by the addition of a single “Create Art” move, which serves its function fine, though could maybe be better.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was gonna say:  the Savvyhead workshop move (or more broadly, its structure) is my favorite implementation of “crafting,” mostly because it scales perfectly to the sensibilities of the GM/players and the world they’re building.</p>

              <p>I play Ars Magica - that game has very clear and complex rules on how to craft items, and we use them extensively. We’ve had floating belts, potions that let you forget the last 13 years, lots of demon-destroying staves and a stone that would create a stone bridge.</p>
<p>The rules let us determine how long it takes to create such items. But the game is actually skewed towards mages and the play rhythm is determined by increments of magical study.</p>
<p>In other games, I remember Dresden Files RPG, where we had some items created. I usually err on the side favoring the players, because I actually like them to create stuff.</p>
