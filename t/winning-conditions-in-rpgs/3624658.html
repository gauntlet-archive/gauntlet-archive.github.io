          <p>I‚Äôve played both a one-shot LARP and a big group wargame ( please bear with me) that had a very similar way of determining winner(s) that might be worth considering.</p>
<p>As a note, neither announced these ways prior to the end of the game, so perhaps they didn‚Äôt exactly encourage certain play behaviors the way they would have were they known in advance.</p>
<p>In the LARP, at the end of play, everyone was gathered together ion a circle, and then a sort of bragging session/debrief happened. Each player had 1-2 minutes to re-introduce their character( the play group was big enough that you may have only interacted with their character briefly or not at all)and talk about how far they had gotten on accomplishing their character‚Äôs goals ( often your character had multiple goals, not all of which were fully pursuable in the allotted play time). After everyone finished, the group nominated a couple of players ( GMs aided in narrowing the numbers down to just a couple of players ) and the in-fiction winner was chosen by vote-by-applause.</p>
<p>After that, a second of round of voting produced an MVP ( Most Valuable Player) award as well. This was for a player who contributed most to the overall fun of the LARP play, not necessarily succeeded as their character.</p>
<p>( Yes I won that, and yes I was super pleased <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/blushc164.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"> )</p>
<p>In the big convention group wargame, they really just jumped to the second type ( MVP) award when the time was up for the game. A round robin verbal debrief wasn‚Äôt really necessary as everyone playing had seen the game-state at the end of play time. Also, MVP here was kind of nice because it was a war game with wildly lopsided results, in a genre of wargame that often has wildly lopsided results ( Late 1800s Colonialism. It‚Äôs rare for the locals to win solidly, and even when they do, rarely without absurdly awful casualties).</p>
<p>Yes, I got that one too <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smilec164.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">. Apparently I was an awful tactician even for someone playing the outgunned locals, but apparently made the game fun for other people.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that you can have win conditions. But, there need not be  a single person as the sole winner of the gold medal, so to speak.</p>
<p>You could have multiple winners, and winners in different categories (outside of in-character, in-fiction wins) and even a well-planned debrief method can let people brag a bit about what they accomplished and get some decent encouragement and recognition, without going absurdly competitive.</p>

          <p>I don‚Äôt think the idea of winning / losing an RPG is anything new, but it‚Äôs definitely a difficult thing to do with nuance. It is used a lot more frequently for short campaigns or one-shot games than longer form campaigns. I agree that a win condition does motivate similarly to experience, but game length is a factor here. Getting ‚Äúpoints‚Äù is a great motivator, which works well when your games win condition is not easily or visibly attainable.</p>
<p>I, like others in this thread, have been working with the concept in my own game. It‚Äôs focused on the long term competitive, short term cooperative flow of play to build up a sense of paranoia and ultimately betrayal. I think there is an excitement that comes with social competition with players that is harder to achieve when fighting against the dice or the narrative, but it also can make things less friendly and more aggressive (obviously). It isn‚Äôt a game style that can fit every group.</p>
<p>Multiple winners seems like an interesting method, but I think it undercuts a lot of the excitement of competition. That is, if there isn‚Äôt a large enough group to keep ‚Äúwinners‚Äù relatively scarce.</p>

          <p>It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve read it, let alone played it, but <em>Burning Empires</em> had a pretty clear meta narrative and win conditions.</p>
<p>I was really happy with it, though I ran it. I had one player really not like how little influence they felt they had on the overarching narrative and phases, whereas the other players were totally there for it.</p>

          <p>For most RPGs, the default assumption is that the player and the character are aligned in their goals, I.e. the player wants to see the character succeed. So the game doesn‚Äôt actually need an explicit win condition for the players, because that would be redundant. The point of a win condition is to motivate players in a specific direction. If you‚Äôre already motivated to make your PC succeed in their goals (whatever they are) then you don‚Äôt need an additional incentive.</p>
<p>But a win condition could be interesting or useful when the goals of the player and the goals of the character aren‚Äôt the same. In a game about comedic or dramatic irony, you might set up the player‚Äôs goals to be opposed to the character‚Äôs, so that the player who wins is the one who pushes against their own character‚Äôs goals the most, causing entertaining dramatic interactions. In a horror game, this might mean putting your character into the most danger by going along into the woods at night with a broken flashlight, even though we know what might happen. In Paul Czege‚Äôs <em>The Valedictorian‚Äôs Death</em>, each murder suspect was trying to be the most suspicious person who wasn‚Äôt arrested for the murder, which motivates players to describe their characters in a suspicious manner, but be careful not to incriminate themselves.</p>

          <p>Space Wurm vs Moonicorn has win conditions for the title characters, either control the universe or liberate the people respectively. It helps to drive the conflict in a specific direction. The campaign ends when one of those characters succeeds at their objective, but it‚Äôs kind of one of those ‚Äúthe real Space Wurm was the friends we made along the way‚Äù kinda of things</p>
