          <p><em>Once, you were a crew of smugglers, ne’er-do-wells, scoundrels with a heart of gold, getting into and out of scrapes with the heavy-handed authorities. Maybe you started a revolution. Maybe you caused an the Grand Reptile’s empire to fall. You made some money, that’s for sure, and got a few scars, some more sexy than others.</em></p>
<p><em>Then you split up, maybe you just wanted peace, or your own island, or you were a functionary in the newly-minted alliance for freedom or something like that. Maybe you were just fed up with everyone’s bullshit. You’ve avoided each other ever since, so it’s probably the last one.</em></p>
<p><em>But now your old Captain is back with a final mission. Your old enemy, the Grand Reptile, appears to be back, and they seem to be stronger - and richer - than ever. You need to confront them, take them down, or finally figure out what it was all about. Are you with the Captain?</em></p>
<p>This is a game of Once More Into the Void, by Jamile Nedjadi. It’s been financed on Kickstarter recently, but a playable version is already out, so we’ll use this (unless a newer version appears,) We’ll aim for three session so we’ll have enough time to develop the characters and the setting - it’s possible that we finish in two sessions, but we’ll talk about that if &amp; when it happens.</p>
<p>The default setting for Once More Into the Void is a science-fiction-setting, so we’ll go with that. Everything else we’ll just make up during the session. It’s a gm-ful game, so I’ll facilitate and guide, but I’ll play a character as well.</p>
<p>Kalum will be a guest star for these games.</p>
<p>Being able to attend all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.</p>
<p>No experience is needed; everything will be taught in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Venue</strong> : Zoom</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong> : Players will receive an e-mail to check in about a week before the start of the game.</p>
<p>We will discuss Content, Aim, Tone, and Safety Tools in the first sessions. We will use Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door policy, and I will prepare a character keeper as a shared document.</p>
<p>The  <strong>Gauntlet Code of Conduct</strong>  will be in effect for this gam <strong>e</strong>  (<a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html</a>)!</p>
