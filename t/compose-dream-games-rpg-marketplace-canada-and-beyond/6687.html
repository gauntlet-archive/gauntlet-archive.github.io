          <p><strong>New Canadian Publishers to the Marketplace in 2021:</strong><br>
Here‚Äôs a run down of new publishers and designers who joined the marketplace in 2021. With comments on some of their products.</p>
<p><strong>A Smouldering Lighthouse</strong><br>
Has released their first 2 games this year. Both are GMless story-games.<br>
<em>This Spells Trouble</em> is a game about isolationist wizards making a mess of things when they go into the world, with a card for each of the spirits they can summon.<br>
<em>Faewater</em> is a one-page dark fantasy game about underwater fairies and the mortals they prey on. Both are free with a tip the creator option.<br>
<a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/A-Smouldering-Lighthouse-Manufacturer" rel="nofollow noopener">A Smouldering Lighthouse</a></p>
<p><strong>Alicia Furness Publishing</strong><br>
Joined with 2 titles.<br>
<em>Camp Flying Moose</em> , a powered by the Apocalypse game about a summer camp for teenage girls which probably has some monsters too.<br>
While in <em>Identity</em> you are a clone trying desperately to escape the corporation that created you. <em>Identity</em> uses the Wretched engine ‚Äì you use a jenga tower, and a deck of cards and 10 tokens, and it is geared for solo play (but rules for more players are included.)<br>
<a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/Alicia-Furness" rel="nofollow noopener">Alicia Furness</a></p>
<p><strong>Chris Challice Books</strong><br>
Chris has two free <em>Choose Your Own Fate</em> books, and a <em>Troika</em> based game born out of nostalgic love for old-school console adventure games <em>Oroboros</em> .<br>
He‚Äôs also one of the designers of Pendelhaven‚Äôs <em>Vanagard</em> and their adventure <em>Seith and Sword</em> .<br>
<a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/random-alien-games" rel="nofollow noopener">https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/chris-challice</a></p>
<p><strong>Random Alien Games</strong><br>
Creator of <em>Free Spacer</em> , a sandbox starship RPG, using their own ‚Äúsalvo‚Äù game engine. And yes, you can generate completely random aliens with this game. As well as random solar systems, planets and more.<br>
<a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/random-alien-games" rel="nofollow noopener">Random Alien Games</a></p>
<p><strong>Pendelhaven</strong><br>
Creators of an array of Runic Game System games where you resolve actions by drawing rune stones from a bag. Including <em>Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok</em> , <em>Vanagard</em> , and the newly released Children of Eiru (we‚Äôll be getting that soon!).<br>
All games are deeply mythologically based. Those looking to get there hands directly on the mythology are encourage to get their <em>Illuminated Edda</em> , and <em>Celtic Cyclopedia</em> , or even one of their <em>Creatures of Fairy-Tale and Myth</em> for mythlogically grounded takes on monsters.<br>
<a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/pendelhaven" rel="nofollow noopener">Pendelhaven</a></p>
<p><strong>Broken Things</strong><br>
Broken Things joined with their game <em>Inspire</em> , a GMless story-game where you play a spirit hoping to become a god. ‚ÄúThe kind of spirit that may one day become a god. Those other people around the table with you? Maybe they‚Äôre going to end up being on the same pantheon as you. Someone needs to be at the top of this pecking order though. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to find out as you shape the first generations of this community, each spirit trying to be the one who saves the day, and ultimately become the head of your pantheon.‚Äù<br>
