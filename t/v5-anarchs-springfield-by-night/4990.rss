Vampire: the Masquerade 5th Edition – Anarchs in Springfield, Illinois

The major Camarilla city of Chicago is a gem, a perfect rotten jewel in the crown of the Camarilla. However the State capital has been seized by the Anarchs several years back and has been able to repel efforts to take it back since their coup.

You are part of these Anarchs, keeping order and equality amongst your peers. This is a game about freedom from blood tyranny and maybe just a bit of hypocrisy along with the Camarilla vs Anarchs political set up.

This is a WoD game and all books necessary to play will be available to all players. New players are encouraged to try out.
