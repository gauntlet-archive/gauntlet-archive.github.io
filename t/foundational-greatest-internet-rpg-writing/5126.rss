    <description>Saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/redford/status/1255330066151718912?s=21) today and one of the first answers that sprung to mind was [Ben Robbins’s West Marches post](http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/). While obviously not germane to that conversation, Ben’s post (and his follow-ups), to my mind, sent a shockwave through the ttrpg world. Not only did it launch a thousand West Marches knockoffs, you can see its influence in the OSR and the reemergence of sandbox play.

I’m curious: What are the other foundational works of internet writing about ttrpgs, in your eyes? Blog posts, forum posts, etc. but specific *pieces*, not people, games, or full blogs.

EDITED TO ADD: Please include a link if possible! Hopefully this can be useful as library of important online RPG writing.</description>

<p>Hearing that I’m not the only who likes to feel this kind of thing when playing went pretty directly to some deep desires and interests I have and really love getting at in this hobby. I think it’s a wonderful little essay, and talks about something powerful which is rarely presented so honestly in this hobby. It affected me quite deeply.</p>

<p>I believe that dungeons should always be heavily jaquayed.…Okay, it’s true. I’m just making words up now. In the case of jaquaying, the term is referring to Jennell Jaquays, who design</p>

              <p>Well, there’s a bunch of original Forge threads that might be considered foundational RPG writing, but I am going to break a lance in favour of Ron Edward’s essay “System does Matter”.</p>

<p>It’s a bit old and uses some outdated language, and the old GNS distinctions make less sense as time goes on, but it still stands as a strong affirmation that <em>yes, you can change the procedures of play and get a different game experience</em>, and that idea, at that time, where a lot of people were saying that System <strong>didn’t</strong> matter, was revolutionary, and affected the RPG landscape in so many ways.</p>

              <p>Saw <a href="https://twitter.com/redford/status/1255330066151718912?s=21" rel="nofollow noopener">this tweet</a> today and one of the first answers that sprung to mind was <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/" rel="nofollow noopener">Ben Robbins’s West Marches post</a>. While obviously not germane to that conversation, Ben’s post (and his follow-ups), to my mind, sent a shockwave through the ttrpg world. Not only did it launch a thousand West Marches knockoffs, you can see its influence in the OSR and the reemergence of sandbox play.</p>
<p>I’m curious: What are the other foundational works of internet writing about ttrpgs, in your eyes? Blog posts, forum posts, etc. but specific <em>pieces</em>, not people, games, or full blogs.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: Please include a link if possible! Hopefully this can be useful as library of important online RPG writing.</p>
