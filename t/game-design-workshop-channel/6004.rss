    <description>On the slack, @Bethany_H mentioned setting up a virtual game design study hall as a way to help those of us who have difficulty getting anything done on our projects.

With the help of the ever-helpful Bob Abrazado this is now a reality! The Gauntlet discord is now set up with #design-shop channels (text as well as voice/video) for this very purpose.

So if you want some study-buddies to chat with or just have around while you work on your gaming projects, drop a line here, in the slack, or on the discord to let people know when you&#39;ll be around!</description>

              <p>Yeah, but I’m not sure it will work. It’s tricky to juggle the spirits, the Dahan, and the Invaders without making the Dahan very passive which isn’t a great fit.</p>
