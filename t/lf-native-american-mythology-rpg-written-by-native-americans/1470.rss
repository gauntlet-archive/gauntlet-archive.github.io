    <description>Is there such a thing? Here in Germany we tend to have some strong &quot;noble savage&quot; stereotypes in our head due to Karl May and his stories permeating the culture. However this has of course also instilled me with some interest in the matter. I have read some books but wondered if there was an RPG in that area that&#39;s not problematic in one way or another.</description>

<p>To add to this point, most First Nations folks that I know object to it because it flows from a long history of white peoples demonizing, infanilizing, and othering traditional beliefs. Not because the term itself couldn’t hold value, but the club it has been used as over time is still very visible in the word, especially when it comes from a settler academic perspective.</p>

              <p>Eh… maybe it’s the scholar in me, but I don’t think you need to bin the word mythology. In common usage, myth can mean “untrue story,” but that is not the only definition; in religious studies, myth/mythology are widely accepted and non-judgmental terms (though their precise definitions are debated). I think, in this case, mythology is an accurate phrase and probably okay to use, as long as it is used respectfully and non-dogmatically.</p>
<p>Especially since Ehdrigohr and Ohunkakan both use the terms “mythology” and “myths” to describe their settings. It’s even in Ohunkakan’s name!</p>

<p>Perhaps “belief system”?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Belief system would probably be the best term.</p>
<p>To give an example, calling tribal beliefs “myths” is the equivalent of me calling the scientific method a myth.</p>
<p>Which, you know, I <em>do</em> but not usually to people who hold Western science as a core part of their reality because it tends to upset them.</p>
<p>Jonathan already suggested the best example that comes to mind. It’s important to know that <em>Ehdrigohr</em> is from the point of view of one specific tribe and not all Native Americans, but that’s a big part of its strength: it  unapologetically leans into the author’s Lakota culture.</p>

              <p>I don’t believe there’s a “mythology” RPG (which again is a loaded term because for many of the people there it’s their faith and religion and not a mythology) but off hand there is Ehdrighor by Allen Turner (who is Lakota).</p>

              <p>Is there such a thing? Here in Germany we tend to have some strong “noble savage” stereotypes in our head due to Karl May and his stories permeating the culture. However this has of course also instilled me with some interest in the matter. I have read some books but wondered if there was an RPG in that area that’s not problematic in one way or another.</p>
