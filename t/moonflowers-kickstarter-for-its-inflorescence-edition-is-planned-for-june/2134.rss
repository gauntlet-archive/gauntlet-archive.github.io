    <title>Moonflower&#39;s Kickstarter for its inflorescence edition is planned for June</title>

    <description>EDIT: Please look at my latest post in this thread for update!

We are working on the next (and most likely final) iteration of moonflower, which we are dubbing the inflorescence edition. :slight_smile: 

![](/uploads/default/original/2X/6/65e7dcb3e69eeea975f85f2cd7f4af55b74c9cc8.gif)

moonflower is a story game guided by tarot cards, which tell the circumstances and hardships that the pilgrims must face on their journey to the Moon. It is a short and simple game, but the inflorescence edition will be richly illustrated and laid out.

If you are familiar with its previous iteration (most likely the itch version, as it&#39;s the only English-language version available), you may notice that there hasn&#39;t been substantial changes. The focus of this version was on trimming and neatifying, though we are considering expansion of the games part if there are demands for it. But the most important part is the look of the book, about which we aren&#39;t cutting corners.

That&#39;s why we are doing a crowdfunding project for it - we want it to be as pretty and pleasing as possible and to compensate the artists who have contributed to it as fairly and justly as possible. A successful campaign would allow us to work in bigger numbers, which will help us print in higher quality. Given funding, we will request more art from our artists at rates higher than most would.

Though the book will be in both Korean and English, the creative team behind the book are all Korean. This may be the first formal introduction of a Korean-made TTRPG to the wider world, which is a source of both honor and terror. :smiley: If you could, consider backing the project - perhaps it could lead to more Korean games being brought to the English-speaking world.

Please spread the news. We are excited to do this and a wide and positive reaction would encourage us more than anything else.</description>

<p>We are working on the next (and most likely final) iteration of moonflower, which we are dubbing the inflorescence edition. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>moonflower is a story game guided by tarot cards, which tell the circumstances and hardships that the pilgrims must face on their journey to the Moon. It is a short and simple game, but the inflorescence edition will be richly illustrated and laid out.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with its previous iteration (most likely the itch version, as it’s the only English-language version available), you may notice that there hasn’t been substantial changes. The focus of this version was on trimming and neatifying, though we are considering expansion of the games part if there are demands for it. But the most important part is the look of the book, about which we aren’t cutting corners.</p>
<p>That’s why we are doing a crowdfunding project for it - we want it to be as pretty and pleasing as possible and to compensate the artists who have contributed to it as fairly and justly as possible. A successful campaign would allow us to work in bigger numbers, which will help us print in higher quality. Given funding, we will request more art from our artists at rates higher than most would.</p>
<p>Though the book will be in both Korean and English, the creative team behind the book are all Korean. This may be the first formal introduction of a Korean-made TTRPG to the wider world, which is a source of both honor and terror. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> If you could, consider backing the project - perhaps it could lead to more Korean games being brought to the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>Please spread the news. We are excited to do this and a wide and positive reaction would encourage us more than anything else.</p>
