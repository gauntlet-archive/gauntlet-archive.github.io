    <description>I&#39;m looking for RPGs that my partner might like. He&#39;s described his favorite parts of games, and I&#39;d appreciate help identifying some keywords or genres I could use as search terms.

In general, he likes mechanically crunchy games focused on group problem solving.

In particular, he&#39;s looking for a games with fairly concrete and well-defined PC abilities. For example, he likes D&amp;D (at least, he liked 3.5 and 4e) because the skill list and other character abilities are clearly spelled out.

For example, he likes how in D&amp;D, if you want to pick a lock or move silently, you roll Lockpicking or Move Silently. In contrast, he is less of a fan of PbtA games where, if you wanted to pick a lock or move silently, you might roll to Do Something Under Fire (or a similar move). 

For his tastes, PbtA games are too mechanically simple (your roll +Cold for all Do Something Under Fire moves even though a character might be much better at picking locks than moving silently). He&#39;s also found them to too focused on relationships and interpersonal drama.

I *think* he might be looking for an Old School Revival game, but I don&#39;t know that genre very well. Do OSR games sound like something he&#39;d enjoy?

I&#39;d love to hear your game recommendations! Thank you!</description>

              <p>I second the suggestions made so far:<br>
+1 on OSR, Blades in the Dark, Gumshoe.</p>
<p>I find also Fate Core/Condensed (not FAE = Fate Accelerated) a good system with a solid generic skill set. You can get quite creative in collective problem solving by creating &amp; exploiting situational aspects (Create Advantage).</p>
<p>I’d like to know if your partner would rather enjoy:<br>
A). solving a riddle with collective OOC (out-of-character) player creativity, or<br>
B.) solving a riddle by rolling dice based on in-character PC skills?</p>
<p>If the answer is A), OSR, Dread or clever murder mystery plots could be fun.<br>
If the answer is B), systems like Gumshoe may provide a helpful framework.</p>

<p>I’m skeptical of how well OSR games are going to work if they take issue with PbtA mechanics, which are, if anything, more rigorous than many OSR games.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’d suggest going for some basic traditional game. Call of Cthulu or BRP or something.  Hard stats.  No real GM judgement except target numbers, and almost all of them are focused on “collaborative problem solving”</p>

              <p>Blades in the Dark or some other Forged in the Dark game could work well, as darren noted, and I second Pathfinder 2e if he likes D&amp;D 3.5 and 4. GURPS could also work, though that usually requires the GM to do some prep with trimming down the skill list and such. FFG’s Star Wars games (Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion, and Force and Destiny) could also be a good fit.</p>
<p>As for search terms, I’m not sure if I can recommend anything beyond “trad RPG” and that is only half-right at best.</p>

Presuming you want something (relatively) new. I’ll give a big suggestion for <a href="https://frialigan.se/en/games/symbaroum/">Symbaroum</a>! Crunchy in character creation and mechanics, but also very customizable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/">Blades in the Dark</a> might fit — it’s crunchy, but not necessarily in character creation (though there is a some of depth, imo). BitD is urban fantasy, tho, but there is <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/band-of-blades/">Band of Blades</a>, which is military fantasy (uses the same system). As for OSR, I’m not too familiar. From what I’ve seen, though, OSR seems as simplified as PbtA, tbh</p>
<p>ETA: Let me throw in <a href="http://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/category/products/13th-age/">13th Age</a> and <a href="https://greenronin.com/fantasyage/">Fantasy AGE</a>, those might scratch that crunchy itch!</p>
