**For the first 24 hours, folks who expressed an interest in the slack for playtesting this game will have priority sign-up please!**

Each one-shot game is scheduled for 4 hours. I will email everyone to confirm attendance. Sessions will be recorded through Zoom for reference, but only released for public consumption if all players consent.

*We were so close to home when the new orders came through. We&#39;re lightyears away from civilization and must intercept the Palantir, a ship declared missing years ago. It&#39;s in our best interests to get on board as quickly as possible, rescue any survivors, salvage whatever valuables we can, and return home.*

*I know we all want to get back to our lives and off the clock, so let&#39;s work together as a crew and get this done. We may have some new faces on board for this mission, so play nice and behave.*

*You may have heard disturbing reports about what happened on the Palantir, but I can assure you that none of that has been confirmed or validated by any authority.*

**THROUGH A MIRROR DARKLY is a sci-fi horror game built on the Belonging Outside Belonging system, and is being playtested.** You do not have to be familiar with BoB, the rules are simple and will be taught as we play. Some genre familiarity will help.

The game is inspired by films like **Event Horizon** , **Alien** , **Solaris** , and **Sunshine** . We will be making some choices in the beginning to decide what kind of horrors our characters will face, and several safety tools are built into the system. This is a GM-less game. If a player decides to have their character die, they pick a new playbook that represents the ship&#39;s growing evil and strength.

**CW: We will be using safety tools and stick to a PG-13 rating, but this IS a horror game.**

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
