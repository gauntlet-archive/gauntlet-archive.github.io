          <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been playing <a href="https://ndpdesign.com/annalise" rel="nofollow noopener">Annalise</a> by Nathan Paoletta on-and-off. This was my first try at the game. Since I‚Äôm only a couple of scenes into play, I‚Äôve only just begun to engage with the system. That being said, I am looking forward to get back into it.</p>
<p>I am playing by myself (solo). I consider myself experienced at it, though I‚Äôve only recently started to find ways to make it satisfying for myself.</p>
<p><strong>This is what has happened in the game so far:</strong></p>
<p>John Klein is an up and coming reporter. In the opening scene, his life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a violent, random mugging. Then, a year later, John finds out he has a brain tumor. After the diagnosis, he starts having weird experiences  that one part of him feels is real, but his rational self cannot accept. Are they hallucinations caused by the tumor?</p>
<p>For example, at a nondescript bar he thinks he overhears a man in a black suit say: ‚Äú‚Ä¶brain tumor. We didn‚Äôt know, but you are going to die no matter what‚Äù and other bizarre talk about his wife. Yet, when he asks the bartender if he heard, he assures him he‚Äôs never seen the guy and that John is just hearing chatter from the basketball game on TV.</p>
<p>I left the game at a point where there was a sort of hallucination involving a being with red eyes and giant wings on his back.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Annalise‚Äôs rules:</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve only been engaged with chargen and making Claims so far. Chargen was interesting. I really liked the potential of the Vulnerability and Secret I chose:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: I am vulnerable because I feel guilty about my wife‚Äôs death (Connie). (7c)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secret</strong>: Unbeknownst to him, John has a developing form of extra sensory perception. Its first manifestation was the feeling he got during the incident that ended up killing Connie. (3c)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have not really leaned enough into the Vulnerability as I develop John through play. I intend to correct that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôve also made a few Claims, and I do like the feeling of seeing a fictional element and thinking to myself, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôm going to f**k with this.‚Äù I‚Äôm figuratively rubbing my hands when I do that.  I do have some concerns with the use of Claims to interject fiction in a solo context insofar as I think overdoing it could deflate the experience for me by turning it into an exercise in daydreaming without any outside input. I also have some related concerns regarding the conflict mechanic (due to past experiences playing games like Remember Tomorrow and Our Last Best Hope by myself).</p>
<p>With other gmless games, I‚Äôve tended to play all the characters myself, or act as the antagonist for multiple characters. With Annalise, my intention is to just focus on John to see how that goes.</p>
<p>Since I mentioned solo play again,  I think this is a good point to mention that I am using a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique" rel="nofollow noopener">cut-up technique (link to Wikipedia)</a> to help me generate fiction. It helps me feel like I‚Äôm not  making up stuff by myself (something I don‚Äôt find satisfying in the context of solo rpgs).</p>
<p>I made my cutups from the movie script of The Mothman Prophecies movie circa 2002 (with Richard Geere as John Klein). It‚Äôs not a 100% random as you are making choices as you sift through these and pick or reject snippets. I try not to be too intentional in how I choose the cut ups. They just have to be coherent given the context.</p>
<p>I am also using a dice mechanic to answer yes or no questions about the fiction/world. If you imagine flipping a coin to answer yes/no questions about the world/fiction, you have the basic idea of what the dice mechanic does. I took the dice mechanic in Trollbabe almost wholesale, but changed Fight/Social/Magic to It/Me/You. There‚Äôs more to it, but that‚Äôs the basic core.</p>
<p>The combination of both would be what soloists might call an ‚Äòoracle‚Äô (aka ‚Äògame master emulator‚Äô), and this happens to be <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/319632/Tilt--An-oracle-for-solo-roleplaying" rel="nofollow noopener">the one I rolled one for my own use (link DTRPG)</a>. I rely much more on the cut up technique for that than I do on the dice mechanic for generating the content that I don‚Äôt generate when playing my character. (In another game of Remember Tomorrow, I use a similar cut up technique to generate output for the Player Characters while I take on the role of antagonist for each of them). The reason I enjoy it so much is because of all the surprising details that come out of all that fiction someone else wrote.</p>
<p>I think that covers at a high-level how the ‚Äúnot-me‚Äù content was generated.</p>
<p>When it comes the fiction more intentionally created by me, so far it‚Äôs just been me reacting as John Klein to what the cut up text presents me. I have not yet made use of Annalise‚Äôs rules to generate the fiction, but will eventually use my Claims and use the conflict mechanics.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm happy to discuss anything in the post that piques people‚Äôs interests. I can talk more at length about how IU think my solo approach differs from the more usual approaches, or whatever. I also have some thoughts about conflicts in general, as far as my solo games go (I find them tricky at times).</p>
<p>Hope this is useful and interesting.</p>

          <p>Hello, and thank you. This is both useful and interesting. To me, at least.</p>
<p>As much as the cut up technique is an honorable tradition (Dada lives !), did you try to incorporate AI generated material into your narration ? Have you tried the scenarios (‚Äúguided play‚Äù) for Annalise ?</p>
<p>How did you come to the Trollbabe dice mechanic (later seen in Shock:SF, and spread by Lasers &amp; feelings) ?</p>
<p>Claims are my dope, too. Can you please name some cool Claims you made ?</p>

          <p>Glad you found this worth your while. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I have tried AIDungeon separately, though not with an RPG system as of yet. I am aware of people that have done so, though. I recently checked out <a href="../../experiments-with-aidungeon/5466/10.html">a post</a> by <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/chiaroscuro">@Chiaroscuro</a> and someone posted a guide for playing ttrpgs with  AIDungeon which I transposed to my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/about/wiki/aidungeonwithttrpg" rel="nofollow noopener">reddit sub‚Äôs wiki</a>. At some point I will try it, but for now I have focused on the semi-analog experience (semi, because I still use a computer screen).</p>
<p><strong>Trollbabe‚Äôs dice mechanic:</strong></p>
<p>The first indie game I played was Shock:SF. The first time I actually got my hands on Trollbabe was through a Bundle of Holding, and that was the annotated version. I have been playing around with bastardized versions of its conflict mechanic ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Annalise:</strong></p>
<p>I have not actually tried the guided play scenarios. I‚Äôve had this Mothman/Annalise in mind for a while now, so I really need to get it out of my system. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I am also not sure yet if I‚Äôll play with the rules straight, or drift it. It feels familiar enough that I feel like making changes to suit my solitaire needs. In some ways, I already have by choosing to stick with only one protagonist.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here are the claims I‚Äôve made so far, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connie-- John‚Äôs deceased wife.</li>
<li>Gioblastoma Multiforma/Temporal lobe tumor.</li>
<li>‚ÄúWe rise out of the clouds‚Äù</li>
<li>electrical wires hum</li>
</ol>
<p>I already used <span class="hashtag">#2</span> during a short scene between John and a friend. With the help of cut ups, I had decided that John wanted to pick his friend‚Äôs brain regarding brain tumors and possible hallucinations. At the time, I wasn‚Äôt sure of the why he would ask this friend specifically given that he sought out the friend at an elementary school (was he familiar with the condition for some reason, for example). I left that open, and waited for the cut ups to say something (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/comments/jrm0yb/sgam_annalise_tilt_oracle_pt_2/" rel="nofollow noopener">quoted actual play</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, I could engage the Tilt oracle to ask a series of questions, but as I was playing a couple of cutups came to my attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>got really sick, Kevin. It was</em><br>
<em>was this?  HOLLY About two months.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sound like Kevin talking about a Holly who was sick. And of course, because I have this claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gioblastoma Multiforma/Temporal lobe tumor. (2C)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm going to use it to declare that she had the same type of tumor. So when Kevin talks about Holly‚Äôs sickness, it can be assumed that he‚Äôs referring to the tumor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What follows is the dialogue, with my own additions/edits in brackets <em>[]</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kevin: ‚Äú<strong>[</strong> When Holly <strong>]</strong> got really sick, <s>Kevin. I </s>  it <strong>[</strong> took <strong>]</strong> <s>was was this? HOLLY A</s> about two months <strong>[</strong> of tests to find out what was wrong <strong>]</strong>.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: ‚ÄúKevin, I‚Äôm sorry to ask. Did Holly experience any strange symptoms like hallucinations?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading back, the addition of ‚Äú<em>of tests to find out what was wrong</em>‚Äù seems a bit of a long addition; I usually try to intervene much less, but it must have felt OK at the time.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice in terms of claims?  Like, in your experience, what type of claims tend to be best?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>Thank you for showing some cut-up in action.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a tradition of narrative games dealing with demons, the Maker of Life and other ‚Äúinfluences‚Äù that I see as tentatives to establish player resources distinct from character resources. Claims are exactly it, a very original approach, and the first I learned about (first crush sort of thing).</p>
<p>I think the best ones are those that can play with or against character, the more versatile. But storytelling is like circus : some walk the tight rope, others juggle with anvils. You can make anything of anything.</p>
<p>A tumor is hard to bounce over from character to character, but has potential for deep investigation. The wires are more ductile, but they are mostly an ominous sign leading somewhere else, an <em>interim</em>.</p>
<p>I am only trying to expose the kind of criteria I apply to Claims, or player resources in general. Most of all it‚Äôs you playing : thank you for asking about my tastes.</p>
<p>My taste and interest at the moment goes toward player resources with a distinctive thematic vibe (father and son, do unto others, the higher they fall, etc.), the more abstract ones : relationships. I think if I can convey that, more lightweight will be easy.</p>

          <p>Your explanation seems like a good breakdown to me!</p>
<p>We‚Äôll see what happens with the tumor. It might work with just one character as the focus.</p>

          <p>I never payed Annalise, so I have never played any Claim. But I tweaked many games in order to use player resources.</p>
<p>In the first game I committed, Utopian Chronicles, players have all sort of traits, some direct properties of their characters, other more abstract, much like Claims. Player / character goals are ‚Äúorthogonal‚Äù to that of other player / characters, sometimes clashing, sometimes aligning. This leads me to think the setup of player / character goals matters. When properly set, any resource will do, the more abstract the easier to wield. In our longest anime high school scenario, we utilized every piece of the world, with such ‚ÄúClaims‚Äù as : X‚Äôs mother, school grades, the kendo club, playing on the console, changing gender identity on skin contact, revealing your astrological sign, sweets and soda.</p>
<p>Something else I have experience with is Keys. They come from Clinton R Nixon‚Äôs The Shadow of Yesterday, adapted into Solar System by Eero Tuovinen, then made famous by John Harper with Lady Blackbird. The idea is : a bit like a Fate Compel, which you can sell off when you act against them. It‚Äôs still very much PC centered. Traits with a negative connotation tend to play with / against character, too, regardless of how you setup your version of a Compel mechanic (player / GM trigger / choice, etc.) In the end, John Harper‚Äôs Devil‚Äôs bargain / Danger dice (derived from Vincent Baker‚Äôs Otherkind Dice) won my heart. All the mechanics in this last paragraph have in common a compatibility with NOT PvP, which means you can set the level of skullduggery at the table‚Äôs optimum. Playing at home with kids and grognards, that‚Äôs a condition of play for me. But if you have different conditions, say, a weekly group of random persons at the local MtG den, there are probably better options.</p>

          <p>I think it‚Äôs really cool that you‚Äôre playing Annalise solo! Neat!</p>
<p>The magic of Annalise is in the ‚Äúcallback‚Äù nature of the Claims to set the mood and make things creepy and the torture of the dice mechanic to force you to figure out what you really want.</p>
<p>Your report doesn‚Äôt mention if you engaged the conflict resolution / dice mechanic yet. Did you? I‚Äôm a little nervous about the effectiveness of you essentially putting yourself to the test. Are you using cutups to guide the escalation of stakes? How does that bit work for you?</p>

          <p>I have not engaged the conflict mechanics yet with Annalise. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> However, I‚Äôve played a small number of games with such mechanics, and I have found them tricky at times for the kind of experience I am aiming for in solo play.</p>
<p>With cut ups, what kind of end to the scene happens is only partially in my control, because cut ups are heavily randomized and I‚Äôm not looking for them to lead in a particular pre-destined direction, but only for them to make sense given what has already happened. An end to the scene will often suggest itself to me as part the process, since there will eventually occur a natural point where the scene has run its course (interesting footnote at the end of the post). The catch, however, is that there is no guarantee that this point will be one that suggests a conflict.</p>
<p>I can exert more intentionality during the process by consciously fishing for cut ups that might support some sort of conflict, but this can trigger my brain into pre-formulating a conflict. When that happens, then I find myself looking for cut-ups that support this conflict rather than just letting them suggest what they will suggest and surprise me. This dampens the fun aspect of playing a solo rpg for me because it feels too close to how I might engage in creative writing  (plotting ahead of time, etc). It‚Äôs not what I want out of a solo experience.</p>
<p>The only exception to this trend has been a game using <a href="https://magpiegames.com/product/our-last-best-hope-print-pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Our Last Best Hope</a>. I‚Äôve only played it once, and it‚Äôs been a while, so maybe my recollection is off. Still, I seem to recall that there wasn‚Äôt a lot of mechanical conflict between characters, but rather external threats. These were pre-defined as part of session prep, and then at the end of the scene, chosen randomly. So, a scene could end ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù as I interacted with the cut ups, and then it was time to roll for which threat came up.</p>
<p>It hasn‚Äôt all been failures, though. It‚Äôs just a bit tricky at times when I‚Äôm trying to lessen my influence over the course of the scene. I like to influence the direction of the scene but only through the role I‚Äôve chosen: either player or gm, but not both.</p>
<p>Maybe I‚Äôll find a more consistent solution the more I play.</p>
<p>*Note:  Just wanted to add this footnote linking to an interesting discussion on the Word Mill Games forum about how our brains appear to cut-off scenes: <a href="https://groups.io/g/wordmillgames/message/7706" rel="nofollow noopener">Scenes</a>. I think it is a good explanation of how my brain is working when it senses that a scene is coming to its end.</p>

          <p>Had a mini session of Annalise with my Mothman cut ups and Tilt.</p>
<p>;tldr; John is dreaming about his dead wife; some pleasant 4th of July scene from long ago.  He is rudely awakened by a state trooper who almost trumps him up on a DUI charge. John, who has a tumor, almost starts seizing from the stress, but he manages to get the trooper to leave him alone by complying with his commands.</p>
<p>Very short, but some enjoyable details for me. Learned something about the character. Etc, etc.</p>
<p>Figured maybe I‚Äôd post a bit of my raw session here using the same markdown I use to organize my thoughts, and material.</p>
<p>I guess some explanation of how I use the markdown is in order.</p>
<p>I mark out the cut ups under consideration like this:</p>
<p><code>This is a cut up snippet in a code block</code></p>
<p>Narration is always in block quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a piece of narration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A considerable part of the fiction comes directly from the cut ups, so often I am quoting them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a cut up snippet in a code block</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often need to strike out words from the snippets if they don‚Äôt make sense, so I use the strikethrough markdown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a cut up snippet <s>in a code block</s></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, I also need to add words of my own to the snippets so that an idea can be made more clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a cut up snippet [that I am quoting] <s>in a code block</s></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often start scenes with cut-ups. I randomize them and then curate based on how they hang together and what they can tell me about the set up of the scene. Then I get the narration out of that. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Third Session</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>player‚Äôs note:</strong> *It would just fit if we found that John had parked his car at the same spot where he had been with Connie ten years ago. I could just declare that ‚ÄúJohn decided to go to that same place‚Äù as a retcon, but that‚Äôs not satisfying to me. An oracle question feels more fun and fair.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tilt number: 10 (You - 45%, Me and It - 50%)</li>
<li>Is it (John‚Äôs current location) the same as the location of his memory? 50%</li>
</ul>
<p>Some facts would help those odds a bit. Some cut ups will help me imagine some possibilities.</p>
<p><code>farmhouse from the the woods across</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a farmhouse nearby? (It) 50%</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll(1d20)+0: 10</p>
<p>No, there is not a farmhouse nearby.</p>
<p>But wait, in John‚Äôs memory there was a ‚ÄúNO TRESPASSING‚Äù sign, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a ‚ÄúNO TRESSPASSING‚Äù sign?  50%</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll(1d20)+0: 10</p>
<p>No, there isn‚Äôt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it (John‚Äôs current location) the same as the location of his memory? 50%</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll(1d20)+0: 7</p>
<p>Another location it is:</p>
<p><code>speeding down the interstate.</code></p>
<blockquote>

<p><code>what‚Äôs happened to you, John? What</code></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><code>John sees them all step onto the</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><s>John sees them all</s> [TROOPER:] <s>step</s> Step [out] onto the [breakdown lane, sir.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the interest of full disclosure, I‚Äôve had these cut ups in view, letting them inspire some vague idea of where things could end up:</p>
<p><code>wounds.  Finally, one nods at him:</code><br>
<code>got the hell out of there. Next</code><br>
<code>in your car and the universe just</code></p>
<p>At least one of these gives a confrontational/angry vibe, which is how I feel about the request to step out of the car since John hasn‚Äôt been drinking (he‚Äôs my character, so that‚Äôs how it is). I‚Äôm thinking maybe this could become an opportunity to engage the conflict system.</p>
<p>Annalise has two ways of initiating a conflict: initiation by the active player (‚ÄúSeizing a Moment‚Äù) or initiation by the scene guide (‚ÄúPushing a Moment‚Äù). Cut ups don‚Äôt have any intentionality, so I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôll be Seizing a lot more moments than feeling like they‚Äôre being Pushed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am thinking I could Seize a Moment here. Making a Satellite Trait based on the Secret seems doable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Secret</strong>: Unbeknownst to him, John has a developing form of extra sensory perception. Its first manifestation was the feeling he got during the incident that ended up killing Connie. (3c)</li>
</ul>
<p>Something related to this ESP ability to unconsciously pick something up about this cop and spooking him (That would be my Achievement).</p>
<p>The Consequence could be something related to that confrontational feeling of the interaction so far. Pissing off the trooper in some way (something I would need make more concrete using cut ups). Or maybe the Consequence could be something else entirely if the Cut Ups say so.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm always eyeing cut ups, and I found two more that look interesting in this context:</p>
<p><code>this could be an electrical impulse</code><br>
<code>just inches in front of John‚Äôs face</code></p>
<p>I am thinking this could be a really pissed off cop (‚Äújust inches in front of John‚Äôs face‚Äù) with a taser (‚Äúelectrical impulse‚Äù). There are no mentions of tasers in this movie script, so I‚Äôm clearly being more interpretative than I usually like to be. Still, the context is too strong to ignore.</p>
<p>This could be a Consequence.</p>
<p>However‚Ä¶my Secret has very few coins (3) and creating a new Trait would lower it even more. Maybe I can lean on my Vulnerability instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerability: I am vulnerable because I feel guilty about my wife‚Äôs death (Connie). (7c)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe John‚Äôs guilt has started to make him unconsciously create problems for himself as a way of self punishment. The problem I‚Äôm having with this is that the Achievement would be getting punished, so the Consequence might have no teeth.</p>
<p>Maybe the guilt causes John to get depressed sometimes, and he just wants to be left the hell alone.</p>
<p>So, new Satellite Trait using 2 coins from Vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just leave me the hell alone (5)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, John just wants this trooper to leave him alone. He complies with every command to get him out of his hair as fast as possible.</p>
<p>However, I also just had an idea. Forget the taser. I have the Claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gioblastoma Multiforma/Temporal lobe tumor. (2C)</li>
</ul>
<p>Electrical impulse + tumor = seizure. That‚Äôs my Consequence. I just need to flesh the details out more with cut-ups.</p>
<p><code>just inches in front of John‚Äôs face</code><br>
<code>ticket. They bring the car. The</code><br>
<code>I‚Äôm not going to let the same thing</code><br>
<code>drive off.  EXT. STREET IN</code></p>
<p>It could go like this: the trooper gets his face close to John‚Äôs and tells John can‚Äôt drive off, and that he‚Äôll have his car towed. Obviously, the trooper is just being a dick.</p>
<p>The action and narration of it can be fleshed out more by looking for cut ups that fit the context, even with some help from a text search (‚Äúarrest‚Äù, ‚Äúsmell‚Äù):</p>
<p><code>smell his breath.  JOHN I guarantee</code><br>
<code>So I‚Äôm not under arrest?  CONNIE</code></p>
<p><code>just inches in front of John‚Äôs face</code><br>
<code>ticket. They bring the car. The</code><br>
<code>I‚Äôm not going to let the same thing</code><br>
<code>drive off.  EXT. STREET IN</code></p>
<p>In the end, I don‚Äôt really want to add to much of my own output, so I feel like this works reasonably:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The trooper stands] just inches in front of John‚Äôs face<br>
[as if to] smell his breath.  <s>JOHN I guarantee</s></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs clear from the context that the cop is just looking for an excuse to harass John.</p>
<p>So, this is the point where we (me) find out if John is left alone after being compliant, if the stress of the situation causes him to start seizing, or both.</p>
<p>Results of 2d6:</p>
<p>Roll(1d6)+0:4,+0</p>
<p>Roll(1d6)+0: 4,+0</p>
<p><strong>Achievements:</strong></p>
<p><code> Value of 4: You gain the Achievement.</code></p>
<p><strong>Consequences:</strong></p>
<p><code> Value of 4: You avoid the Consequence, though perhaps only barely. When the Moment closes, place a coin in your Reserves.</code></p>
<p><code>this could be an electrical impulse</code></p>
<p>Another cut-up:</p>
<p><code>eerie, dizzying, disorienting...</code></p>
<p>So, finally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[John complies with every command the trooper gives him, in the hopes he‚Äôll just leave him alone.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he gets his Achievement.</p>
<p>Another cut up:</p>
<p>So, all of these together to build a little flavor:</p>
<p><code>I‚Äôm not going to let the same thing</code><br>
<code>drive off.  EXT. STREET IN</code><br>
<code>ticket. They bring the car. The</code><br>
<code>in your car and the universe just</code><br>
<code>got the hell out of there. Next</code><br>
<code>John I‚Äôm sorry  for ruining</code><br>
<code>wounds.  Finally, one nods at him:</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Trooper:] I‚Äôm <s>not</s> going to let <s>the same thing</s><br>
[you] drive off <s>.  EXT. STREET IN</s><br>
[without a] ticket. <s>They bring the car. The</s><br>
[Go back] in your car and <s>the universe</s> just<br>

<s>wounds.</s>  Finally, [he] nods at him[ curtly.]<s>:</s><br>
<s>John</s> I‚Äôm sorry  for ruining [your day, sir.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice cut-up:</p>
<p><code>storm is brewing over West</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[For a moment, John feels like an internal]<br>
storm is brewing <s>over West</s> [inside of him; ]<br>
<s>this could be</s> an electrical impulse[‚Äì]<br>
eerie, dizzying, disorienting‚Ä¶`<br>
Then he drives off.</p>
