    <title>Need Players: Dungeon World: Beyond the Slave-Pit (1 of 3)</title>

    <description>Had to bow out of tonights game due to being sick. Super bummed so hoping someone can take my place.

What happens to the survivors of the Slave-Pit of Drazhu? Stay tuned to find out as we flesh out the survivor’s backstory and we play to find out what they do next!

This will be a DW series with only 4 players, each with a standard playbook.
