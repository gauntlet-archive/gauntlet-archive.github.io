    <description>Let&#39;s discuss &quot;misfortune&quot; and how a GM can dish it out in PbtA games. 
I&#39;d like to look beyond the obvious: hp loss, debilities, resource loss, and new threats.</description>

              <p>My favorite use of misfortune as a GM is “an NPC behaves differently than you expected they would” followed by “you left this up to chance and it didn’t go well.”</p>
<p>In Blades there are a lot of opportunities for this sort of complication in the form of other factions who might interfere, someone catching onto a loose end, inoportune callbacks, that sort of thing.</p>

Especially if the PCs mistake ends up causing serious problems for someone or something they care about, and they can clearly see that they are blame (rather than a random misfortune… although that can work sometimes too)</p>

<p>These days though, I like putting them into a very bad spot where they can’t really get out on their own. I like using this to both spotlight an area where I can show them the shortfalls of their own class, but also this lets me redirect the spotlight to someone else in the group who may not be getting a lot of love, or who I want to give a chance to bond with the other character but just haven’t found the right moment.</p>
