    <description>**Warning: This Event is available only to the members of Camp Pursuivant (facilitator camp).**

Reyes-Okoye, the largest pharmaceutical company in Neon City has developed a new biological weapon which might be a game-changer with the fragile and complex balance of corporate and criminal powers in the sprawl. The buyer is unkown, but we know that next sunday the weapon will be transported from the company headquarters to an undisclosed location. The shipment will be heavily guarded.

We also know that everyone important wants to get their hands on the cargo. Yourself included.
