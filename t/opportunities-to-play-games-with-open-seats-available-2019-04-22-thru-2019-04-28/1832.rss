    <description>Hey folks!

In this post, we will highlight games for the upcoming week which have open seats and therefore the opportunity to add some more gaming fun to your week.

### [ DW Mondays: The Sky Chain ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LaT3wMmOF2_CoURpZjM)

[date=2019-04-22 time=19:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-22 time=22:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
Islands floating in the sky? How strange, is it natural? Is it magical? Why are there giant chains anchoring these floating islands to the ground?  Would they just float away if the chain was broken? Has anyone ever made it to the highest island? The stories say the islands have been up there longer than anyone alive can remember, even the elves, but there are tales that say the islands weren&#39;t always up there. Perhaps those of you who are brave enough should climb up the chain. 

### [Get Ready 2 Rock (Playtest)](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LZmSWFnI7161VdR5_Mj)

[date=2019-04-22 time=20:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-22 time=23:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
Your band has a big gig coming up, and you&#39;ll need to keep your rockstar antics in check if you want to keep getting more shows. But on the other hand, what&#39;s the point of being in a band if you can&#39;t live on the wild side? Make a date with stardom in this GM-less, Powered by the Apocalypse game of musical mayhem.

### [ Never Tell Me the Odds: Ol&#39; Hallelujah ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-La60mv_y7AGX957DNlZ)

[date=2019-04-22 time=20:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-22 time=23:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
YOU ARE A SPACEFARING SCOUNDREL. You’ve blasted, cheated, swindled, double-crossed, charmed, and hyper- jumped your way across HALF THE GALAXY. But now, you’ve made a few bad decisions and gotten into some REAL TROUBLE. The one thing in all the universe that you really care about is in terrible danger, and keeping it safe might require the ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. Are you desperate enough to risk everything you have to SAVE WHAT MATTERS MOST?

### [ Lacuna Part 1: The Creation of the Mystery and The Girl from Blue City ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LXpygfmqDNbsirixKau)

[date=2019-04-23 time=19:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-23 time=22:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
Is it a dream? Is it a nightmare? Or is it just a game? And are you already playing? Lacuna Part 1. The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City is an experimental roleplaying game . . . and you’re part of the experiment whether you realize it or not.

[date=2019-04-25 time=14:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-25 time=17:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
A high-fantasy take on mecha warfare, play as rebellious magicians, fighters, clerics, and forty-foot tall magical constructs called Astirs, caught up in the struggle against an Authority that seeks to control them.

[date=2019-04-25 time=20:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]  
When Freedom is threatened, when Liberty is under siege, when the forces of evil are knocking on your door, that’s when the GRUNTS (General Reserve United Nations Tactical Squad) mobilize! A Gauntlet Comics presentation! We’ll use @Michael_G_Barford’s Storm Riders to recreate the adventures of Solomon Toys’ massively popular 80s military action figures and the associated mega-hit afternoon cartoon (Look to GI Joe, MASK, and Green Plastic Army Men for inspiration).

### [ Gauntlet Games Now ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LZfCSPa_kn3riE0hb_4)

[date=2019-04-28 time=17:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]  
Gauntlet Games Now is a our ‘on demand’ gaming event. There are multiple slots. Since we are setting it up to be “on demand”. Game groups will be created based on who shows up to each slot. We’ll be using the registration system to get an idea of how many facilitators we’ll need for each slot. So please sign up and get on the waitlist. I will be looking at the waitlist and trying to recruit more game facilitators if there is enough demand.</description>
