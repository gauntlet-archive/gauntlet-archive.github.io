    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/05/30/crowdfunding-collection-170/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #170, including every tabletop rpg project started between 05/23 and 05/30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This week the there are a nice, interesting projects, to which I’ll get to now, without much ado.

I’ll stat with &lt;b&gt;this world is not yours: an RPG zine&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a small, as the title says zine-sized, game for one to two players. It explores the topic of generations, changes and what one leaves behind. The narrative system is inspired by games like Microscope. I do consider the topic quite interesting, and hence recommend that you have a look. Fans of the cyberpunk genre should have a look at &lt;b&gt;UNDER NEON&lt;/b&gt;. The game offers quite an interesting system for character generation, where everyone starts out the same. Along with a more traditional d20 system. I do consider the idea quite interesting, and the project looks nice.
Among the (urban) fantasy games &lt;b&gt;Exalted: Essence&lt;/b&gt; by Onyx Path Publishing is a project worth considering, imho. The game offers a streamlined version of the 3rd edition, and basically combines and condenses quite some sourcebooks into 250+ pages. Have I had more money, were the shipping not as expensive, and the delivery in 2023, I’d be totally in. As is, I will wait for the book to hit my FLGS. If you are looking for some lighthearted urban fantasy, &lt;b&gt;Fae’s Anatomy&lt;/b&gt; should have you covered. The game about melodramatic medical mysteries is about treating fantasy creatures with rather bizarre ailments. The system utilizes narrative focused rules inspired by Fiasco and Hillfolks, and the game is clearly inspired by series E.R., Greys Anatomy and more. I think it’s a quite cool project, worth considering. If you yearn for post-apocalyptic urban fantasy &lt;b&gt;Graywalkers Purgatory&lt;/b&gt; has you covered. You will battle the supernatural creatures and horrors with guns, magic, katanas, bones and stuff. The project offers a quickstart, to get a look at the system and setting, and you may choose from two systems. One D&amp;D 5E inspired, and one called Weavemaster (3d10 based). It does look nice.
If you like gamebooks, &lt;b&gt;The Isle of Torment&lt;/b&gt; offers quite a massive experience. There are more than 2000 descision and the char sheet looks cool. If you like swashbuckling fantasy, take a look.
There are of course more projects. Like the &lt;b&gt;Knock! Issue Two&lt;/b&gt; compendium, with a ton of stuff for OSR gamers, or &lt;b&gt;FISK BORG&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Galgenbeck After Dark&lt;/b&gt; which got MÖRK BORG fans covered. I do like the &lt;b&gt;White Whale in Dice&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;Dice Sculptor: Custom Designed Dice&lt;/b&gt; appears to me as an interesting thing.
You’ll find those projects, and more, in this collection:
