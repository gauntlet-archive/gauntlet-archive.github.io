    <description>I&#39;m reading through the larp design book that came out of the most recent Knutepunkt conference (*Larp Design: Creating Role-Play Experiences*) and right away Johanna Koljonen comes out and says 

EVERYTHING IS A DESIGNABLE SURFACE

...and it is a very challenging and liberating idea. As game designers we&#39;re building experience frameworks, and we are not limited to the traditional bits and bobs in service of that goal. In my own work I often think about ways to challenge accepted practice (&quot;What if you made everyone sit in silence for an uncomfortably long time?&quot;) but Koljonen is urging us to take the opposite approach, to look at every piece of interaction as something that we should consciously choose - or choose not to - design. I think this way of thinking is more prevalent in larp due to the wide-open affordances of the form, but it is equally relevant to tabletop design. 

It makes me wonder what designable surfaces we routinely overlook. The category is vast. Few games, for example, care about player seating arrangement, but on the social level it is a huge variable that will impact play. The way you learn a game - the way you learn *about* a game - is designable. 

Let&#39;s talk about interesting designable surfaces.</description>

<p>One game that isolates participants is Beastfucker by Julian Hyde and Wendy Gorman. I think it helps evoke a feeling in discomfort in both groups, the chanters and the isolated player. All creative power is in the hands of the isolated player at this moment, while the others are setting tone.</p>

I’ve recently wrote a simple narrative game and decided to put a short list of suggested things you could use to help speed up the game but I also stated that you could do with just pen and paper, as the game itself is designed to be played with just that.</p>

              <p>Maybe this slogan could be used to make interesting design exercises? First, define a designable surface and then try to design a functional roleplaying game using only that surface.</p>
<p>For example, sound, noise and music is a thing you can design for a game. But can you design a game exclusively using that surface?</p>
<p>Or food?</p>
<p>Personally I can’t immediately think of a way but experience shows that in game design, when something seems impossible someone is going to do it <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It’s kind of a applying the same ideas re: designable surfaces to music. “All players play from the same group of 53 sequences […] each performer having the freedom to<br>
determine how many times he or she will repeat each pattern before moving on”</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qzmi7Wm10Y0" rel="nofollow noopener">You can listen to an example in practice here.</a> It starts off a little slowly, but the end result is quite interesting. It made me think about the role of music in gaming, and how cool it would be to have a game where making sound is central to play.</p>

Including food is one of those things where you’re forcing a LARP onto the template of a tabletop game and would require an entire separate safety discussion. Having dietary restrictions is socially isolating enough already without someone bringing that into my gaming.</p>

              <p>Since my passion is laog - live action online game - design, the design surfaces I have to think about right now have to do with the typical or not so typical setup of online games, i.e. when people each sit in their own room at a computer with webcam and mic, browser tabs open etc.</p>
<p>We have</p>
<p>the group chat (as it used in Monsterhearts games on the Gauntlet to simulate short messaging)</p>
<p>We have potentially asymmetric visibility through webcams when people put their cameras and off (which can be used for black box like situations as in my game The Election of the Wine Queen)</p>
<p>We have the audio (today I playtested my next game in which half the players can hear, the others I only talk)</p>
<p>We have the world wide web (as I use Google Street maps in my game Tuk Fast Tuk Furious).</p>
<p>We have the invisible lower part of our bodies.</p>
<p>We have the privacy of our private room while playing with total strangers.</p>
<p>We have the recording of the session, the publication: We have reaction videos (as I made one with A N N A for a Murderous Ghosts session). We have retroactive changes of the story by manipulating the recording.</p>
<p>There are dozens of more elements which scream to be used in design, I’m sure.</p>

<p>Two examples of isolation that work pretty well:</p>
<p>The hot seat in <em>Microscope</em>, where everyone but the person in the hot seat is required to STFU.</p>
<p>The selection of the summit team in <em>The Climb</em>, where the play group is split into two cohorts, who communicate by radio and from that point on have different roles and responsibilities. Occasionally those cohorts split further, leaving one person all alone for a while, and that is <em>fantastic.</em></p>
