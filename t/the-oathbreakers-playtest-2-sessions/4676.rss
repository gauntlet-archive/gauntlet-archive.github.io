***We are Oathbreakers: the arcane community has forsaken us for our sins. But we were framed by the Conspiracy, a sinister group of mages who are bending the world of magic and its people to their will.***

***We must break the laws of magic in order to save it. We must break the Conspiracy before it breaks us.***

**NOTE: Please only sign up if you&#39;re interested in playtesting!**

I would prefer if participants could attend both sessions, if that&#39;s possible. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Our first session will focus on character/setting creation, with some initial roleplay. Our second session will focus on on roleplay and reaching a conclusion for our short story.

This session is scheduled for 3 hours. I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance. Sessions will be recorded through Streamyard for reference, but only released for public consumption if all players consent.

Oathbreakers is a *Belonging Outside Belonging* game, inspired by the mechanics of Sam Zimmerman&#39;s *L’Oracle de la Révolution* . Use tarot cards to rewrite your destiny and destroy the conspiracy! The game rules are simple and will be taught during play.

**Touchstones:** Urban Fantasy novels, Elsewhere by Neil Gaiman, Vertigo comics from the 90s, a veeeeeeeeery light dash of Mage: The Awakening.

**Content Warning** : One of the playbooks focuses on death, most of the playbooks have options to outline the tragedy caused by the Conspiracy. There are also playbook moves that encourage romantic tension.

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

**Session 1:** [date=2020-03-15 time=09:00:00 timezone=&quot;Asia/Singapore&quot;] https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M0vLj5MpP1omLt99iks
