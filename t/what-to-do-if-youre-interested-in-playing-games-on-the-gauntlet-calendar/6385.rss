    <description>If you&#39;re interested in playing games on the Gauntlet Calendar, first read this post, to get a sense of what the calendar is and how it works: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/playing-online-with-the-gauntlet.html 

Once you&#39;ve read that, and you&#39;re still having trouble getting into games, feel free to post here in this thread to let us know you&#39;d like to play, but you haven&#39;t been able to get into games, as well as what timezones/timeframes work for you. Also feel free to suggest specific games you&#39;d like to see on the calendar.  Though we make no promises, Gauntlet game facilitators often reserve space in their games for new players, and we will be checking this space. If things match up, somebody may reach out to you with a slot in a game.  I&#39;ve also included our session guidelines below, so you can see at a glance our approach to safety.  Hope to see you in a Gauntlet game soon!

**Session Guidelines**
All Gauntlet sessions use safety tools. We expect GMs to present and explain the tools they will be using—as well as checking in to confirm them after session one. Most sessions use several tools in combination, most commonly Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and a CATS set up. Additionally all games are to follow the ***[Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)*** .

All our sessions are ***[Open Table](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-open-table-what-the-what)*** , meaning anyone can sign up as their schedule permits. This means games may have a slightly different line up of players from session to session. The GM will explain and teach any necessary rules. You don’t have to know the system or own the books to play. Sessions are Open Door as well—so if you try out a game and it isn’t a good fit, you can drop. We only ask that you alert the game facilitator and cancel your RSVP.

Most sessions run about three hours—that will be listed in the event description. GMs will offer one or two breaks and players can call for them as necessary. ***[If you have issues with safety or conduct at your table](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/play-issues-and-contact.html)*** , you can contact the Gauntlet Care Committee at [gauntletcommunity@gmail.com](mailto:gauntletcommunity@gmail.com).</description>

              <p>thanks for the replay.<br>
I really want to explore different playstyle, different people, different games.<br>
there is a lot of “chatting” in Italy on how and what are “american” or in general foreign kind of play and I’m really curious about it, but my primary objective is simply to play something new with different person that maybe, or maybe not, have different prospective.<br>
also, the idea of playing a charater that is foreign is really a good idea, I haven’t thought about and now will be, if the game leave me the opportunity, to play it, thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi, I think it’s a good idea to say your aprehension before the game, but really the people are going to be cool about a strange accent or taking time to find your words and all.<br>
I am in the same situation as you, and I remember a game on The Gauntlet where I missed an important spatial cue (like, there was a wall <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=9" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:">) and we just played a bit through and a bit around this issue, and all went well after that.<br>
I find the problem is more of my own expectations. Everyone’s at a disadvantage speaking a second language (Spoon, in Chicago at night, on Girls can tell, 2001). So, maybe you’ll just not play a diplomat, but rather a foreigner or something. Because the nuances that allow you to play a certain way in your mother tongues won’t be there to support you. I think it can be useful to explicitely name all the things that will change playing in a foreign tongue, so as to be aware of it. (maybe that could be an accessibility thread and, later, resource…)<br>
All in all, I believe getting to practice new playstyles is worth the effort, but yeah, it’s not total chill zone to play in a foreign tongue. As is playing via internet, as is playing at a convention, or trying anything for the first time.<br>

              <p>Good…something.<br>
Just a quick question.</p>
<p>I was lurking the calendar and I found a lot of interesting game/session.</p>
<p>I <strong>really</strong> want to play a lot, some, at least one but, I feel really insecure about my english.</p>
<p>Maybe some facilitators or some group doesn’t want a player that can have difficulties on understanding english and for me this is totally ok, I mean, I can slow the session and interrupt some narration asking for clarification or searching in a translator meaning of some terms.<br>
Can I, in some ways, clarify my problem when I subscribe to a session?</p>

              <p>Welcome <a class="mention" href="/u/gareththegeek">@gareththegeek</a> … Games are posted on the calendar 1-2 months ahead and fill up quickly. GMs usually start posting in the first few days of any month so that’s a good time to be monitoring the calendar or spotting sessions as they are posted on the Calendar channel here.<br>
That said, Patreon supporters have a priority grace period so GCOG is the ideal gateway as Gauntleteers have no priority and are actually asked to delay RSVP-ing to sessions until non-Gauntleteers have had a crack at them.</p>

              <p>Indeed, I recommend this as the way for getting into The Gauntlet. This is how I started!</p>
<p>One can get in as a GM/Facilitator by playing a few times OR by signing up for a Facilitator Training Camp. There will be more camps offered soon, I’m sure. This is how I got in!</p>
<p>I have very limited time slots when I could play but GMing gives me the flexibility to offer games when I can.</p>
<p>I second the recommendation to join GCOG. Do join my Pasión game, it’d be a pleasure to play with you.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m really interested in playing story games, gmless games, improvisational games and I heard the Gauntlet was a good community for that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot seem to find a single session in the entire calendar with an open slot and the community does not allow facilitating games without first playing in a few sessions so it seems like it’s impossible to get started on here.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
