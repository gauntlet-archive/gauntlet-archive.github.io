          <p>Inspired by the <a href="../quantum-orges-vs-read-a-sitch/1101.html">Quantum Ogres vs. Read a Sitch?</a> side discussion, I am curious how you play your personal version of <em>Dungeon World</em>?</p>
<p>One of the neatest things about DW is how not only it emulates <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> as a genre but also how it has done so as a product: everyone I know that plays it for any length of time drifts it strongly into a personal direction.<br>
I think this is a different quality than other PbtA games have, that even when put into different contexts still aim to draw on what makes the core game unique.</p>
<p>And I think it‚Äôs a great quality of the game and a way to get a fantasy game that explores the stuff I enjoy about fantasy.</p>
<p>My own DW kit basically looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Class Warfare</em> by Johnstone Metzger</li>
<li>My own customization of Jason Cordova‚Äôs <strong>Labyrinth</strong> move (from <em>Discern Realities Annual</em>)</li>
<li>The Heritage move for PCs from <em>Planarch Codex: Dark Heart of the Dreamer</em> by J. Walton</li>
<li>The ‚ÄúDraw the Map‚Äù technique and journey moves from <em>The Perilous Wilds</em> by Jason Lutes and Jeremy Strandberg</li>
</ul>
<p>And then I‚Äôve added my own alterations:</p>
<ul>
<li>gone are race moves and alignment; the <strong>Heritage</strong> move from Dark Heart replaces this and it is much more interesting to me; it uses the player characters as a unique lenses of the cultures they come from.</li>
<li>I still use Bonds but treat them almost more like <em>Burning Wheel</em> Beliefs for relationships that are evolved in small steps (most of the time)</li>
</ul>
<p>And my own additions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Escaping the Horde</strong>, a peripheral move about managing overwhelming odds</li>
<li>
<strong>Sway Hearts &amp; Mind</strong>, a new basic move to allow players to mechanically engage Threats by means other than violence (structurally it mirrors Defy Danger with different approaches)</li>
<li>
<strong>Smooch &amp; Smash</strong>, a peripheral move about exactly what you think</li>
</ul>
<p>So that‚Äôs basically <em>Mathias World</em>‚Ä¶ but what additions and alterations do you use as go-to‚Äôs? I‚Äôd be curious to know (and maybe lift for my own kit).</p>

          <p>I use the Core book and any DW stuff from Codex (especially the DR Annual, worth its weight in gold pressed latinum).</p>
<p>However in the past my players have shown little interest in ‚Äòco-developing‚Äô the setting, so I just run games in Greyhawk or my homebrew setting of Rikirta. There is little conversion work other than deciding which Deity/Divine Guidances aspects fit with the deity list.</p>
<p>Yes I use Alignment, but as a guide.<br>
Yes I use Bonds. If the Bond has a meaningful change then update it. ‚ÄòX smells like prey‚Äô becomes ‚ÄòX has potential to join the pack‚Äô becomes ‚ÄòI will aid X vs our rivals‚Äô etc.</p>
<p>Though I use premade settings, there is still plenty of room for ‚ÄòPlayer 1 tell me what is unusual about this inn/fountain/merchant and Player 2 tell me what happened last time you were here?‚Äô</p>
<p>I allow any race move to be used with any class. It‚Äôs a game. Refer to race as species as much as possible.</p>

          <p>My ongoing campaign is using the playtest rules for Freebooters on the Frontier 2E, so starting with those differences: random character generation, a lot more involved shared world building, a lot more OSR-isms and ‚Äúemergent‚Äù play, much squishier PCs and more dangerous monsters, higher chance of character death (no Last Breath move, which I kinda miss sometimes), ability damage, luck ‚Ä¶ other things but I can‚Äôt list 'em all and that I think covers the big stuff. Bonds work differently, and so do heritage moves, as does travel (since the game emphasizes traveling more). More robust rules for Followers (hirelings).</p>
<p>On top of those, I have a few of my own house rules. We‚Äôve switched back to DW‚Äôs method of healing over night (regain half your max XP rather than gaining 1+CON [minimum of 1]) because one of my players wasn‚Äôt having fun because she had a -2 CON and thus only ever got 1 HP back at a time. We‚Äôre trying that out to see how folks feel about it, and will switch back if it feels OP. I have a feeling it‚Äôll be fine though. I‚Äôve also added the Discern Realities questions back into Perceive, which didn‚Äôt have any set questions, and basically using <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jeremy_strandberg">@Jeremy_Strandberg</a>‚Äôs version of it, where <a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/09/discern-realities-make-question-part-of.html" rel="nofollow noopener">the questions are part of the trigger</a> (which I think is so much better). We‚Äôve also added Defend back in, because we weren‚Äôt sure why it was taken out, but have found no one really triggers it very often.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also been working on hacking in a heritage system like what <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/mathias">@Mathias</a> is talking about, but we haven‚Äôt quite got there yet. (On that note, the new <a href="https://lampblack-and-brimstone.com/2019/02/freebooters-on-the-frontier-2e-playtest-update/" rel="nofollow noopener">culture generation rules for Freebooters</a> I think are going to make this a lot of fun, generating heritage moves).</p>
<p>We also have a lot of player disagreement in our group, so I hacked Negotiate (Parlay) to contain a PvP element, based on Apocalypse World and MOTW:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Negotiate or Manipulate</h2>
<p>When you want something from someone that they don‚Äôt want to give up, make your case and roll‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚Ä¶+STR to intimidate them</p>
<p>‚Ä¶ +CHA to convince, charm or manipulate them</p>
<p>For NPCs: on a 10+, they name their absolute minimum price; on a 7-9, they name a price they could live with; on a 6-, mark the ability used, and prepare to be milked for all you‚Äôre worth.</p>
<p>For PCs: on a 10+, both; on a 7-9, choose 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they do it, they mark XP and take +1 forward</li>
<li>If they refuse, they must erase any bonds they have with you and reveal how they could be convinced (if they can be; they might not)</li>
</ul>
<p>On a 6-, mark the ability used, and they decide how badly you offended them and choose 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they refuse to do it, they mark XP</li>
<li>They‚Äôll do it, but they‚Äôre going to hold it against you; erase any bonds you have with the PC</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that‚Äôs pretty much everything?  There‚Äôs some stuff from Codex and the Discern Realities Annual that I‚Äôll use, but that‚Äôs sort of more on a case-by-case basis; I can‚Äôt think of anything that fundamentally changes how my table plays vs one running stock DW.</p>

          <p>Those intra-party mechanics are super interesting. I‚Äôve been holding it that between PCs things need to be resolved mostly via rp for DW. I do enjoy PbtA PC conflicts in other game a lot, though.<br>
The fact that they have to rebuild their social bonds when they mess up their relationship with each other is very intriguing!</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt know about that take on Discern Realities‚Ä¶ yeah, that seems like a super useful way of approaching it. Feels like something to offer a group that feels more comfortable with it all, though? But I like it.</p>
<p>Re: Heritage move: That‚Äôs a huge topic, I want it because big parts of fantasy as a genre is about interrogating different cultures and world views‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm super open with them as a vector for player input and for exploring that aspect in particular.<br>
But what I generally like about it: they don‚Äôt generalize something about a whole people, they say this is an aspect of these people‚Äôs culture that manifests in this individual in this one particular way.</p>
<p>And yeah, technique-wise I‚Äôve certainly taken a lot in from Discern Realities; the use of painting the scene and polling the table is a regular one. I suspect there are more habits and good practices picked up through osmosis of listening to it! &lt;3</p>

<p>Those intra-party mechanics are super interesting. I‚Äôve been holding it that between PCs things need to be resolved mostly via rp for DW. I do enjoy PbtA PC conflicts in other game a lot, though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thanks! Part of it is my own stuff, that I get kind of activated by in-character arguing that goes on for too long (this is, of course, ill-defined) so this was a way to be able to step in as GM/Judge and say ‚Äúalright, I think at this point we‚Äôre not really getting anywhere; Lady Goldbludgeon, is there any way at all that Terib might be able to convince you? Yeah, alright, let‚Äôs roll Negotiate then and see what happens.‚Äù (As a player in a D&amp;D campaign I once got into an in-character argument with another PC about whether we should steal a boat or not, and the player‚Äìwho‚Äôs a bit obstinate herself‚Äìwas playing a Lawful Awful Paladin who was beyond stubborn, and the whole thing‚Äìwhich went on for like a half hour of us going back-and-forth and none of the other players or DM stepping in‚Äìleft me feeling overwhelmed and out of spoons; that‚Äôs when I started thinking about the usefulness of something like this. It actually doesn‚Äôt come up a ton, but we‚Äôve been happy to have it.</p>

<p>The fact that they have to rebuild their social bonds when they mess up their relationship with each other is very intriguing!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This has a bit more to do with how bonds work in Freebooters 2E vs DW, where they don‚Äôt exist automatically but are built through character interactions (using a move called Keep Company) because there are different assumptions about whether party members know each other and how. Additionally, bonds aren‚Äôt resolved in Freebooters, they‚Äôre more to guide roleplaying and give a mechanical benefit that can be used with Help or Hinder. Bonds can be a little more tenuous given the nature of the PC relationships, so I thought erasing bonds could be an interesting way to represent the consequences of the conflict. The mechanical consequence is that you can‚Äôt add bonds to Help or Hinder rolls.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know about that take on Discern Realities‚Ä¶ yeah, that seems like a super useful way of approaching it. Feels like something to offer a group that feels more comfortable with it all, though? But I like it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I see what you mean about it feeling like you need a group that feels more comfortable, but tbh 3/4ths of my group are PBTA newcomers and latched on to it pretty easily. I‚Äôd be interested in hearing whether <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jeremy_strandberg">@Jeremy_Strandberg</a> has any additional thoughts on that point, since he‚Äôs the one that came up with it.</p>
<p>What I like most about it is that it drives home what Discern Realities/Perceive is about ‚Ä¶ gaining insight into the bigger picture. Perceive as written in Freebooters tends to default to basically being a Perception check from D&amp;D, which is kinda boring, you know? I don‚Äôt think players should have to roll to find treasure when they loot a monster‚Äôs corpse or whatever, that just seems unnecessary (in D&amp;D as well, but definitely in DW where it feels like it goes against the fundamental philosophies that underpin the game).</p>
<p>I‚Äôd love to talk more about heritage moves sometime. I don‚Äôt know if this is necessarily the place for it, but I like what you have to say about how they work for you and I‚Äôd love to hear more about how they work in play (and maybe some examples of some of the moves you and your players have come up with?)</p>

          <p>Here‚Äôs how I run my ongoing DW campaign‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I think advancement is a little too rapid. Leveling requires 10+current level in XP.</p>
<p>Characters don‚Äôt have an alignment. Instead, they have a player-defined <strong>Drive</strong>. This is roughly equivalent to a character‚Äôs ‚ÄúHigh Concept‚Äù Aspect from Fate. At the end of a session, if the character has made at least one significant action based on their Drive, mark XP.</p>
<p>I have removed all race moves from the game. Instead, every character defines a <strong>Trouble</strong> (again, stolen from Fate). I am experimenting with the following Basic Move, and the jury is still out‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Embrace Your Trouble</strong><br>
When you <strong>let your Trouble get the better of you</strong> roll +your lowest stat. On a 10+, tell the GM how your Trouble just made life more complicated, and hold 3. On a 7-9, the GM tells you how your Trouble just made life more complicated, and hold 1. Spend 1 hold to gain a +1 Forward on your next move.</p>
<p>In addition to Bonds, which are related to other PCs, I have also added character Goals, which are related to the Fiction. Once per scene, a character may take a +1 Forward when directly acting in pursuit of a Goal. Wheh a Goal is resoved, mark XP.</p>
<p>I use <em>The Perilous Wilds</em> for overland travel.</p>
<p>I have also made my own version of the Labyrinth move to abstract dungeon delving in general‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Explore the Dungeon</strong><br>
When you <strong>explore a dungeon without a map,</strong> roll +WIS.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, gain 1 hold, OR gain 2 hold and expose yourself to the dangers of the dungeon.</li>
<li>On a 7-9, gain 1 hold, and expose yourself to the dangers of the dungeon.</li>
<li>On a 6-, you stumble into danger without warning: The GM will tell you what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you gain hold through this move, it goes into a pool that can be shared among the party. Making this move multiple times can add additional hold to the pool.</p>
<p>At any time, spend 1 hold to return to the entrance of the dungeon or to the last place you rested in the dungeon (whichever is applicable in the fiction.<br>
At any time, spend 1 hold to <strong>Make a Disovery in the Dungeon</strong>.<br>
At any time, spend 5 hold to reach the end of the dungeon (i.e. the item you seek, a passage through, the Boss, etc.) Keep in mind that the end may be guarded by a Final Obstacle.</p>
<p><strong>Make a Discovery in the Dungeon</strong><br>
When you <strong>discover something in the dungeon</strong>, roll +WIS.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, pick two from the Dungeon Discoveries list.</li>
<li>On a 7-9, pick one from the Dungeon Disoveries list.</li>
<li>On miss, something discovers you: The GM will tell you what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dungeon Discoveries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You find an easily-defensible location suitable for resting.</li>
<li>You find a friendly creature or a site of wonder.</li>
<li>You find useful information.</li>
<li>You find a useful tool or weapon.</li>
<li>You find treasure or supplies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite writing the ‚Äú<a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/09/discern-realities-make-question-part-of.html" rel="nofollow noopener">make the question part of the trigger</a>‚Äù hack of Discern Realities, I haven‚Äôt really implemented it. I‚Äôve used in informally, but didn‚Äôt really find that it changed the game much for us. It actually was a little jarring for the experienced DW players. But then, I‚Äôm super comfortable with the move and watching for when it would/wouldn‚Äôt be a good use.</p>
<p>The other reason I haven‚Äôt deployed it widely is that I screws up playbooks with moves like ‚ÄúWhen you Discern Realities, you can always ask ‚Äò<em>What here is a perversion of nature</em>‚Äô for free.‚Äù  I‚Äôm a big fan of those types of move, and haven‚Äôt come up with a satisfactory way to adapt those moves (which I use widely in by Homebrew World and Stonetop playbooks) to work with the ‚Äúask first‚Äù model.</p>

          <p>As for ‚Äúhow do you play DW‚Ä¶‚Äù If I‚Äôm running it, I use my own <a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/homebrew-world.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Homebrew World</a>.  It‚Äôs streamlined for short arcs (one-shots or 3-4 sessions), rather than long-term play.</p>
<p>The big differences from core DW:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most  <strong>+1/-1 modifiers are replaced with advantage/disadvantage</strong>  (roll an extra die, discard the lowest/highest).</li>
<li>
<strong>Parley is completely different</strong> ; it‚Äôs as much an info-gathering move as it is a ‚Äúconvince them‚Äù move. Also: works on PCs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aid and Interfere are rewritten</strong>  as well. Aid is now ‚Äúgrant advantage but with risk‚Äù and Interfere is its own thing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Expendable gear (rations, ammo, bandages, gear, etc.) is condensed into ‚ÄúSupplies.‚Äù</strong>  Load is replaced with a series of gear slots. Make Camp, Volley, and other moves interact with the Supplies instead of rations &amp; ammo.</li>
<li>Most ‚ÄúSpecial‚Äù moves are gone.  <strong>Undertake a Perilous Journey is replaced with Venture Forth</strong> . I‚Äôve included a couple of my favorite custom moves for speeding up play.</li>
<li>There are  <strong>only 3 debilities</strong> , and  <strong>each affects two stats</strong> . But they‚Äôre easier to clear.</li>
<li>
<strong>XP and leveling are different</strong> , because this is meant for one-shots or short-term play. You get XP on a miss or when you Make Camp (instead of at end of session). An advance costs only 5 XP. You can burn XP to give yourself a +1 on a roll you just made.</li>
<li>No more ‚Äúbig number‚Äù on stats, just the modifier. Likewise, HP is now a set number per class.</li>
<li>‚ÄúRace‚Äù is just part of your look. But everyone has a  <strong>choice of Backgrounds</strong> , which replace the ‚Äúrace‚Äù moves and that give you a series of bond-like questions to use during intros.</li>
<li>
<strong>Drives instead of Alignments</strong> ; same mechanic but less baggage.</li>
<li>Many changes (some small, some big) within the classes themselves.</li>

          <p>99% of my games are run using <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/242339/One-Shot-World-Beta" rel="nofollow noopener">One Shot World</a>, which is basically Dungeon World minus long-form mechanics. That means no 3-18 Ability Scores, Load, Coin, etc. It also replaces Alignment with Drives, and railroads the character generation a bit (though it augments them at the same time). It does however push the GM and players to create the world either the ‚ÄúPerilous Wilds‚Äù style or the ‚ÄúDragonslaying on a Timetable‚Äù style. Inspired partially by this thread, I did a quick write-up of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/160M8iXPRF8sGIFhtZGhCX-p4AnfLFMAgIk7Qnw568VI/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">how exactly I do that</a> for those interested.</p>
<p>When I run DW games, I always using the Minimal Playbooks Plus from Greg Soper (who designed the OSW playbooks as well). I usually replace Alignment with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jBt9n6WK_vibMjGALNDg4D1GN8dd2x1N758kz1OrKo/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">Drives</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TMtedwe7X_CZ6K07rdJfGR904RgamtFJYOXLUaia87E/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=116013665970125878211" rel="nofollow noopener">Keys</a>, and Jeremy‚Äôs <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18HVXpyAiWP-q9dh2W3G8ni8vj7gJJGc_souVWmT3kqA/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">Revised Debilities</a>.</p>
<p>I think I might start running Homebrew World instead of OSW, though - I prefer it in many ways.</p>

          <p>My social interaction move that I mentioned:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sway Hearts &amp; Minds</strong></p>
<p>When you are <em>swaying the hearts and minds of others</em> or otherwise find yourself socially or intimately in a vulnerable position, say how you are putting yourself out there, what you hope to achieve and roll. If you do it‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li>‚Ä¶by being physically imposing or impressive, +Str</li>
<li>‚Ä¶by tricking their senses or distracting them, +Dex</li>
<li>‚Ä¶by being stoic and stubborn, or just laughing it off +Con</li>
<li>‚Ä¶by arguing your case, wether in good faith or not, +Int</li>
<li>‚Ä¶by being insightful and empathic, or preying on their weaknesses +Wis</li>
<li>‚Ä¶by inspiring or playing to their emotions, +Cha</li>
</ul>
<p>On a 10+, you do what you set out to do and you do not suffer a backlash.<br>
On a 7-9, you come across as awkward, desperate or fumble your message: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>And the peripheral move about managing overwhelming odds (I found this useful for when combats go south or things have gotten real bad with a Threat, to escalate appropriately):</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Escaping a Horde</strong></p>
<p>When you are <em>trying to escape a horde</em>, describe how you are trying to get away and the GM will tell you what Modifier to add to your roll. On a 10+, choose 3. 7-9, 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>You manage to keep one of your companions close and in sight, choose who.</li>
<li>You do not take 2d6 damage in the fight against their endless numbers.</li>
<li>You do not lose the main weapon you were carrying.</li>
<li>You are not taken prisoner.</li>
<li>You are able to cut down your damage die times your level in enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a 6- still choose 1 but be prepared for the worst!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>It‚Äôs basically ‚Äújust‚Äù an elaborate way <em>to separate them</em>.</p>

          <p>It‚Äôs really more about personal preferences. Essentially, after playing DW two-to-four times a month over a two year period as a ‚Äúone shot‚Äù system I felt there were a lot of changes that could be made in order to accommodate that style of play. So I gave myself a goal: facilitate ‚Äúone shot‚Äù play (particularly in regards to teaching new players), but stay as close to DW core as possible.</p>
<p>In the end, this was an excellent constraint to have, the product of which I‚Äôm very proud of. However, like many other veteran DW GMs, I grew to dislike a number of core elements, and in my long-form games/campaigns began to swap in new rules, hacks, etc. I ran other systems (both DW-derived and not) and began to truly move away from the core DW experience. You can hear more about this in the Gauntlet panel I did with <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jeremy_strandberg">@Jeremy_Strandberg</a> (how that happened I‚Äôll never know).</p>
<p>Homebrew World, in my estimation, realizes an ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù version of DW, while keeping to the goal of the original system. This is just my interpretation of course; who am I to say what the creators intended? Anyways, HBW has a number of revisions and alterations (as Strandberg laid out earlier in this thread) which match my particular preferences; there are a few I might add someday, but FWIW, it seems an ideal form of the game. At the very least, it‚Äôs more interesting! The Supply/Inventory system is completely original, and takes one of my favorite abstraction concepts, and dials it up to 11. Also, have you seen those playbooks? I totally stole the ‚Äúlook‚Äù of those for the final build of OSW.</p>
<p>Hope that clears things up. Thanks for the question.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/yochaigal">@yochaigal</a>! That‚Äôs very helpful. I‚Äôve played using OSW (which was a great time, and I plan to use it in my ongoing campaign to do a series of one-shots that fill in some history), but not HW yet, and I hope I can try it sometime soon. I seem to be drifting in the opposite direction, finding Freebooters to be pretty close to my optimal version of DW. I know there‚Äôs a lot of debate in the community about making DW more PBTA-like and less D&amp;D, but I find that Freebooters manages to lean into the D&amp;Disms and make a more coherent game experience than stock DW. Most of the attempted ‚Äú2E‚Äù hacks of DW haven‚Äôt appealed to me much, but HW does, so I‚Äôll have to see how I feel about it in play.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll also be honest that for some reason I am having trouble grokking the inventory system, even though it seems like it should simplify things.</p>

It‚Äôs closer to the OSR experience I am looking for, honestly - and the worldbuilding is top-notch! So yeah, right there with you.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out the inventory system as well, but I pestered Jeremy so often he finally broke it down for me. He did an excellent write up <a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/08/gear-slots-and-supplies-in-homebrew.html" rel="nofollow noopener">on his blog</a> about it as well.</p>
