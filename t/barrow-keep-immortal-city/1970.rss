Growing up, you learned to cherish the keep: it&#39;s heavy walls, high towers, and busy rulers ensured you were brought in a place at once safe and cosmopolitan. Now you are coming of age and should make your destiny and find your place. When the Family of Barrow Keep asked you to join a delegation to the Immortal City, you were glad for the chance to prove yourself. But nothing in the city is what you expected.

Barrow Keep is a playbook-driven fantasy adventure game in the spirit of Beyond the Wall. You are the heirs, the wards, the apprentices, and young courtiers of Barrow Keep, and you must do what the more senior members of the house cannot: protect the keep from the enemies that have already come into its walls.

This is a playtest series and we&#39;ll be using a simple OSR-inspired system to test the playbooks and scenario packs of Barrow Keep.

Being able to attend each session is strongly encouraged. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Each session is scheduled to run for 3 hours and will be recorded.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools such as Lines and Veils and [The X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.
