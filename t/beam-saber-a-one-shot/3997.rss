This session is scheduled for 4 hours. If everyone is comfortable with it, this session will be streamed on You Don&#39;t Meet In An Inn&#39;s twitch channel. Further my preference is to organize on the [Beam Saber Discord](https://discord.gg/WuC8r5W) server, and use Zoom for video calls, as they are the programs I am most familiar with. Both are free to use, and I&#39;ll share a link for the video call in Discord on the day of the session.

We will be playing a one shot of Beam Saber by Austin Ramsay (ME!), so there&#39;s no deeper commitment. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Beam Saber is a game about the pilots of powerful machines in a war that dominates every facet of life. They are trying to do their time and part, and get out physically and mentally intact. The organizations that perpetuate The War through all of known space are too incomprehensibly huge to take down. There is no “winning” The War, there is only surviving it. Hopefully you can help others get out too.

The Hatchetmen, a low level info-sec Squad working for the Adamant Council of Nor, are transporting a secretive package over land routes through Journey City&#39;s Broken Bank. Capture it for the 99th Intelligence Corp of the Democratic Federated Systems, and don&#39;t let it fall into enemy hands.

There&#39;s a light escort (2 light AWVs; machine gun, light armor, wheeled), but the Norrish are primarily relying on secrecy to protect the package. The package is in a roundish 6 wheeled APC (SAW, armor, wheeled), but we don&#39;t have specifics beyond that. Good luck.

We&#39;ll be using the X-Card. Lines include sexual violence, racism, and discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation. Veils include sex, and gore. Any additional Lines or Veils can be discussed in preparation for the session.
