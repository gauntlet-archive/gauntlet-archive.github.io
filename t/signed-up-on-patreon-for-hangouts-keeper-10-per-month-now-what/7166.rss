    <title>Signed up on Patreon for Hangouts Keeper $10 per month — now what?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/signed-up-on-patreon-for-hangouts-keeper-10-per-month-now-what/7166</link>
    <description>I&#39;m new to Gauntlet. I would like to RSVP for a few games before they are available to all, which I believe is one of the benefits of the $10/month tier. 

How do I know my account at https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com is set up correctly?</description>
