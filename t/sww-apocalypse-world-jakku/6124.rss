    <description>Star Wars Wednesdays: Apocalypse World - Jakku

Wednesdays in January at 7 pm CST 

In a galaxy far, far away there lies a planet that is for those who can thrive in the harshest environments. Jakku.

Generations before the one who would become a new Skywalker came from Jakku there were those who were just making their way on the planet. Hutt cartels dealing in crime, scavenging Toydarian hunters, and traveling packs of mercenaries stalk the sands of Jakku demanding respect and threatening the lives of the common man. Luckily you aren&#39;t common at all, unlike that Bantha fodder that litter the path to greatness.

You are something damn special; are you an Iktochi Brainer who has the insights blessed by the Force in the universe? A Gamorrean Gunlugger with enough destructive power to frighten an entire settlement? A Hutt Hardholder with people held in your hand? Or a Togruta Mutha viciously protecting your family? Jakku holds ample room for many champions.

We will be crafting tales of people on this world and how they survive on a world fully covered by Star Wars. This Apocalypse World will be set during the years of 17 – 19 AFE. Jakku is not that important in the grand scheme of things, yet. It is important in your life though.

Let&#39;s tell a story of survival in the stars. Let&#39;s light up the night. May the Force be with you.
