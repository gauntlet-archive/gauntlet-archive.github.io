    <title>Thoughts from the Farrier&#39;s Bellows: Psi*Run</title>

    <description>First, thank you for the nice overview of Psi*Run. It&#39;s been an early staple of gaming for Corridor Games on Demand out here in Eastern Iowa for a while, thanks in part to the original designers living out here and they playtested at a point in time when indie gaming was starting to take root.

Second, the love for Psi*Run is great. And there have been some fun hacks and related designs.

I created a quick and dirty hack for settings with parallel worlds called NetWhere--initially for Matrix-inspired games. It has some additional fiddley bits that allow the Players and GM to alter things much like the source material.

And now I&#39;m continuing to work on NightMirror which is my version of Psi*Run for Gothic Horror stories like Penny Dreadful, substituting tarot cards for the dice. 

It&#39;s been a great design journey and I&#39;m so grateful for experiencing Psi*Run.</description>

I think this downtime and mundanity like <a class="mention" href="/u/davidmk">@DavidMK</a> mentions are things that I’m missing from my Psi-Run games. That’s something I’d like to focus more on as I return to it–trying to slow down events and get people exploring inner issues. Usually our Psi-Run games feel pretty frenetic and chaotic and I think some slow, calm scenes would be nice. I have no idea how to push that mechanically, though.</p>

              <p>Thanks all! Glad you enjoyed the episode!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/beepeegee">@beepeegee</a> I want to play a magical girl game of Psi-Run <em>so badly</em>. I’m thinking a leaning hard into Madoka-like? Would be so good.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/larry_s">@Larry_S</a> I haven’t put too much thought into it, but I think it could partially be helped by the rule that no one should roll twice in a row, which would be an excellent place to hand over control of threats like Chasers or other NPCs. I’d either give the GM’s answers on rolls to the player who had just rolled previously or put it up to the group. It would certainly require a good group willing to push themselves and their luck. I  <em>really</em>  need to try this soon.</p>
