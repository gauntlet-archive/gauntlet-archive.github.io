          <p>I present to you the <a href="https://teylen.blog/2021/03/04/crowdfunding-zine-collection-161/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>new Crowdfunding Zine Collection #161, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/15 and 03/03</b></a>.</p>
<p>This collection contains about 82 ZineQuest projects, which is completed by 76 „normal“ crowdunding projects.<br>
As the collection spans a bit more than two weeks, some projects have ended. You’ll find the ended projects at the end of the list. Considering the many projects, I only highlight those I backed or marked for consideration.</p>
<p>In regards of the ZineQuest, I would like to highlight and recommend the work by Emily McGlawn. She collected all ZineQuest projects from marginalised folks into one google document. Which offers the added information, which of these projects funded, and which didn’t.</p>
<p>I personally find the psychedelic artwork of <b>Aether Operations RPG</b> intruiging, and hence marked it for future considerations. Then there’s <b>Little Katy’s Tea Party</b>, a game about helping a girl to grow up. I like the „Alice in Wonderland“ look, and thus might go down that rabbit hole. Focusing on boys and men, I actually backed <b>BLOOD FEUD</b>. A game all about vikings and toxic masculinity. A quite interesting topic. As quite some contrast, I might chip into <b>Necrojerks</b>. The players take the role of said jerks, some undead one, and do their evil bidings. The illustration of <b>Contemplation</b> got me contemplating whether or not to back the zine,… which is usuable as a solo game, micro rpg or NPC design aide. Last but not least I backed <b>DM Yourselves</b>, which promises help in regards to turn any adventure into a solo experience to enjoy. You’ll find these, and many more projects in here::</p>
