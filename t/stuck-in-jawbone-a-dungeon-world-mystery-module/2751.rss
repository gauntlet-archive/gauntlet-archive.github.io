    <description>The latest playtest version of my Dungeon World module [Stuck in Jawbone](https://bethanyharvey.itch.io/jawbone) is PWYW on itch.io, in case you&#39;re in the mood for a mystery with a little Weird West flavor and lots of interwoven secrets.

I think the coolest feature is the sheer number of entry points into the mystery. Investigate a cursed mountain town with a haunted temple, a sewer full of invasive predators, and a sinister magical factory. Get involved in local family dramas. Interact with sad ghosts, an old man who keeps challenging you to duels, or a girl with a secret identity. They all have clues, and they&#39;re all related -- but it might not be clear how until the end.

I originally wrote it as a starter for a longer campaign, but the central mystery is meant to fit into a Gauntlet-style 4-5 session series. I&#39;d love some feedback from anyone who runs it with Dungeon World or any other system as I work on the next version.</description>
