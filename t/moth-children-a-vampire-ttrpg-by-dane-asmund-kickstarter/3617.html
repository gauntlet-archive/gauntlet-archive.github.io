          <p>I keep an eye on upcoming Kickstarters during the week in preparation of my collection. Which saw me coming across the <strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosmicmirrorgames/moth-children/" rel="nofollow noopener">Moth Children</a></strong> vampire game byof Dane Asmund.</p>
<p>It sparked my interest as I am very interested in Vampire games and storytelling mechanics and the project combines both. Including an approach to the mythology that I consider fresh and was quite new to me.</p>
<p>The game system is based on the players filling out their wheel of abilities and the storyteller having a wheel of their own with some of the difficulties noted. When a conflict occurs the numbers get compared and a result is determined. With the difficulty wheel being adjusted.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether I grasp it in full, but it does sound interesting.<br>
The only thing that I might adjust would be, to maybe set the world in a fashion that vampires aren’t antagonistic to each other and got different ways of obtaining a new moth. Maybe give it a bit of a VtM reskinning ^^;</p>
<p>What do you think of it?</p>
