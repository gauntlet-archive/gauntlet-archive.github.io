              <p>I use Stars &amp; Wishes but I explicitly position the Wishes as “ways you want our game to evolve, whether adding, removing, or changing elements.” Generally players take the opportunity to say what they want more of.</p>
<p>And in the case where I could tell someone didn’t like something in the game but didn’t mention it in front of the group (or on stream, which adds another layer of complexity), I check in with them privately later. Often it wasn’t a big deal but they universally have always appreciated the attention and focus on their comfort in the game.</p>

              <p>How have you not heard of the Jason and the Argonauts movie? Come on, man!</p>
<p>This was a good episode. There really are a dearth of adventures that focus on teaching. Tower of the Stargazer from LotFP is quite good, and also has explicit discussion of how to run the adventure and why things are the way they are. I think it’s one of my favourites. (The Grindhouse boxed set also came with an adventure that I think also has advice on running adventures, but I can’t recall now.)</p>
<p>The first level of Dwimmermount (by James M from Grognardia) is also a really solid dungeon with all the trappings you’d want: mystery, secret rooms, factions, traps, clues, etc. But it’s not available in a format I would buy right now. One day. It’s not meant to teach, but I think is a good example of what you want in an interesting dungeon.</p>

              <p>Great episode!</p>
<p>I was thinking about the check in issue Jason mentioned.</p>
<p>If you think it’ll be an issue addressing the current discontentment you could do some fact finding without directly confronting the currently adventure. During a break talk to the player about what other games they are looking forward to this weekend, or games they have really enjoyed in the past. Just do something to help them make an emotional connection to something they enjoyed and see if in their telling of that event you can find seeds to plant in the current session.</p>
<p>Heck, sometimes just having a positive conversation can pull people out of a mild funk.</p>
