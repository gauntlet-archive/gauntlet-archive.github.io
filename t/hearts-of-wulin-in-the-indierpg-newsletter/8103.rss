    <title>Hearts of Wulin in the indieRPG newsletter</title>

    <description>In his last newsletter, Thomas Manuel mentions &quot;Entanglements&quot; from Hearts of Wulin. Strange, as character relationship maps are old as Vampire the Masquerade 1e. I would have chosen &quot;Inner conflict&quot; and Scales, two really great and innovative approaches. But that was nice of him anyway! and it&#39;s true that the **list** of entanglements is really neat.</description>
