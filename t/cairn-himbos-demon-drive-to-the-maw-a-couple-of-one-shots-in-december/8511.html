<p><strong>One spot in the Himbos game is saved for José. One spot in the Cairn game is saved for Blake Ryan. I don’t recommend signing up for both of these games, but if you really want to, please don’t sign up for the second for at least 48 hours.</strong></p>
<p>I thought I’d try running this adventure in two different systems, partly bc I am interested in how different it turns out but partly just bc it seems like a really fun adventure and I wanna play both these games.</p>
<p>Himbos is a rules-light fantasy game by Maxwell Lander about big, bold, brave, compassionate but not particularly smart adventurers of all genders. Cairn is a rules-light fantasy game by Yochai Gal about more standard hardscrabble adventurer types, based on Into The Odd. Both are OSR-influenced but Himbos has a fairly light, campy tone and Cairn has a more desperate-and-deadly playstyle. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play.</p>
<p>Demon Driven To The Maw is a module by Brad Kerr that sees the party track down the thief of a magical jewel to a castle where a big party is underway. Of course, something terrible is happening at the party, but maybe you can still retrieve the jewel and escape with your lives.</p>
<p>Subject matter in these games will include alcohol use, peril to a child, claustrophobia and violence. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the games will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>I’ve listed both games for four hours to make sure we have enough time, but expect we’ll finish closer to three hours.</p>
<p>I’ll email players prior to the sessions to share play materials and other details.</p>
