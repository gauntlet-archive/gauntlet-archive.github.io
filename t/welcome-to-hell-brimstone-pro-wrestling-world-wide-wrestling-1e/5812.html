<p>‚ÄúIt was all fun and games on that plane ride - the boys had been getting loud, throwing a few back, you know how it goes. The plane was delayed, we got a little rowdy at the airport bar ‚Ä¶ it was just good fun, and we didn‚Äôt really want it to stop once we got on the plane, right? It was just a little harmless fun, some horseplay. We didn‚Äôt mean for anything bad to happen. Honest.‚Äù</p>
<p>Azakorth The Taciturn, Chief Disemboweler of the 17th Baleful Host looks at you thoughtfully.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMaybe so chucklehead, but your plane ride FROM Hell turned into a plane ride TO Hell. Next time - not that there‚Äôs gonna be one, being as you‚Äôre here and all and the boss ain‚Äôt too keen on letting people out - maybe don‚Äôt let 650 pounds of performance-enhanced meat hit the emergency exit lever while the plane is cruising at 35,000 feet. Now. Let‚Äôs talk about how you‚Äôre going to entertain us ‚Ä¶ and if you‚Äôre lucky and the boss takes a shine to you, maybe ‚Ä¶  <em>just maybe</em>  ‚Ä¶ you can get out of here with your entrails intact.‚Äù</p>
<p>Players will assume the role of professional wrestlers who, after horsing around on a 747 and inadvertently causing it to crash, find themselves in Hell. As the age old question goes ‚Ä¶ what do you do? Do you work with your fellow condemned wrestlers to try to escape? Do you try to save your own skin? Do you suck up to a demon and try to make yourself useful, hoping they won‚Äôt kill you for insulting their intelligence? Or do you try to become a demon yourself? There is only one thing certain about being on the roster in Brimstone Pro Wrestling - you‚Äôre damned if you do and damned if you don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>This session will use a lengthy list of Lines and Veils to facilitate an initial baseline for player safety. Players are absolutely encouraged to add more topics to the list for their own safety. This session will also use the N-Card, X-Card, and Script Change as necessary to adjust the game while it‚Äôs in progress to maintain player safety. Finally, the Open Door Policy is always in effect and players may leave at any time for any length of time for any reason.</p>
<p>This session will also adhere to The Gauntlet‚Äôs Community Code of Conduct: <a href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gauntlet-rpg.com%2Fcommunity-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html</a></p>
<p>RSVP OPEN ACCESS TIME: 9/10, 8 p.m. Central time<br>
SET UP INFO: We will use Streamyard for the event and, if all participants consent, it will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube.<br>
BREAKS: We‚Äôll take two 5-10 minute breaks.<br>
PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: No experience required, rules will be taught.<br>
A seat is being saved for Ferret.</p>
