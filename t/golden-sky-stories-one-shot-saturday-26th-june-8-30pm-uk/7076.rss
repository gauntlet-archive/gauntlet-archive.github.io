*A space in this game is being held for Elizabeth*

&quot;*Someone* is troubled by *something*&quot; that&#39;s the basis of every adventure in Golden Sky Stories. Someone is troubled by something and it&#39;s down to you to help them. It calls itself heartwarming and from my experiences it has never failed to do.

Originally released in Japan as Yuuyake Koyake, Golden Sky Stories is a heartwarming, non-violent role-playing game that’s great fun for all ages. It takes place in a small town in rural Japan, and players take on the role of henge (pronounced hen-gay, like a chicken that’s happy), animals with just a little magical power, including the ability to temporarily take human form. They do not fight great battles or unearth valuable treasures though; Golden Sky Stories adventures are all about helping others and becoming friends.
