I am running a session of my hack of PH Lee&#39;s Hot Guys Making Out, Cute Boys Holding Hands. CBHH is inspired by coming of age films such as History Boys, Billy Elliott, Beautiful Thing and Stand By Me. It is about a budding relationship between two boys at a South Yorkshire grammar school in the Summer of 1984, at the height of the Miners Strike. In some ways polar opposites, the boys are united by their outsider status at the school. Between us, we will play the two boys, Simon and Jack, their English teacher Miss Rayne, and Simon’s closest friend Jo. (If we are able to play two games, we will swap roles after the first)

The session will be played at [date=2019-04-07 time=16:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot;], and will last for approximately 3.5 hours.
