    <description>**Cinematic Action Roleplaying** , by Kyle Simons (SJK Publishing)

Two x repeating 2-shots set in  **the world of Nights Black Agents** , by Ken Hite (Pelgrane Press)

In each case, attendance at both sessions is ideal but not required. The sessions are scheduled for 3 hours and will be recorded.

You used to serve your country in the shadows, doing things — or stopping things — that couldn’t be shown on the evening news. Then you stopped. Maybe you got tired, or maybe you got burned, or maybe you got out while you could. But you didn’t go legit. You stayed in the shadows, in Europe’s deniable underground networks of crime and conflict. You worked for money in secret accounts, and for people you didn’t know. But they weren’t people. It turned out they couldn’t be shown in daylight or on the evening news either. Because they were vampires.

Now you know. And they know that you know. So you’d better start tracing their operations, penetrating their networks, following their trail, and targeting their weak points.

Because if you don’t hunt them, they will hunt you. And they will kill you … or worse …

The X-card will be in use. For more information on the Gauntlet&#39;s safety tools, please refer to our Inclusivity Policy on the website (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

With … <a href="https://gauntlet-rpg.slack.com/team/U0SBDG0RF" rel="nofollow noopener">@rob_ruthven</a>, <a href="https://gauntlet-rpg.slack.com/team/U2K7HRW48" rel="nofollow noopener">@donogh</a> &amp; <a href="https://gauntlet-rpg.slack.com/team/U87UF96KE" rel="nofollow noopener">@JimLikesGames</a> (sadly <a href="https://gauntlet-rpg.slack.com/team/UEXEAFS90" rel="nofollow noopener">@Kevin Marshall [he/him]</a> had to drop for technical reasons).<br>
This was a re-run of the same 2-shot of NBO with a new cast willing to help me beat the Operator rule-set into submission …<br>
The team meet their informant in the small hours outside the National Theatre on London’s South Bank only for all hell to break loose.  Our Driver dropped a speedboat on the embankment (and a Conspiracy frogman); our Muscle took out another assailant, but despite the best parkour efforts of our Investigator/Interrogator the sniper, who took out the contact, escaped.  Identities were concealed, then impersonated.  Conspiracy watchers were run down and a crooked book dealer convinced into handing over the Van Helsing Letter.  Who knows where session 2 will take us …<br>
Particular thanks to Jim for sharing his Zoom access for this session. (edited)<br>

The team travels from Strasbourg, across Germany without their Iranian Muscle, having gutted the Van Helsing Letter for information.  They quickly discover what they are up against after our Cuckoo (<a class="mention" href="/u/edige23">@edige23</a>) takes a call from an unknown caller and finds herself providing the team’s cutting edge; our Analyst (<a class="mention" href="/u/ainar_miyata-sturm">@Ainar_Miyata-Sturm</a>) comes up with a secret weapon against the monster; while our Hacker (<a class="mention" href="/u/will_h">@Will_H</a>) makes the Conspiracy’s base system his bitch … after that it’s all about killing the monster and rescuing the damsel in distress.<br>

Blake (the British Hacker/Tech), Eun-Jung (the Korean-Amercian Cuckoo), Behrouz (the Iranian Muscle) and Nadia (the Norwegian Analyst) receive a tip-off about ‘The Conspiracy’ but their informant, Markov, is taken out before they can meet her in fashionable West London.<br>
Meanwhile our villain (played by Michael Shannon) is revealed in his opulent Paris apartment planning the next steps in HIS operation …<br>
A clue leads the characters to the Ille de la Cite in Strasbourg and an old contact of Nadia’s.  Some soft and hard talk gets him to hand over the package Markov sent him just as some goons begin to machine gun his bookshop under cover of ‘road repairs’.  Our heroes escape using cunning disguise, fast feet or ‘Iranian Parkour’, across the rooftops, to find that the package contains a letter dated 1908 and signed by … Abraham Van Helsing …<br>
In two parts due to a Jitsi-issue …<br>

              <p>In preparation of this I’ve been re-listening to the wonderful RPPR campaign, <em><a href="http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/tribes-of-tokyo-a-nights-black-agents-campaign/" rel="nofollow noopener">Tribes of Tokyo</a></em>. A Japanese private security company encounters a conspiracy after investigating a common street thug. What is the drug Reverb - and does it really allow time travel? What secrets are held in the Long Vault? And where the hell do these damn vampires keep coming from!?</p>
<p>A wonderful horror/spy thriller of asymmetric warfare, tradecraft and brilliant exploitation of the Gumshoe system’s ability to stack the odds in your favour retrospectively. Throw in some Mythos and the streets of Tokyo will never be the same again…</p>
<p>(Warning- it’s many parts and it’s quite long but I love hearing how one player commits to complete tradecraft and tackles the conspyramid on its own level. Like a fat, Japanese Smiley vs immortal monsters)</p>
