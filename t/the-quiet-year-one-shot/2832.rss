    <description>![Quite%20Year%20JPG|577x500](upload://ddfSPK6h1KiypPrAWZ8BCvBxXWj.png) 
This session is scheduled for 3.5 hours and will be a one shot. 

For a long time, we were at war with The Jackals. Now, finally, we’ve driven them off, and we’re left with this: a year of relative peace. One quiet year, with which to build our community up and  learn again how to work together. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive the encounter. This is when the game will end. But we don’t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.

This is a map-drawing game. We will collectively explore the struggles of a community, trying to rebuild after the collapse of civilization. It’s a game about community, difficult choices, and landscapes. When we play, we will make decisions about the community, decisions that get recorded on a map that is constantly evolving. Parts of the map will be literal cartography, while other parts are symbolic. Players will work together to create and steer this community, but they also play devil’s advocate and introduce problems and tensions into the game.

This is my first time running a game for the Gauntlet and I am not planning on recording it because I’m not quite sure how to get Jitsi to work with YouTube yet. This may change if I have time to figure it out before the session. 

This will be an Open Table, the X-Card and Lines and Veils will be in Play as well as the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.
