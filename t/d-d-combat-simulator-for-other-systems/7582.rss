    <title>D&amp;D Combat Simulator for other systems?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/d-d-combat-simulator-for-other-systems/7582</link>
    <description>So while I wrote a 5th edition D&amp;D Combat Simulator (https://dndcombat.com) 

What other systems (Pathfinder seems obvious) do you think would benefit from such a tool?

I plan on doing 2nd edition since I grew up with that one but do you think there are any OSR systems that would be fun with it or are they all a little niche/combat too simple.</description>
