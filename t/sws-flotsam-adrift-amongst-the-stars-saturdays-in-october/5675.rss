FLOTSAM: Adrift Amongst The Stars is a roleplaying game about outcasts, renegades and misfits living in the belly of a space station, in the shadow of a more prosperous society. You play through their everyday lives, interpersonal relationships and small-scale drama in The Below, a dangerous world where poverty, social strife and gang conflict sit side-by-side with alien technology and supernatural weirdness.

The game is GMless and diceless, with rules that point your characters at each other and bring their relationships into sharp focus. They help you quickly create a rich setting, flawed characters, and charged relationships which develop over time. You’ll watch your characters evolve and change before your eyes.
