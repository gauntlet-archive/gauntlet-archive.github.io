    <description>*[Thousand Year Old Vampire](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/)* by Tim Hutchings is fabulous. 

I am reading through it and am now a big fan.

I love how it **provides incite** into its: 
1) **subject-mater** (the embodied reality of immortality), 
2) **human nature** (the relationship between memory and identity), and 
3) **the craft** of a journaling game itself (it contains essentially a mood-board of  vampire related photographs and mechs that really capture the sense of stumbling through eras). 

I have never played a single player journaling RPG before. 

What are your favorite journaling games? And **how do they explore** the intersection of journaling and role-playing in compelling new ways?

              <p>Err nothing more : people leaving reviews about the place, one after the other. A bit like an epistolary game, only each one is solo, hence : journaling, multi-solo ? It goes straight to the juice. You can look it up on itch : <a href="https://zargogames.itch.io/yowl">https://zargogames.itch.io/yowl</a></p>
