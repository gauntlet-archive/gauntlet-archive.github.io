    <title>Designing as my younger self</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/designing-as-my-younger-self/1964</link>
    <description>It recently came to my mind as a thought experiment: if I had the design tools, and community backing at hand I have now, what kind of games would I have made as a younger person? 

Which mechanics, which settings, which play style would have been my interest in design? Something I wouldn&#39;t do anymore? But maybe should consider? 

How about you? Aren&#39;t we all roleplayers and able to roleplay our younger self designer for a moment? 

Setting: 
Age 11-20: Gothic climate apocalypse (as I was a goth and political activist)
Age 21-30: German House of Cards (as I was working at the Bundestag)

Style: 
Age 14-22: ritualistic, with stimulants, hedonistic
Age 23-30: highly analytical, precise &amp; codified, large groups</description>

              <p>So tools and backing, but not exposure to more recent systems? I did actually write up these… curious combinations we’ll call them… back in the day</p>
<p>Age 19-21 : a Rolemaster Palladium hybrid… percentage skills, profession for every class combo, lots of abilities for every profession. Style would be dark fantasy, conan/lankmar</p>
<p>Age 22-26 : a Mage the Ascension/Shadowrun hybrid, 2D6+stat+skill, less high end cyber/weapons, more competing factions in the cities, some based in astral space</p>
<p>one last point - I once asked on usenet forums if anyone has mashed up shadowrun and darksun, the only response was ‘You are evil and must be destroyed’ <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
