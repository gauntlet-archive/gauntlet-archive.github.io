          <p>So tools and backing, but not exposure to more recent systems? I did actually write up these… curious combinations we’ll call them… back in the day</p>
<p>Age 19-21 : a Rolemaster Palladium hybrid… percentage skills, profession for every class combo, lots of abilities for every profession. Style would be dark fantasy, conan/lankmar</p>
<p>Age 22-26 : a Mage the Ascension/Shadowrun hybrid, 2D6+stat+skill, less high end cyber/weapons, more competing factions in the cities, some based in astral space</p>
<p>one last point - I once asked on usenet forums if anyone has mashed up shadowrun and darksun, the only response was ‘You are evil and must be destroyed’ <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
