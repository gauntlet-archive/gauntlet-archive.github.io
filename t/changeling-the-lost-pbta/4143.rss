This is for four sessions of PbtA *Changeling the Lost* . This is a hack of CtL I wrote, so it is- in part- a playtest. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged but not required. In session one we’ll create characters from playbooks and work on the group’s Freehold. Play assumes some PbtA knowledge; I’ve used elements from *Urban Shadows* and *Masks*. Sessions run just shy of three three hours.

Changelings, also known as the Lost, are humans who were abducted by the Fae. Unlike most who suffer this fate, the Lost have managed to find their way back through the Hedge to the mortal world, but their time in the Faerie realm (Arcadia) has irrevocably changed their bodies, minds and souls. A Changeling&#39;s true, inhuman mien is hidden by his Mask, the aspect of Fae magic that makes Faerie creatures and artefacts seem mundane to mortal eyes. Very few Changelings are able to reclaim their old lives, or make entirely new ones without retaining ties to the fae realm.

I will send a group email out about a week before the session to check in. We will record the session for later posting. If you sign up and your attendance changes, please drop from the sign up and message me at edige23 at gmail. You can find my write up on it here as well as a link to the pdf: http://bit.ly/2pAlKHa. That&#39;s an earlier version of the system, we&#39;ll be playing with an updated version.

The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in effect and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) safety tool will be in use.
