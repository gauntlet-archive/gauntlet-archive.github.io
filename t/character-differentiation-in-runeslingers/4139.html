<p>I’ve identified what I think is a specific issue I need to address. RuneSlingers is partly inspired by RuneQuest, so it doesn’t have character classes. Like RQ, characters are primarily differentiated by the skills and magic they know. The things that distinguish a character in RQ are your culture which affects fighting styles and available skills, your profession which is skills again and the cult you belong to, which determines what magic you can have.</p>
<p>RuneSlingers is based on the World of Dungeons system but doesn’t have character classes. You can take whatever skills you like. You can also take whatever Rune Charms (basic spells) you want. The main differentiator is Feats. You get up to two from your Calling (equivalent to a cult in RuneQuest), but can also gain them from other callings. There is a limit, you have to get both feats from your Calling first, and can only take one feat from any one other calling, but that’s it. A level 4 character would have two feats from other callings. Maybe that’s a bit too much flexibility?</p>
<p>I’m a little concerned this isn’t enough differentiation. First and second level characters will be distinguished quite a lot by their feats, but after that not so much. I’ve done a bit of play testing with first level characters which went really well, but it’s hard to extrapolate how it would go up to 4th level.</p>
<p>Another way to differentiate might be to make skills more significant, so that skill choices are also a bigger factor.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
