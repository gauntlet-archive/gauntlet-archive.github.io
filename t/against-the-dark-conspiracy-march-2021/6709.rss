    <description>We meet Christian Okafor (former MI6 Provocateur); Devereaux Sinclair (freelancing former CIA Scalp Hunter); Mick Cornwall (Aussie Five Eyes SIGINT Handler gone rogue); and Sophia Manzanares (retired US Secret Service Driver) as they get a lead from a confidential source known only as &#39;Madame Mina&#39;.  There&#39;s streets full of celebrating locals, a reception at Amsterdam&#39;s Rijksmuseum, and shady security inside and out.  Then a chase through the museum, desperate efforts to scan a picture, glitching comms ... and The Night Watch aflame ...

              <p>Sophia is missing and all leads point to a castle in Portugal where famous but reclusive fashion designer Rui Pereira is staging his pre-season show. Christian impersonates a fashion buyer to get the inside track, and an invitation; Dev slips into the comfortable role of bodyguard; and Mick insets himself into the list of accredited journalists. There’s a show, vampire on vampire friction, and an explosive distraction … then a dungeon, a rescue attempt and the final parting of fraternal ways …</p>

              <p>Debriefing Kat Hulier hints at mysterious activity on a private island in the Adriatic. After trying to add detail to the situation we cut to a hotel where the team establish some complicated history while seeking relief from the horror carried forward from the last Operation. Then they get to the island using a cover developed in earlier scenes and divide their effort between the ‘inside men’ and the ‘intrusion women’.  There’s occult symbology and an ancient grotto beneath a war criminal’s palatial villa where some of them enjoy an entertaining drinks party.  Then … a surprise, a set-up, and a confrontation … and an explosion …</p>
