    <title>On the restriction from using text from the forums</title>

    <description>I believe I know why that rule is in place, too keep discussions from being taken out of context, but it might be worth clarifying what ideas/words can be used outside the forums.  Specifically,  I was thinking about what goes on in the game design category.  The Ziggurratti thread made me stop and think about the copying restriction and how theoretically it might limit such discussions, as people realize they may not be able to use that text to actually develop the game.  Thoughts?</description>
