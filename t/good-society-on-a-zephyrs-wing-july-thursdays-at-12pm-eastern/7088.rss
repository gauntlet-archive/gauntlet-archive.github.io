    <description>**When:**   **Thursdays in July at 12 PM Eastern**  (July 1, 8, 22, 29 - *skipping the 15th* because I’m moving) (3 hours per session, with breaks at each hour)
**Where:**  **Streamyard**  &amp;  **Google Sheets**  (recorded and made public only with permission)
**Who: 4 players (+ me, the facilitator!)**

This is a  **4-session**  series of [Good Society](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/good-society/?v=7516fd43adaa) (the base game) by [Storybrewers Roleplaying.](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/) Because everyone plays secondary characters who are entangled in the lives of the major characters of the story, it’s highly recommended that you only sign up if you can attend all of the sessions (though, of course, life happens and we’ll handle it!).  **For the first 48 hours, please only sign up if you haven&#39;t played Good Society before!**  One spot in this game is reserved for Stentor D.

Good Society is a collaborative storytelling game that seeks to tell stories inspired by Jane Austen’s novels, which means stories about ambition, families, reputations, loyalties, love, longing, and (sometimes) lingering glances. Character relationships and the conflict between personal desires and external pressures are a big part of this game and it does not shy away from emotions and romance. Our first session will be mostly dedicated to collaborating about tone and subjects we want to avoid or explore while playing the game. Our game will be set in a fictionalized Regency England, but knowledge of either Jane Austen or history or England are not required (it’s all about the vibes, ya know).

We’ll be using Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, the X-Card, and the Open Door Policy. The [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will also be in effect. 

**Content warning and tone:**  The tone of the game can vary from intense drama to light romantic comedy and even farce. Romance and emotional entanglements are often included in character desires. Topics involving class, wealth, and societal expectations may arise. There is a Collaboration phase in which we will work out what we want to see and what we don&#39;t want to see in our game.

**Contact:**  I will email a confirmation to everyone a week in advance and email the Streamyard link a day before each session.
