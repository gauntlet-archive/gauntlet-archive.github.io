    <description>## Please Note!

* **Restricted Sign-up** : For the first 72 hours please sign up only if you have  **not**  played in one of my games previously.
* **Play test** : Rising Tide is currently in development. Please only sign up if you are OK to play a game that hasn’t been fully tested.

## The Setting

Following the environmental catastrophes of 2024, the world fell into chaos. Most coastal cities were flooded and uninhabitable. Most of the tropics had become too hot to live in, triggering massive migrations toward the poles. Although every nation reaffirmed their commitments to the Paris Climate Accords, the reliance on fossil fuels has barely diminished. Many governments continue to say one thing and do another, especially looking the other way 

## The Pitch

In [Rising Tide](https://cosmicbeagle.itch.io/rising-tide), you play an eco-activist group going on missions to thwart organizations continuing to harm the environment. Using the [Paragon system](https://community.bladesinthedark.com/t/paragon-system-for-agon-supplements-and-playsets/1810) (developed by John Harper and Sean Nittner), each mission consists of three or four contests, culminating in a final confrontation. Each contest is played as a distinct scene, leading to narrative-heavy play.

## At-a-Glance

* **System** : [Rising Tide](https://cosmicbeagle.itch.io/rising-tide) - Paragon System (in development)
* **The Pitch** : Post-crash eco-activist group taking direct action against people still committing atrocities against the environment.
* **Schedule** : Five Thursdays in September
* **Breaks** : Two 10-minute breaks
* **Venue** : GM’s Zoom
* **Recording Session** : With consent from all players
* **Posting Recording** : With consent from all players
* **Attendance** : Joining all sessions is ideal but not required
* **Safety** : Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, Open Table, and any others suggested by the players
