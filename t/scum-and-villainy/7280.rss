    <description>I&#39;m interested in if folks have used Scum and Villainy to run a Star Wars-related campaign. I used to GM FFG Star Wars (currently running 5e+OSR Spelljammer) and am always interested in space adventures. Have you run a space campaign? Tell me about your space adventures!

It seems like there&#39;s a ton of space travel game systems now and I&#39;m curious about all of them and how folks enjoy them.</description>

<p>That’s not a space campaign as such as it’s set on Coruscant, but it is Star Wars.</p>
<p>I have run a few sessions of Scum &amp; Villainy in the default setting for my ftf group, and it seems trivial to reskin it for Star Wars rules-wise. I think you’d want to have a reason for the PCs to stick around in the same few systems though.</p>
