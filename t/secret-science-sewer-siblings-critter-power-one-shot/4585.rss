You and your siblings are sewer animals mutated into bipedal beings with bodies and minds similar to human adolescents. You&#39;ve also been trained in ancient martial arts. Go rescue your mentor and learn to share pizza with your siblings!

[Secret Science Sewer Siblings](https://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/secret-science-sewer-siblings) is a simple tabletop RPG in the vein of Lasers &amp; Feelings. I designed it for the [On-Ramp Jam](https://itch.io/jam/onrampjam-igrc).

In the spirit of on-ramping, one slot is reserved for someone who has joined The Gauntlet in the last three months. Message me if you are interested in the slot.

This one-shot session will run three and a half hours. It will be recorded and posted on YouTube (if all players agree).

Aiming for a story of ninja action and mutant mayhem with just a dash of teen feels, rated PG. The X-Card, Open Door Policy, and Lines and Veils will be in use. This event abides by the [Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.htm).

The sewer siblings go bananas when they return to their sewer lair and find their mentor’s been nabbed! Can a slacker pigeon, an emo skunk, and a bunny buckling under the weight of leadership foil the evil plans of the Cosmorillas? And what will happen when their presumed dead former leader makes an appearance…as a cyborg monkey’s paw of the space apes?!<br>
