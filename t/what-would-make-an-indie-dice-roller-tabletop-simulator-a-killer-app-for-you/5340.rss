    <description>(really hope this is the right forum for this...)

I&#39;m going to be spending my weekend (and maybe next weekend too) working on [https://1kfa.com/table](https://www.1kfa.com/table), and while there are definitely some bugs that need fixing, I also want to add some new features.

So my question for you: what feature could this software have that would make *you* want to use it in your next online session? I think the most useful feedback is often the most specific, so feel free to get into the nitty gritty. If you want to see a Blades in the Dark character sheet that has buttons to press for Devil&#39;s Bargain, and it highlights when there are 2+ sixes, and it needs to be ready for your session next Friday, please get that specific.

If you&#39;ve got a Github account, you can drop requests and ideas in the [Issues](https://github.com/sjbrown/togetherness/issues) page, or just post something here.

(Note, if you&#39;re going to post about the Save / Load bugs and the Multiplayer state syncing bugs, I already know about them and those will be my first priorities this weekend)

Thanks so much for any feedback, and heck, thanks just for taking a look!</description>

              <p>New update!</p>
<p>I’ve found that Save/Load bug and used the opportunity to revamp the whole feature.  Now you can also Load a previously-saved state into your currently running state to add a “clone” the whole table.  It might be a handy way to create some pre-generated “templates”.</p>
<p>I also found a bunch of bugs with the Poker Deck that are now fixed.</p>
<p>I also made some improvements to the “add another” button. Basically it will add new objects next to the one you currently have selected.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the Tokens dialog, there’s an example of how to now add a token with a numerical value.  Any tspans that can be interpreted as a number will interact with Dynamic Papers just the same way that dice will.</p>
<p>As far as using the tool for a convention, absolutely!  I’d love to garner interest, especially if there are other devs that would want to contribute.</p>

              <p>It’s almost there!  If a second set of tokens was available (for a different denomination), this would be workable.  I like how I can find an image from the internet and post it on the chip.  One issue I did find though is that because my game requires a bit of setup, it would be great if I could save it.  No problem that I needed to save the scrip in a text file.  The issue upon reload though was that the card decks would no longer respond to my requests to flip the cards.</p>
<p>Edit:  If the tokens auto-sum, the multiple tokens becomes only a minor preference.  On another note, would it be possible for me to use this for a few playtests for an online convention in Nov?</p>

              <p>Thanks so much for this bug report!  When I read it I was like, “how is that even possible?”</p>
<p>But then, thanks to all the detail you provided I was able to make an educated guess at what might be happening. Investigation revealed the dice are responding to the “turn up” event multiple times! Clearly not the desired behavior!</p>
<p>The good news is, after thinking about it and puzzling over it for a while, I realized that the fix might be to make the code a whole lot simpler. I might even be able to have a net reduction in code. (In case you’re not familiar, the thing coders love most is deleting code)</p>
<p>So I’ll try to fix that in the coming days.</p>
<p>As far as a right click menu, one has been implemented, however it depends on the browser implementing the web standard. I think right now only Firefox implements the right click menu standard. Might be a good excuse to try Firefox!</p>
<p>Thanks again for the great bug report!</p>

              <p>In the beta I get some strange behaviour by turning up the dice. I wanted to have 4 tokens on a personal mat (dynamic paper) and sum them up. I then understood that the mat wouldn’t sum tokens so I added 4 dice to it, and tried to roll all dice up to 1. On roll up, the first die went “2 4 6 2 …”. So I tried to take the dice out of the mat and back again, and roll them a few times to get rid of this behaviour. On roll up, the first die went “6 5 4 3 2 1”, that is : counting backwards. Then the second die went “6 1” like it should. And the third went “3 3 3 3 3”. I had to get rid of this one. The next one went as expected, but some other did a “1 3 5 1” loop. It’s not a serious problem : it’s only a test, I can find a roundabout and setup a game anyway.<br>
Also I have to take the dice out of the mat to roll them up. Or rather, when I roll a die up, it falls through the mat.<br>
Summing up tokens would be simpler for my use.<br>
Finally, I keep right clicking on the dice : it looks like my finger wants a menu on right click. I am no slave to my finger, but I told it I would pass the message.</p>
