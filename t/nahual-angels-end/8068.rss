    <description>This is 8 sessions of Miguel Angel Espinoza&#39;s Powered by the Apocalypse game of angeleros--angel hunters-- who fight back against the powerful angels brought to Mexico by the conquistadors. It is scheduled for Tuesday nights in July and August at 8 PM US Eastern Time, starting the second week in July.

Content: This is a post-colonial urban fantasy game about resistance to the ongoing legacy of colonial violence in Mexio. It contains dark content, including violence, blood, death and political control. Though the characters will be fighting back against this darkness, they may be challenged by questions of how far they are willing to go to achieve their ends, and asked to pay a price in order to succeed. **In particular, cannibalism, both as a metaphor for colonial power and as a critique of the meat industry, is a core theme of the game. The blood, flesh and bones of angels have powerful magical properties when consumed, your angeleros will run a business that sells them.**

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. All-Access time is 12:00 PM US Eastern May 4, 2022. A seat is saved for Rich Rogers.

We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links and resources. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), as well as Script Change for safety tools.
