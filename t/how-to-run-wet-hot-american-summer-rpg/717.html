          <p>I tried posting this on r/rpg a while back but didn’t get any response. Not sure if I’ll have any more luck here or not, but it’s worth a shot.</p>
<p>I kickstarted Wet Hot American Summer last year and have read it several times, with a plan to run it for some friends who don’t have much experience with role-playing games but absolutely love the movie and TV series. The problem is, for some reason, I just cannot grok what my role actually is or how the game works. I get how things are structured in terms of the day being broken apart but the game is so light on actual mechanics that I feel lost. And it is not that I am new to running role-playing games. I have a lot of experience running Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition, Dungeon World, Monster of the week, and a few others. And I have read through many more, a lot of them PBTA games but not all. And I’m not sure I’ve ever had this problem before where I just cannot wrap my head around how the game actually works in play.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any thoughts? I’m particularly interested in hearing from people who have run or at least played the game. My friends that I was going to run it for have been bugging me since it’s been like a year now and I really am excited to give it a shot. I just want to make sure that I actually do a good job and then I have a handle on what my role is, what the players’ roles are, and the actual mechanics of the game. I did watch an actual play video on YouTube from the game’s creators, but frankly it didn’t help much.</p>

          <p>Hmm, the fact that the game was designed by comedians, only one of whom had previous experience with RPG design (and that was on a game that seems to exist just for laughs), it may simply be that the game isn’t particularly well-designed. The Kickstarter, for instance, didn’t seem to communicate any of the mechanics whatsoever.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I think that seems like a fair assessment, unfortunately. I got the impression from the actual play video that it’s more a (very, very loose) structure for improvisation than an actual game. Which is … fine, I guess. It is what it is. But not something I’m particularly stoked about trying to run. I’m afraid this is just going to be a novelty item on my RPG shelf, and I’d rather that not be the case, you know?</p>
