    <description>*The Kalduhr is a vast and dangerous forest grown over the ruins of civilizations stretching back millenia. The most storied of these civilizations—though certainly not the oldest—is known as Old Kalduhr. Every treasure-hunter has heard of the ancient Kalduhri people. They know somewhere in the forest are the ruins of an ancient city. Searching the deep wood for these ruins requires a desperation or an arrogance to match the Old Kalduhri people. Roots of Old Kalduhr is a mega-incursion. Unlike regular incursions, there is no way a group of treasure-hunters can explore the entirety of it in one attempt—it is too vast, and must be explored again and again, perhaps with the same treasure-hunters who have survived to tell of the place, or perhaps with new treasure-hunters who have discovered it for themselves.*

I am running a **Open Table / West Marches** Game of the Trophy Gold Megadungeon. The few first sessions have been lots of fun.

New players are always welcome. Each session is a one-shot incursion into the dungeon. No prior Trophy (Gold) experience needed. There will be a Discord Server for those players who want to interact with others exploring the megadungeon.

**Setting / Genre:** Dark/Grim Fantasy
These events are scheduled to run for 2.5 hours. No recording is planned.

I am posting 4 sessions in total for now. It’s fine to attend only one or some of the sessions. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools Open Door, Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card) will be in use.

**Content Notice** for the whole megadungeon from the Trophy Gold book: Abandonment, Amputation, Body Horror, Cannibalism, Classism, Confined Spaces, Graphic Violence, Harm to Animals, Harm to Children, Heights, Human Sacrifice, Insects &amp; Spiders, Manipulation, Mannequins, Memory Loss, Mental Illness, Religion, Slavery, Snakes
