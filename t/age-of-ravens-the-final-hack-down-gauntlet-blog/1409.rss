    <description>Today on the blog I wrap up a trilogy of post on lazy rpg hacks (and the people who love them). I focus on  what started as a reskin but has evolved to become something stronger and more interesting: *Changeling the Lost PbtA*. 

[Age of Ravens: The Final Hack-down](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-the-final-hack-down)

Ctl PbtA was first time I had something I knew I absolutely wanted to try out and play on the Gauntlet. I worried about it, but then I posted the sessions to give myself a deadline. The first version ran like a junker car, but we&#39;ve rebuilt the engine over time. I have to thank @patrickK and @Tylom especially for their input, with the latter running it several times. @Auzumel_S, of course deserves co-credit for the whole thing since she focused the ideas and organized rewriting the playbooks. I also have to thank @RichRogers for being enthusiastic about it, since he&#39;s one of my PbtA mentors. 

My point in the post, besides showing off something I&#39;m proud of, is to showcase how much The Gauntlet has helped me. I&#39;m certain this thing wouldn&#39;t exist without this community.</description>
