    <title>Unincorporated: Witchy Little Town (2-shot in February)</title>

    <description>There’s something in the air, a sense of change on its way. Are those flowers blooming under the snow? Whatever it is, the world feels alive and shimmering with power.

This is a  **two-shot**  of [ **Unincorporated** ](https://bethanyharvey.itch.io/unincorporated), by Bethany Harvey.  **Unincorporated**  is a mostly GM-less collaborative story game. We’ll be using the [Weird Little Town](https://bethanyharvey.itch.io/weird-little-town) playset with just a few changes inspired by  *The Craft, Practical Magic, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Sabrina*  (with or without the  *Chilling Adventures* ) and other small town stories about witches living their lives and handling what the world throws at them, which might include petty drama, long-held grudges, hopeless love affairs, and whatnot.

The game will be played via  **Streamyard**  (video optional) and recorded if all players consent. No familiarity with the game is required as rules will be taught! Sessions will run for  **3 hours**  with 5-10 minute breaks at the hour. Attendance at both sessions is highly recommended but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 


Romance may be a part of the game, but we will calibrate tone and subject matter at the table. Look for an email approximately a week before the session!

**Lines &amp; Veils** ,  **Script Change** ,  **X Card** , and the  **Open Door policy**  will be the safety tools in use and this game will be run in accordance with the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html). 

RSVP Open Access Time: January 18, 10:30 am (GMT -8)
