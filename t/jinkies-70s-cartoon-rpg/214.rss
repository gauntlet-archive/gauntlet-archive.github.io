I&#39;m running a session of Jinkies!, a PbtA game of Scooby Doo-esque hijinks! This game is about 3-4 hours and will be recorded/streamed. It&#39;s a one-shot session.

Jinkies! is a comedy/mystery adventure game in which you play a crew of zany teenagers solving mysteries while traveling around in your mystery van! Set in a fictional 1970&#39;s, Jinkies! is reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons where anything can happen, until you pull the mask off the ghost and find Old Man Jenkins was up to no good after all! 

This game is now open to anyone-- and author Toby Strauss has agreed to host a second table! There is plenty of room!
