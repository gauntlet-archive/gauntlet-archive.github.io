    <title>2400: ZONE (postponed, new dates tbd)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/2400-zone-postponed-new-dates-tbd/8638</link>
    <description>**Didn&#39;t think this one through and hit a big scheduling conflict. Still keen to run this so will come back to reschedule in a month or so.** 

NO ONE KNOWS WHAT CAUSED THE EVENT. Alien visitors? Collision with another dimension? Whatever it was, it sundered an area on Earth from the laws of nature. And it left wonders behind. Authorised expeditions are rare, but there are plenty of willing buyers for black market salvage if you’re willing to break the quarantine. Be careful, though: Come back not-quite-human, and the Lab will insist you visit indefinitely. 

ZONE is a rules-light, improvisational scifi game by Jason Tocci about a once-ordinary landscape where the laws of physics no longer apply, inspired by stories like Roadside Picnic and the Southern Reach Trilogy. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. 

I don’t think there are any specific subject matter warnings for this game. A tone of pervasive creepiness and wonder. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door. The game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct

Please sign up for all sessions you want to attend, but sessions will be pretty episodic so it&#39;s fine to drop in and out.</description>
