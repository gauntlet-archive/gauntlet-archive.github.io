          <p>I present to you the <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/01/12/crowdfunding-collection-129/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>new Crowdfunding Collection #129, including every tabletop rpg project started between 01/05 and 01/12</b></a>.</p>
<p><b>Liberté</b> started its second, this time round likely successful, attempt at funding the translation of the French PbtA game. The game focusses on essentially lost children in a world devoid of adults under a constant rain. The setting is quite interesting, it looks cool and I recommend having a look at it. Have I had more money, I’d back it. If you would prefer a low fantasy game, check out <b>The Hero’s Journal</b>. It orients itself at the classic of the genre, looks nice and combines an OSR system with modern elements. Then there’s <b>Glitch</b>, which I too would describe as fantasy. You’ll play gods who went full amageddon on the world and then noticed it was a flawed action. Now they got to do some investigative stuff and fix things. The setting approach is quite unique and the  system is interesting. I’ll be having a closer look at it later. Though, if your like your fantasy steamy, err steampunk, take a look at <b>Mighty Tiny: Tales of the Old Empires</b>. The game is based on the comics of Ben Dunn and offers a setting and system that’s compatible with Savage Worlds and D&amp;D 5E. Last but not least take a look at the <b>Hexagon</b> system. I do actually like the idea of putting the rules on a bunch of character sheets, which looks great.<br>
Then there are two gangster rpgs. There is <b>Mafia Caporegime</b> , offering a totally new game. The characters aim to claim the title of caporegime and thus upturn the local mob. Something which will be supported by their background. The game offers 7 character classes and an entry level adventure. I do would like to have had some more infos about the rules, and asked for them, yet did back it. I think it’s worth having a look. The twist of <b>CAPERS RPG</b> is that the players play superpowered gangsters during the prohibition. I already backed the card based system in a previous project, and do feel tempted to get this deluxe edition too.<br>
If you rather have a good old, well new, game book, take a look at <b>Ghost Ops – Operation Lone Wolf</b>. Then there is the <b>Dungeon Party</b> hybrid rpg. Hybrid, because I didn’t really see the rpg aspect in what appears to be a straight fantasy themed social card game.<br>
There are of course other cool projects like the <b>Blood Floats in Space</b> setting for the Mothership RPG, which caught my eyes with its interesting illustration. The sourcebook <b>The Forgotten Rites of the Moldering Dead </b>for DCC focuses on death, dying, rituals, the undead and more. Which is why I do strongly consider backing it. Another cool thing is the <b>Fungi Fight for Freedom Adventure</b> where you play mushroomy adventures who fight for their freedom. Well, and there a cool, little, handcrafted leather maps to be found in the <b>MeepleCraft Mini Maps</b> project.<br>
You find all those and more projects here:</p>
