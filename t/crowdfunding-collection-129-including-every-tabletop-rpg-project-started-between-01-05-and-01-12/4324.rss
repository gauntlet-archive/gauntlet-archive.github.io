    <description>I present to you the &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/01/12/crowdfunding-collection-129/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;new Crowdfunding Collection #129, including every tabletop rpg project started between 01/05 and 01/12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Liberté&lt;/b&gt; started its second, this time round likely successful, attempt at funding the translation of the French PbtA game. The game focusses on essentially lost children in a world devoid of adults under a constant rain. The setting is quite interesting, it looks cool and I recommend having a look at it. Have I had more money, I’d back it. If you would prefer a low fantasy game, check out &lt;b&gt;The Hero’s Journal&lt;/b&gt;. It orients itself at the classic of the genre, looks nice and combines an OSR system with modern elements. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Glitch&lt;/b&gt;, which I too would describe as fantasy. You’ll play gods who went full amageddon on the world and then noticed it was a flawed action. Now they got to do some investigative stuff and fix things. The setting approach is quite unique and the  system is interesting. I’ll be having a closer look at it later. Though, if your like your fantasy steamy, err steampunk, take a look at &lt;b&gt;Mighty Tiny: Tales of the Old Empires&lt;/b&gt;. The game is based on the comics of Ben Dunn and offers a setting and system that’s compatible with Savage Worlds and D&amp;D 5E. Last but not least take a look at the &lt;b&gt;Hexagon&lt;/b&gt; system. I do actually like the idea of putting the rules on a bunch of character sheets, which looks great.
Then there are two gangster rpgs. There is &lt;b&gt;Mafia Caporegime&lt;/b&gt; , offering a totally new game. The characters aim to claim the title of caporegime and thus upturn the local mob. Something which will be supported by their background. The game offers 7 character classes and an entry level adventure. I do would like to have had some more infos about the rules, and asked for them, yet did back it. I think it’s worth having a look. The twist of &lt;b&gt;CAPERS RPG&lt;/b&gt; is that the players play superpowered gangsters during the prohibition. I already backed the card based system in a previous project, and do feel tempted to get this deluxe edition too.
If you rather have a good old, well new, game book, take a look at &lt;b&gt;Ghost Ops – Operation Lone Wolf&lt;/b&gt;. Then there is the &lt;b&gt;Dungeon Party&lt;/b&gt; hybrid rpg. Hybrid, because I didn’t really see the rpg aspect in what appears to be a straight fantasy themed social card game.
There are of course other cool projects like the &lt;b&gt;Blood Floats in Space&lt;/b&gt; setting for the Mothership RPG, which caught my eyes with its interesting illustration. The sourcebook &lt;b&gt;The Forgotten Rites of the Moldering Dead &lt;/b&gt;for DCC focuses on death, dying, rituals, the undead and more. Which is why I do strongly consider backing it. Another cool thing is the &lt;b&gt;Fungi Fight for Freedom Adventure&lt;/b&gt; where you play mushroomy adventures who fight for their freedom. Well, and there a cool, little, handcrafted leather maps to be found in the &lt;b&gt;MeepleCraft Mini Maps&lt;/b&gt; project.
You find all those and more projects here:
