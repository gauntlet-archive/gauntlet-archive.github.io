# WANTED: BOUNTY HUNTERS. NO QUESTIONS. NO DISINTEGRATIONS. APPLY NOW.

## **Bounty hunting is a complicated and dangerous profession. If you perform well and you&#39;re smart, you can make a profitable living, for a while.**

Inspired by The Mandalorian TV series from Disney+ !
![](upload://2WVCDDBv9TAr7eEpWNSvg54gTYg.gif)

You’re a bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe, post *Return of the Jedi* timeline. You and your companions use tracking fobs and grit to hunt and turn in bounties for credits against the backdrop of the War, collapse of the Empire, and your own personal battles.

This game will use a hack of Monster of the Week (Powered by the Apocalypse) tweaked and made gorgeous by David Miessler-Kubanek

*A seat has been reserved for David MK.*

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded and shared assuming all parties agree. We&#39;ll be using Zoom for web conferencing.

There will be 4 sessions in total. Being able to attend all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

**Content Warnings** - Violence. Imperial Oppression. Likely loss of limbs. Star Warsy swear words. If this were a movie, it&#39;d be PG-13.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools Lines and Veils and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use, as well as post-game feedback after each session.
