The all access time for this game is  June 12, 2020 9:00 AM Manila Time (GMT+8)

**This game is a playtest!** You may enjoy the game if you like darker magical girl stories (our theme) and Masks or other PbtA games (this is a hack of Masks and Libreté). Please only sign up if you&#39;re okay with playtesting! I can&#39;t guarantee the game will work as expected, but I will do my best to make the game fun! No previous experience is necessary, the game will be taught as we play.

Each session is scheduled for 3 hours. We will be using Zoom. This session will be recorded, but will only be made public if all players give their consent.

Being able to attend all sessions would be ideal, but is not required! You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. I will send a confirmation email a week ahead of the first session to confirm and with all necessary links, **please reply to confirm your attendance.**

**DOOMSDAY DEFIANT: Our Dystopia is inspired by Magical Girl anime, a genre that focuses on relationships and the eternal struggle against evil. In this game we ask: how will you hold on to your magic in the face of despair?**

**We will create our characters and the doomsday that comes. Play as Reincarnated Soldiers of magic in a previous life, who must now face their karmic legacy and destiny. An ancient evil has awakened, and the entire world stands on the brink of disaster. Other Reincarnated Soldiers have fallen to the evil, breaking apart and revealing a heart blackened by despair. They are now Witches of the Black.**

**Each Reincarnated Soldier now taps into an arcanic form of deep magic, supported by the eternal mysteries of the tarot. But will this power be enough? Can the soldiers’ hearts hold out, or will they succumb to their darker emotions? Will the ancient evil stirring in their souls awaken? Will their love for each other seem them through? We play to find out.**

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.

**Touchstones** : Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Sailor Moon.

Content Warning: Themes of corruption, tragedy, despair, apocalyptic themes. It is quite likely that the characters will still lose, despite their best efforts. (Certain cards drawn will trigger an end state before the characters are completely ready)

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game is run as part of the Gauntlet gaming community and adheres to the [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
