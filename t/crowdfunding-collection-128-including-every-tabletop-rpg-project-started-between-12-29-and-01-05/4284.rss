    <description>I present to you the new [&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #128, including every tabletop rpg project started between 12/29 and 01/05&lt;/b&gt;](https://teylen.blog/2020/01/06/crowdfunding-collection-128/).

The new year starts with about 18 projects, let’s get to ‚em.
&lt;b&gt;
Last Fleet RPG&lt;/b&gt; is a Powered by the Apocalypse games that offers a science fiction setting that appears to be focused on action. hinweisen.The playbooks are based on the (western) horoscope and considering that my sign (Taurus) fits about my kind of characters a 100 percent to the nail, I couldn’t resist! I supported other projects by the creators like Bite Marks and do consider them trustworthy. Take a look at it. The there is &lt;b&gt;Casting the Runes&lt;/b&gt; is based on the Gumshoe system which approaches the story by M.R. James and offers investigations of ghostly apperitions and other supernatural mysteries. Set in the Eduardian era I consider the take on horror a quite refreshing change from the lovecraftian standard and recommend checking the project. &lt;b&gt;Home&lt;/b&gt; offers a science fantasy setting that pitches humanity against mutated animals. Sadly, the project is a bit scant on informations.
In regards to other projects, &lt;b&gt;Denoa&lt;/b&gt; offers a colorful and interesting looking setting for D&amp;D 5E. If  you are more looking for D&amp;D 5E adventures, &lt;b&gt;A System-Neutral TTRPG Adventure&lt;/b&gt; offers you the opportunity to add some personal input, &lt;b&gt;The Folio: Black Label #3&lt;/b&gt; impresses with opulent graphics and maps and if you want some lovecraftesque horror, you should look at &lt;b&gt;A One-shot Mystery Adventure&lt;/b&gt;. If you are more on the lookout for a container for your cards, you might like to check out the &lt;b&gt;Custom Wooden Card Game Deck Boxes&lt;/b&gt; – they look create.
There are more cool projects. As usual, you’ll find them here::
