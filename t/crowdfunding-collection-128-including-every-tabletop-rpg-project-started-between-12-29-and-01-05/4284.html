<p>The new year starts with about 18 projects, let’s get to ‚em.<br>
<b><br>
Last Fleet RPG</b> is a Powered by the Apocalypse games that offers a science fiction setting that appears to be focused on action. hinweisen.The playbooks are based on the (western) horoscope and considering that my sign (Taurus) fits about my kind of characters a 100 percent to the nail, I couldn’t resist! I supported other projects by the creators like Bite Marks and do consider them trustworthy. Take a look at it. The there is <b>Casting the Runes</b> is based on the Gumshoe system which approaches the story by M.R. James and offers investigations of ghostly apperitions and other supernatural mysteries. Set in the Eduardian era I consider the take on horror a quite refreshing change from the lovecraftian standard and recommend checking the project. <b>Home</b> offers a science fantasy setting that pitches humanity against mutated animals. Sadly, the project is a bit scant on informations.<br>
In regards to other projects, <b>Denoa</b> offers a colorful and interesting looking setting for D&amp;D 5E. If  you are more looking for D&amp;D 5E adventures, <b>A System-Neutral TTRPG Adventure</b> offers you the opportunity to add some personal input, <b>The Folio: Black Label <span class="hashtag">#3</span></b> impresses with opulent graphics and maps and if you want some lovecraftesque horror, you should look at <b>A One-shot Mystery Adventure</b>. If you are more on the lookout for a container for your cards, you might like to check out the <b>Custom Wooden Card Game Deck Boxes</b> – they look create.<br>
There are more cool projects. As usual, you’ll find them here::</p>
<p><b>English Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>3 Role-Playing Games<br>
1 Setting<br>
3 Adventures<br>
2 Dice Project<br>
1 Deck of Cards<br>
1 Card Box<br>
1 D&amp;D Character Sheet<br>
3 Artworks<br>
1 Counter<br>
1 Anthology</p>
<p><b>German Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>1 Role-Playing Game</p>
