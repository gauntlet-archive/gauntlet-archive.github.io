    <title>Two-sentence Dungeon World one-shot</title>

    <description>Today I saw a rumour tweeted by [@randomdnd](http://twitter.com/randomdnd), and immediately thought it would make a fantastic stepping off for a single session of **Dungeon World**:

&gt; You lose her near a desolate prison flooded with giant chuul. The hag said that the Dream Shard of Death was fought here. #dnd

*What are you doing?*

From here, you can extrapolate the ambiguities in the hook to generate some compost for the game.  If you have a D6 closer to hand than a playgroup, use these instead:

#### Who is *she*?

- 1-3: a master ironmonger 
- 4-5: the hag
- 6: a pregnant duchess

#### Lose her?

- 1-3: Lost her trail
- 4-5: Escaped her chase 
- 6: She died

#### What caused the desolation?

- 1-3: Dragonfire
- 4-5: Plague
- 6: Geostationary comet

#### Who was imprisoned?

- 1-3: War criminals 
- 4-5: Heretic scholars
- 6: A nascent godling

#### The hag?

- 1-3: Grendeldam, mother of trolls
- 4-5: An accursed warlock
- 6: Terrestrial boneless lamprey

#### The Dream Shard of Death?

- 1-3: A sentient glaive 
- 4-5: An historic troupe of would-be heroes
- 6: A gestalt anthropocorpus

#### Fought...

- 1-3: And slain
- 4-5: And fled 
- 6: But never bested

### Do you have some grim portents?

No.

Just use a couple of small *clocks* and extrapolate from whichever thread isn&#39;t being directly addressed right now.</description>
