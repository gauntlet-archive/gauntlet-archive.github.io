    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/01/12/crowdfunding-collection-157/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #157, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/29 and 01/12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Happy New Year! Following another long break, I am back with a fresh and illustrated collection.
I still remain at the clinic, yet finally could free some time and had the energy to go back to it. Sadly, a lot of projects have been started and ended between the last and this collection. I mentioned the ended projects I am aware off, at the end of the illustrated „live projects list“.

Considering there are currently 77 projects live, 19 English ttrpgs, I will keep the prologe to a few projects that caught my eye. Which enables me to get the list out today, and not at Sunday when likely a ton of new „make 100“ projects have been started.

I personally backed the &lt;b&gt;The Monsters Are Our Heroes Print Tabletop RPG Zine&lt;/b&gt;. It offers a neat little game, in which I can play a Vampire ~ or a different monster ~ at a rather nice backer level and it looks like it is made with enthusiasm. Check it out. Then my eye caught the game &lt;b&gt;Those Who Wander&lt;/b&gt;. While I am not such a big fan of „fantasy“ games, the inclusive approach to character creation caught my eye. As did the colorful cover of &lt;b&gt;Space Aces: TNG (The New Guidebook).&lt;/b&gt; Which is a neat, little science fiction game. I am as well tempted to back the gamebook &lt;b&gt;Alba – an Open World Adventure Book&lt;/b&gt;. It’s presentation is interesting, and the additional material is rad, maybe I’ll back it later on.
Fans of the Powered by the Apocalypse system should check out &lt;b&gt;Babes in the Wood RPG&lt;/b&gt;, a game about having halloween themed adventures for kids, and/or &lt;b&gt;ABYSS&lt;/b&gt; which rather induldges in supernatural Action-Horror ala Castlevania or Hellsing. &lt;b&gt;Rune and Steel&lt;/b&gt; mostly caught my eye, as it kind of looks like the German tabletop rpg juggernaut The Dark Eye, though I haven’t delved deeper.

You find those and a great many more, cool, worthy, projects here:
