The destruction of the Death Star and the murder of Emperor Palpatine by those terrorist rebels was an utter shock. They came swarming like rabid mynocks for your home, your friends and family, your whole way of life. The Empire is falling. You are the last order of the Empire. You must escape the deplorable &quot;New Republic&quot; on... the  ***Last Imperial Fleet*** .

As the last Imperial remnants are fleeing across space, pursued by the New Republic, an implacable terrorist force that destroyed their civilization. You’re outnumbered and outgunned. Supplies are running low. New Republic spies undermine the fleet from within. The actions of a brave few souls are all that stands between the fleet and extinction.

*Last Fleet*  is a tabletop roleplaying game where you play courageous pilots, officers, engineers, politicians and journalists struggling to hold their law and order – and themselves – together under unbelievable pressure. The game focuses on action, intrigue, and drama in this high-stakes situation. You’ll fight space battles, search for enemy infiltrators, and navigate faction politics. You’ll strive against your own self-doubt and sometimes crack under the stress.

**In this game series, I&#39;d like to explore the idea of an Imperial Last Fleet. Your characters grew up under the fascist control of the Empire, but is that all that there is? We&#39;ll be using a bevy of safety tools and I have no interest in lauding an Imperial society. But I do want to explore it, with this game as a vehicle. If you&#39;re interested in giving this a try with me, sign up.**
