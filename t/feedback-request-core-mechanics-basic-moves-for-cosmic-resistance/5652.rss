    <title>Feedback Request: Core Mechanics &amp; Basic Moves for Cosmic Resistance</title>

    <description>Hi All,

I&#39;m designing a science fantasy PbtA game about saving an imperiled universe where magic is possible. I&#39;d appreciate thoughts on how my basic moves are written (pg 4) and on my quirk for the dice (pg 5).

[Here are the relevant pages from my Quickstart Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YiT9nrUbkIpjrEtvWVk_PV9CxEZgeg3s/view?usp=sharing).

Inspirations include Guardians of the Galaxy, Mass Effect, Star Wars, and the Saga comics. FWIW, I&#39;ve been posting a bit on reddit (ex. [on the dice quirk](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/g4x25a/cosmic_resistance_my_dice_mechanic_and_a_game/)).

Thanks for taking the time to look at my game!

EDIT: Starting another round of playtests today, and did some big revisions after reading Fellowship this weekend. Thanks to everyone who looked at this. I might post again later. 

EDIT 2: Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to bump this. Thought I could just edit quietly in case anyone came late and decided to give feedback on material that&#39;s out of date.</description>
