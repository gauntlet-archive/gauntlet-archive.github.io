    <description>**SMASHBALL**
![](upload://ecdJlg07vkchp7n5r1qc6t4Khlj.png)

### **The extreme sports space opera you never knew you needed is finally here.**

*The roar of the holocrowd is overpowering. The weight of the ball in your hands isn’t nearly as heavy*

*as the fate of your Colony on your shoulders. The smell of burnt duracrete fills the recycled air*

*as your gravskates crackle to life.* 

-----------------------------------

After the fall of the Empire and the great exodus of the nobles to the Core Worlds, the six colonies of [Eliad ](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Eliad)adopted a cultural imperative of pacifism.

Aboard the specially-configured arenaship Ersatz, the colonies’ chosen representatives mediate their conflicts through a tournament of champions playing the sport of Smashball.

The smashballers of the Ersatz League are the pinnacle of athleticism: from the humble dust groves of the Sixth Colony to the radiant spires of the First, they are sequestered on the Ersatz in perpetual, glorious competition.

-----------------------------------

I&#39;ve reskinned the RPG [Arkball ](https://nuclearobelisk.itch.io/arkball-core)to Star Wars for a two-shot.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and will be added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

**CW:** Violence, Imperial power abuse, desolation, and loss
**System**  : Arkball
**Duration**  : Two 3 hour sessions
**Breaks**  : 1 mid-point break per session (10 mins)
**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Attendance**  : Joining both sessions is recommended. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.
