PLEASE NOTE: This game is a playtest. Please only sign up if you are interested in play testing an unreleased game.

The children of oil barons and fading nobility smile and shake hands on the football field, while conspiring to poison each other behind closed doors. Debauched parties give way to mystery cults, and at the edge of the quad a massive shape watches from afar, hungering for blood…

In the world of  ***Midnight Oil*** , we will play as students attending a prestigious university somewhere in the US or UK. We are overachievers, aspiring lawyers, sorority girls, party animals, and brooding loners. Unbeknownst to us, our destinies are entangled — it will not take long before we fall in love, turn against one another, hurt each other, and get lost in the darkness. All under the supervising eyes of the forces that seek to control us. Perhaps it’s the notebook with thoughts on how to bring your dead girlfriend back to life, or the enormous beast waiting for you to fall asleep, or maybe the portrait in your closet that grows older while you stay young. We are all controlled and swayed by the horrors of a broken world.

We are the young gods, destined to die an early death in the most brutal and wicked ways. Given that, let’s go out on a high note.

**Content Notes:**  Contains (both explicit and implicit) references to addiction, drug use, self-harm, queerphobia, colonialism, suicide, and assault. Additionally, this is a messy and at times painful game. It contains interactions between characters that blur the line between love and hatred, sex and violence. Characters can be controlling and manipulative, messy and harsh. While this is an early release and thus doesn’t have text around safety, we will use Safety Tools, such as Lines &amp; Veils or the X-Card.

**System:**  Hack of Apocalypse Keys, a PbtA game

**Duration:**  Four 3 hour sessions

**Breaks:**  2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue:**  GM’s Zoom

**Recording:**  Yes, but made public only if consent by all the players

**Attendance:**  Joining all four sessions is ideal but not required

**Safety:**  Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

A seat is saved for Kae. 

I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance.
