    <description>Context: I am working on a PBTA game right now and want to start external playtesting soon. 

Assuming a game is designed enough to play full sessions of, what do you, an experienced RPG player and potential player, need in the packet?

Naturally, Playbooks. What else?</description>

              <p>Oh, also, seconding the idea of providing specific questions. I don’t know what your design intentions are, so I can’t give you good feedback from the rules alone. The game might seem to have gone great to me, but be a complete failure from your POV as a designer. So tell me what you want the game to be like and ask me questions about that; and point me at any mechanics you’re unsure of and want feedback on.</p>

              <p>It depends, as others have said. On the assumption that you essentially want me to play the complete game, rather than test some particular subsystem (which I think is a completely valid approach, by the way - it’s mostly how I do playtesting):</p>
<ul>
<li>I want the basic moves</li>
<li>I want the playbooks</li>
<li>I want the GM principles and moves, or some indication of how the game should be GM’d</li>
<li>I want a bit of supporting material to explain any elements that won’t be obvious from previous PBTA experience. I’ve picked up a few games where the meaning of a move trigger or principle is opaque and what this means is I can’t use that component of the game at all.</li>
<li>If you want to dramatically increase the chances I’ll find time to playtest it, I want a one-shot scenario or similar material to help me get to the meat of play really quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>(If you’re expecting any of your playtesters to not be PBTA veterans then maybe you need to explain clocks and XP tracks and the dice mechanic and so on - but that’s not me.)</p>

<p>YES!!!<br>
What would I want to see in a <strong>Playtest Packet</strong>?</p>
<ol>
<li>What you want tested? A list of questions about what things to focus on.</li>
<li>Support for exactly what you want tested. If all you want is to test out how the “social resolution” move works. Include that move, and a few scenes or starters where you think that move would get used. Are you testing character creation? Are you testing the MC’s reaction moves? Are you testing a specific playbook? Include what ever I would need to test that bit. “whatever the minimum” is might be a lot bigger than just that item. Testing “Advancement” might mean you have most everything else in play in order for people to have a feeling of when the advancement comes (for pacing) and whether the advancement feels “good”.</li>

</aside>
<p>Maybe. To me, the base thing for PbtA play is not the playbook but the basic moves, and maybe the MC reactions. Principles and Agendas are nice too.</p>
