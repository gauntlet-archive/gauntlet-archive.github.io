    <description>**Game 3 of my Spooktober Saturdays Series**

**The Witch Is Dead by Grant Howitt**  is an RPG about cute little animal familiars seeking bloody murderous revenge on the Witch-Hunter that killed their Witch, and stealing the Witch-Hunter&#39;s eyes to magically bring their Witch back to life. 

**For the first 48 hours please only RSVP if you are not already registered in another one of the Spooktober Saturday games.**

**System:**  A one-page one shot using d10s with simple rules (which will be taught)

**Vibe:**  Comedy-horror

**Content warnings:**  Blood, eye stuff (see the summary above), gore

**Since the players will play animal familiars at risk of harm, there is a strong warning of implied harm to animals (which will be veiled as much as possible).** 

**Breaks:**  On the hour or as required

**Venue:**  Discord

**Recording:**  Only with permission

**Safety Tools:**  Lines and Veils, X-Card, Open Table, Script Change, and any other/additional tools to suit the needs of the players

This event will follow the [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
