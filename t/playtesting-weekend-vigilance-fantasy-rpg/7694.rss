    <description>Part man. Part myth. All Law.

Inspired by mythology and Robocop, Vigilance is an RPG about Living Laws in a Post-Bronze Age Collapsed Fantasy World.

Pregenerated characters and their province will be supplied.

**Note:** Playtesting of resolution mechanics—looking for testers who understand dice pools and probability.

This event is scheduled to run for 2 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
