    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/alternative-to-dungeon-world/5497</link>
    <description>Hi! What game would you recommend as an alternative to Dungeon World?

I&#39;m looking for a game with &quot;traditional&quot; classes, to just trow at my D&amp;D friends when we are together and want to play a session. What would be a good PbtA for this? Or should I go OSR?

I wanted to try DW for the past year, but right now I don&#39;t like the idea of supporting Adam Koebel

Thanks!</description>

              <p>I would echo many of the other suggestions but I would also add Barbarians of Lemuria for a fun 2d6 system OSR.  It is swords and sorcery…so not exactly D&amp;D equivalent and 3 variations of difficulty.  I prefer the Legendary version to the newest.  The newest is more like D&amp;D 5e than OSR rules.</p>

              <p>Shadow of the Demon Lord is a simple “oldschool RPG but with modern design principles” system designed for very fast character creation with deep customization options as you level up (and is intended for short adventures and short campaigns). It’s got cool stuff if you’re into its darker tone.</p>

              <p>You could try something vintage and lightweight like the Advanced Fighting Fantasy. There is a V2 that came out recently. It was interesting to look at again recently because I discovered its a bit like DW, in that you let the players describe their actions some combat feels more loose and narrative driven. The basic D6 rules also align a little but are opposed rolls.</p>
<p>I did a review of the 1st edition from 1989 with some actual walk-through play at the end of the video for a flavour of the combat, however I hear good things about the v2 which is still in print. I now own V2 so I need to get another video organised of the gameplay.<br>

<p>For PbtA I’d push for Freebooters, but if you ARE interested in OSR, these days I’d suggest playing around with Maze Rats, Knave, The Black Hack, Troika! and Into The Odd. I’m a huge fan of Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland, if the setting is your kind of thing. I also think it does a really great job of providing that perfect balance between problem solving, exploration and character growth so many games strive at; it’s also <em>so much easier</em> to learn than most games these days.</p>

              <p>I can say that, with close to 100 sessions under belt (both playing and running) DW-adjacent games that use advantage instead of +1 forward, that there have been no shortages of misses, and definitely no shortages of 7-9 results pushing the stories.</p>
<p>Yes, advantage is a significant boost. When you’re starting with a +0 or +1 modifier, it’s closer to a +2 than a +1. It’s more like a +1 than a +2 when you start off at +2 or +3 in the first place.  And in most cases, doesn’t hugely alter the frequency of 7-9 results, which IMO is the result that tends to make most PbtA games hum.</p>
<p>Reasons I like advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t stack, so you don’t have to worry about accumulations of +1 from here and +1 from there</li>
<li>Failure is always at least a little possible</li>
<li>It’s very clear whether a +1 bonus only actually affected a roll, and only ~1 in 4 rolls are actually affected. So more often than not, it feels like that +1 modifier you got “didn’t matter.”</li>
<li>It’s much less clear whether advantage affected any given roll (even if you roll a special die, it still feels like it <em>might</em> have mattered. Thus, advantage <em>feels</em> like more of a boost.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>World of Dungeons</em> is a game some people really enjoy, as well, although it’s much lighter in structure.</p>
<p>Another fun alternative is <em>Red Box Hack</em> (more whimsical) or <em>Old School Hack</em> (more structured, more polished, more standard fantasy) - one game is a variant of the other, and both are free. I prefer a lot of things about Red Box Hack, but Old School Hack has more of the traditional D&amp;D thing going on.</p>

              <p>Freebooters is one of my favorite games currently. I’ve always put it that where DW suffers by trying to be both PbtA <em>and</em> D&amp;D, Freebooters succeeds by learning harder into the (O)D&amp;Disms and subsequently manages to do both parts better.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t know if I would recommend it as good for just throwing at players when they want to play a session–it’s pretty explicitly built for campaign play imo, and has a pretty involved collaborative world generation process.</p>
<p>For something that’s quick to the table, I’d also recommend One-Shot World or, my current go-to, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oLQ6QUT9LgOZuzoB_YqUaCjfPGYEOlud/view" rel="nofollow noopener">Homebrew World</a>. Both are great and both are free, so I’d recommend looking them over and seeing which feels like a better fit.</p>

              <p>Hi! What game would you recommend as an alternative to Dungeon World?</p>
<p>I’m looking for a game with “traditional” classes, to just trow at my D&amp;D friends when we are together and want to play a session. What would be a good PbtA for this? Or should I go OSR?</p>
<p>I wanted to try DW for the past year, but right now I don’t like the idea of supporting Adam Koebel</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
