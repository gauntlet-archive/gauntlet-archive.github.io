In the Outer Rim, your crew of troubleshooters, mercenaries and freebooters have to make credits to pay the bills... and to have a hope to someday retire to some nice agri-colony (or whatever).

Yoshigawa Corporation has issued a call to recover a shipment of lost cargo. The cargo went down over a hostile planet in the Outer Rim.

Grab your kit, and saddle up. Paydays this big don&#39;t come around every day. Get this bond sorted, get paid, and get home in time to watch the podracing championship. What could go wrong?

-----------------------------------
Offworlders is a science fiction roleplaying game about adventurers, outlaws, and guns for hire making their fortune on the rough end of the galaxy. It is designed to be straightforward enough to pick up and be ready to play in just a few minutes as a one-off game, but with enough meat to play a short campaign as well. 

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 
Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to [our wiki](https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

**CW: Violence, strong emotional ties.**
**System**  :  *World of Dungeons*
**Duration**  : Two 3 hour sessions
**Breaks**  : 1 mid-point break per session (10 mins)
**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom
**Recording**  : Yes, but made public only if consent by all the players
**Attendance**  : Joining both sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 
**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
