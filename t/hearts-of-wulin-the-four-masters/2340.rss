    <title>Hearts of Wulin - the Four Masters</title>

    <description>Once four wise masters balanced the world. Their wisdom brought harmony for three hundred years. Then the youngest of them grew envious and craved the powers and gifts of the others. In the most hideous betrayal and took the thrones, and their wisdom for his own.

Now his masked warriors enforce their tyrannous rule across the lands - faceless enforcers in a land bereft of hope

The secrets of martial arts and wuxia wisdom are all but lost, but in the margins, and in the dark, there are still heroes who are willing to resist the tyrant.

Perhaps though, not all their motivations are pure and honest.

I would prefer players who can make all four sessions. Games will be recorded – safety tools including the X-Card and Lines and Veils will be used.
