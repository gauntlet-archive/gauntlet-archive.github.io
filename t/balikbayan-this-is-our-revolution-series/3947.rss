This session is scheduled for 4 hours. The session will be recorded if everyone is cool with it! If not, no worries. We will be using Streamyard.

Being able to attend all sessions would be ideal, but is not required! You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Please note [BALIKBAYAN is still in beta](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/balikbayan). BALIKBAYAN uses the Belonging Outside Belonging system. (No Dice, No Masters.)

*It is the far future. Earth has been abandoned for generations. Humanity left for brighter stars, richer planets and shining colonies. To fuel their dreams of a better tomorrow, the humans turned to the Elementals and their magic. This magic is an invaluable source of power and labor. Machines were created to harness and enslave the Elementals .You were one of these Enslaved Elementals. You are machines that echo the legendary magic you once possessed. You and your friends are among the few who have managed to return to Earth. What remains of Earth’s cities is falling apart. The Corp won’t let go of you so easily either. But shining through the cracks is a magic that is ready to be reborn.* ***Can you outrun The Corp long enough and bring forth the Rebirth of magic? Will you survive this revolution you’ve started, or will The Corp recapture you?***

**Content Warnings:** BALIKBAYAN does focus on stories of revolution, themes of oppression and violent capitalism may come up naturally through play.

**Safety Tools** : A combination of the x-card, lines and veils, and script change will be used. The GM is open to using a different set of safety tools if that supports the players best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
