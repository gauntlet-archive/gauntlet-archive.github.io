    <description>This is a quarterly series of Vincent and Meguey Baker&#39;s Under Hollow Hills, a game of fae performers putting on a circus for fairy and human folk across and between worlds. The game will be played at 8 PM eastern time Tuesdays in March, April and May of 2021. All access sign up begins 2/4/2021 at 9 AM Eastern

This game will explore themes of otherness, beauty, terror, the uncanny, the lies underneath our stories, and the truth we can tell with lies. Key cultural touchstones include A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, *Litte, Big* by John Crowley, Neil Gaiman&#39;s *The Sandman* and as many fairy tales undomesticated by the Grimms and Perrault as I can muster. It may confront issues of violence, sexuality, the inhumanity of humans and the humaneness of the inhuman.

Sign up is currently for the first 9 sessions. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Players in the beginning of the series will have priority to sign up for the May sessions.

I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Rules will be taught. Sessions will run up to three and a half hours. The game will be run over Streamyard We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils, script change and the X-Card for safety tools. A spot is being saved for Dan B.

              <p>This is the final 3 sessions of a quarterly series of Vincent and Meguey Baker’s Under Hollow Hills, a game of fae performers putting on a circus for fairy and human folk across and between worlds. The game will be played at 8 PM eastern time Tuesdays in March, April and May of 2021. All access time is waived, anybody may sign up immediately.</p>
<p>This game will explore themes of otherness, beauty, terror, the uncanny, the lies underneath our stories, and the truth we can tell with lies. Key cultural touchstones include A Midsummer Night’s Dream, <em>Litte, Big</em> by John Crowley, Neil Gaiman’s <em>The Sandman</em> and as many fairy tales undomesticated by the Grimms and Perrault as I can muster. It may confront issues of violence, sexuality, the inhumanity of humans and the humaneness of the inhuman.</p>
<p>Sign up is currently for the final 3 sessions.   Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Priority is given to those who played in the earlier sessions, but there is an open slot for a guest in the final session, and games may draw from the waitlist.</p>

              <p>Hey folks, there is an open spot in the rest of this month’s run of Under Hollow Hills, Tuesday nights for the rest of April 8 PM US Eastern time.  NOTE:  This slot also comes with priority sign up for the continuation of the series in May.  It does not require Gauntlet Patreon membership, everybody is welcome.</p>
<p>(There is also a second spot available for this Tuesday’s session, but I can’t promise space in May.  Still, love to have you a special guest star, and you could take number 1 on the waitlist.)</p>
