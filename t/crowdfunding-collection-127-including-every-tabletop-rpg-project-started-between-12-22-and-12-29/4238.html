<p>In the final Collection, that will conclude 2019, you’ll only find six projects. Given the small number, I’ll introduce each of them briefly…</p>
<p><b>Destiny Aurora</b> is a Starfinder based sourcebook or companion book. It expands the Starfinder universe with the setting from the comic book of the same name. Providing players with new races, various faction to align to or alienate, the option to shape your crew, ship and reputation in the univers while braving various adventures. The setting appears quite interesting, colorful and I recommend having a look. Then there is the stadalone game <b>ADVANCED FANTASY ROLE-PLAYING</b>, which offers a very classic, complex gaming experience. It appears to have been created with quite some love, though not my kind of game.<br>
If you faced the problem that your convention badged ruined a table, you might like to take a look at the <b>Game Convention Lanyard Stabilizer</b>. A clip that helps with freely swinging badges. Then there are the <b>Game Mash Chipboard Monster Tokens</b>, which offer precisely what the name says. Tokens to use during games.<br>
If you speak or understand Spanish you might like to take a look at <b>Vendha</b>. The first book of a three part Spanish book series. If you like to have a key chain that combines Alpacas and gaming, you might like to check out the French project <b>Les alporte clés du rôliste</b>.<br>
You’ll find all projects mentioned over here:</p>
<p><b>English Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>1 Role-Playing Game<br>
1 Sourcebook<br>
1 Accessoire<br>
1 Token</p>
<p><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>1 Gamebook</p>
