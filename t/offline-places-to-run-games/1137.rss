    <title>Offline places to run games</title>

    <description>Hi! I asked this question a few days back, likely in the wrong place, because I&#39;m not sure where it belongs.

Is there, or should there be, a category/topic for people to post opportunities to run games IRL? I know LFP posts are off-limits, but this is not that. I run a convention which tries to be Gauntlet-friendly, and certainly promotes indie games wherever possible. I&#39;d love to be able to invite people to run games at our tables, but don&#39;t want to spam or put promo where it&#39;s not wanted, because I like clean forums.</description>

              <p>I, too, would like to be able to talk about offline games here.</p>
<p>Also: I dislike podcasts so I am likely outside the mainstream Gauntlet Forum member.</p>
