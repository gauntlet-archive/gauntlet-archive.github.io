    <title>Magic inspired Dungeon World?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/magic-inspired-dungeon-world/2337</link>
    <description>Has anyone tried something like this before? Magic cards have nice illustrations and could be an interesting method to randomize setting elements (NPCs, locations, magic objects) for a multiplanar fantasy campaign. I think I&#39;d use DW for the sake of simplicity, but other games might be possible too.
To be clear, I&#39;m not talking specifically about playing in the Magic universe, but about playing in a Magic inspired game.</description>

              <p>I have used Magic cards for some inspiration, particularly the enchantments, artifacts, and land cards. I also ran a one shot using the Planeshift: Amonkhet supplement put out by Wizards of the Coast for 5e, but just used it as my setting for the game. It worked out well.</p>

<p>I think this kind of oracle can work pretty well - it’s basically the same idea as using tarot cards if you’re good at using tarot cards (which I’m not, despite having accumulated half a dozen decks over the years): You get content-rich inputs that can be interpreted in multiple ways and on multiple levels which fires up your brain to make new connections and feed your inspiration.</p>

<p>The <em>Planar Chaos</em> set is an especially good one to draw images from, since it was a consciously divergent reality - it’d help keep things from drifting too easily to overtly derivative material</p>

<p>I hold forth on using Magic the Gathering cards as creative inspiration for RPGs. Both baseline ideas here were stolen from WotC's mobile app/magazine, Dragon+. It's free; check it out. The referenced card images and full show notes can be found at...</p>

<p>Use a Magic card deck (they were everywhere then!) as an “oracle” you can draw from to improvise monsters, locations, setpieces, and effects.</p>
<p>I don’t think it works all that well, now, but it served me at the time. I suppose it might be possible to design something more functional if you really put some thought into it.</p>

<p>usually i’ve done 5 batches of 5 cards, look over them and see which one inspires a location, plot or npc.</p>
<p>because there are themes in the packs you can insert this into the game, eg if undead show up twice then you link those elements in some way.</p>
