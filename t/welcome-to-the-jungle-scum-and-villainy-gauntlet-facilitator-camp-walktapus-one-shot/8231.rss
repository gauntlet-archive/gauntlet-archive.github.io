*Content warning: aliens, body horror, space horror*

## Unwise deals. Blaster fights. High adventure among the stars.

Your spaceship crew is trying to make ends meet under the iron-fisted rule of the Galactic Hegemony despite powerful criminal syndicates, warring noble families, dangerous aliens, and strange mystics. Can your motley crew hold it together long enough to strike it big and insure your fame across the sector?

In this session, you and your teammates will be given the opportunity to rescue a scientist from a near-fortress on a wilderness jungle planet.

No prior-system knowledge is required and it will be taught during the session. PCs will **work together** to solve problems and help **craft the narrative** . **Taking risks** keeps the story and **combat moving quickly** like an action movie, and the system includes tools to soften extreme consequences. There&#39;s no crunchy combat or hex-maps.

### Tools and safety:


[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.

The Open Door Policy is in place meaning anyone should feel free to leave the game, or cancel as needed.

The session will be played over Zoom with two tools over a web browser: an online dice roller and a Google Sheets document with the characters. The Zoom link will be provided the night before.

There will be breaks on the hour (5-10 minutes).

This session is intended to be recorded, but that will be checked before and after play.

**A check-in email will be sent a day prior which MUST be replied to in order to have confirmed that you&#39;re playing in the game. Otherwise your spot will be offered to the next person on the waitlist.**

*(Normally a reminder email would also be sent one week before the session that you must also reply to, but given that this session was posted the day before, this note is only here to acknowledge the normal Gauntlet Facilitator best practices.)*
