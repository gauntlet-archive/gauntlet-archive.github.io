          <p>I am working on an advancement system and I came across two MOSAIC Strict supplements that kinda clicked with my goals and with each other: <a href="https://theoriginalcockatrice.itch.io/advancement" rel="nofollow noopener">Advancement</a>, by TheOriginalCockatrice, and <a href="https://sabrecat.itch.io/mosaic-strict-experience-and-quests" rel="nofollow noopener">Experience and Quests</a>, by SabreCat.</p>
<p>Here’s the VERY rough draft of joining them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are safe and can recall your journeys roll 2d6 + 1 for each of the below:</p>
<ul>
<li>You grew as a player;</li>
<li>Your PC was challenged;</li>
<li>You and the table had fun;</li>
<li>Your PC loses something great.</li>
<li>Your PC shares something great.</li>
</ul>
<p>10+ Take both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get 1 Major Token</li>
<li>Get 2 Minor Tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>7-9: Take one from above.</p>
<p>6-: Take +1 forward when you make this move again.</p>
<h3>Experience Tokens</h3>
<p>Experience tokens are a currency that players earn for character actions and can spend to improve a character’s situation or standing. You can use physical items like poker chips to represent them in inperson play, or track them as quantities on a character sheet.</p>
<p>Spend a minor experience token to gain a momentary or ephemeral advantage for your character.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an action scene, an opportunity to strike; a convenient distraction; a favorable wind…</li>
<li>If resources are scarce, secure a meal; find a clip of ammunition; earn a few coins…</li>
<li>When interacting socially, a good impression; a contact is reachable; a rumor is believed…</li>
</ul>
<p>A major experience token is a rarer treat that can be spent to gain or cement a permanent resource.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn a new skill, or broaden the scope or intensify the focus of an existing skill. Fantastical characters might develop a new magic spell or cyberspace hacking routine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Obtain a valuable and durable tool, weapon, or piece of equipment; or promote something mundane into a signature item with special properties.</li>
<li>Gain a new friend, ally, or contact; or develop an ongoing relationship into a durable bond.</li>
</ul>
<p>The change so far is minimal, and mostly on the move above. Where I want to take it into a different direction is in the framing.</p>
<p>I would like to call it Change or Growth, as I would like it to focus on personal and interpersonal struggles and the lessons learned, as suggested in a sentence further on A&amp;Q:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quest can instead be intensely personal, an accounting of a character grappling with a decision, responsibility, doubt, or any other facet of life that showcases their development and can be marked with a beginning and end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quest can be personal to a specific character, in which case only that character can earn tokens from it or complete it. A quest can also be shared by the group. For a group quest, anyone can perform one of its beats to earn a minor token, and when you bring the quest to a conclusion together, everyone gets a major token!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a nice and seemingly not too cumbersome system of character change over play.</p>
<p>I would like to know your thoughts and opinions on it.</p>

          <p>This seems cool to me - definitely worth trying. The +1 prompts mix in and out of character stuff in a way that looks really fun; I can think of lots of players who’d really enjoy aiming to lose something great for both the drama and the +1.</p>
<p>One thing that stands out if that if you hit all five prompts, you’d roll the move at 2d6+5, making a miss impossible. In most contexts I’d consider that a problem for a pbta move. Here I don’t think it’s necessarily an issue but would probably still make it +1 for each below to a maximum of +4. But maybe that’s somewhere else in the rules already.</p>
