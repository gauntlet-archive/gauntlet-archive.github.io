    <description>Dark Nation is an RPG that casts the players as ordinary people, living under the control of an oppressive government known as &#39;The System&#39;. When something awful happens, they&#39;re compelled to investigate and will have to find out how much they&#39;re prepared to give up to learn the truth, and what they&#39;re willing to sacrifice for a modicum of justice.
