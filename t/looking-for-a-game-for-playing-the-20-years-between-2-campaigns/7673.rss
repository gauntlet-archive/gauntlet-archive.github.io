    <title>Looking for a game for playing the 20 years between 2 campaigns</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-for-a-game-for-playing-the-20-years-between-2-campaigns/7673</link>
    <description>Hi all, I&#39;ve finished a fantasy campaign (playing Dungeon World) a few months back. We played the end of the campaign using Kingdom, and it was pretty awesome, but, as sometimes happen in Kingdom, we chose the path of hubris and brought the downfall of our kingdom. In the epilogue the PCs dispersed, and one of the main antagonists got his hold on the kingdom. We had a great time, and left the option of coming back to this world and seeing where things would go next.

Now I have a pretty good idea for a continuation, that would use a light reskin of Blades in the Dark to tell the story of the 20 years older PCs coming back to the site of our last campaign, where the antagonist has built a dark techno-alchemo-magical hell city that had spread it&#39;s influence far and wide during the last 20 years. They&#39;ll be the underdogs trying to overthrow him, 20 years after losing to him.

We could just use this and jump right in (well, after I do the reskinning of BitD and feel comfortable with it), but I really want to play something that would give us a taste of the years that passed, new complications and things for the characters to lose. I want them to **feel** much older.

Can anyone point me towards a game that can help us explore something like that?

We are well versed in story games, and played Kingdom, Follow, Microscope, The Quiet Year, Firebrands and more. Is there something you can thing of in that vein that could be tweaked to do this?

My next option is trying to create something. I have some ideas, but I don&#39;t have much (any) experience as a game designer, so I&#39;d rather try and see if there&#39;s anything available that could do what I want.

Thanks!</description>
