    <description>In the latest episode of Fear of a Black Dragon, @Coalhada and I are talking about The Bandits of Bunglewood, an adventure found in Dungeon Magazine #51, originally published in 1995. In the Expert Delve segment, I talk about the changes I made to the module in order to make it more appealing to modern play groups.
