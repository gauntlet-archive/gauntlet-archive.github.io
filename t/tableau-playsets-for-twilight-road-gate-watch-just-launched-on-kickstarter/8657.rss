    <description>**Tableau**  is a new collaborative game system for cinematic storytelling from Dyvers Hands Productions by Christopher Allen.

**Tableau**  is a GMless storytelling system for 2-5 players, played using poker-sized cards featuring rules &amp; inspirational images. Each playset includes everything you need to play except for your own index cards, markers and sheets of paper, and optionally one six-sided dice. The typical playtime is 2-3 hours.

* **Tableau**  helps you create a satisfying cinematic and immersive storytelling experience over the course of just a few hours.
* Together you will build an intriguing &amp; impactful story without the need for advance preparation or a designated gamemaster or narrator.
* The choices of different poker-sized cards offer you ‚Äúcomposable‚Äù rules, giving you a flexible framework to create and control your characters and explore a range of story genres and play styles.

* **Tableau**  also offers a number of  *Playsets*  üéû that package together specific rules &amp; cards to create specific kinds of stories.  **Twilight Road**   üõ£ and  **Gate Watch**  üö™ are the first two of a number of  *Playsets*  üéû to come.
* Cards different  *Playsets*  üéû may be mixed &amp; matched with each other and with future  **Tableau  *Playsets***  üéû .

With  **Tableau** , you can let your imagination run wild and experience a unique and engaging way of storytelling that&#39;s perfect for anyone who loves gaming, storytelling, or just having fun with friends.

### Overview of Play

**Tableau**  works by providing players with a shared space called  *The Table* , which acts as a structure for the stories that they tell. Using  **Tableau**  cards that represent rules and storytelling elements, players can choose some to place on  *The Table*  with  *Table Consent* , which is when everyone agrees on a choice made together.

The game includes different types of  **Tableau**  cards, such as  *Safety* ,  *Narrative* ,  *Player Role* ,  *Casting* ,  *Drama* ,  *Story* , and  *Character*  cards, which allow players to create and develop unique characters and explore different story elements. Index cards are also used to demonstrate  *Table Consent*  for any rules or story elements not covered by  **Tableau**  cards, and they can be updated with significant details as the story progresses.

Additionally, players can  *Take Up*  some cards to give someone control over its story elements and the authority to use its  *Moves* .

For instance, for a simple road trip story using some of the 72-cards of  *Twilight Road*  üõ£ the storytellers might choose to put the following cards on  *The Table* :

* *Twilight Road*  Playset cards
* *Twilight Road*  Beats cards
* *Play Controls*  Safety Rule
* *Scenes*  Narrative Rule
* *Truths &amp; Questions*  Narrative Rule
* *Drama Tokens*  Drama Rule card
* *The Twilight*  Theme card
* *The Road*  Setting card
* *The Locals*  Setting card
* *The Director*  Player Role card
* *The Mapper*  Player Role card
* *The Driver*  Face card
* *The Buddy*  Face card
* *The Runaway*  Face card

![Storytellers Hand of Cards|680x383](upload://55XRMJ9e3aJIEXdr7CiHyzpdGFw.png) 

For a basic story, the storytellers will typically hold three or four cards ‚Äî a  *Player Role*  card, a  *Story*  Card, and one or two  *Character*  cards. The front side has the  *Setup*  details, and the back the  *Moves*  available while holding these cards. The story is told in a series of  *Scenes* , following the instructions of the  *Beats*  card on the  *Table* . Between  *Scenes*  the  *Director*  Player Role card is passed around, and  *Story*  cards can be  *Set Aside*  or  *Taken Up* . The  *Drama Tokens*  card defines how a token pool, ala &quot;Fate&quot; or &quot;Belonging Outside Belonging&quot; is used to create karma and tension. The  *Beats*  cards will guide the storytellers to a satisfying conclusion.

A different group might choose to substitute  *The Narrator*  for  *The Director*  player role for a more GM-style game or to run the last act of a mystery; or choose  *The Renegade*  instead of the  *The Buddy*  Face for a more Jack Kerouac  *&quot;On the Road&quot;*  style road trip; or  *The Entertainer*  Face for a  *&quot;Blues Brothers&quot;*  road trip. The  *Declare*  Drama Rules Card could be substituted for a more PbtA style of tension and risk. Rules from other playsets could be added, for instance  *The Other Side*  setting from the  *Gate Watch*  Playset could be a home for  *The Outsider*  Face card.
