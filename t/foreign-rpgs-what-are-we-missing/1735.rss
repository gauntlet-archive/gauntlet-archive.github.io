    <title>Foreign RPGs - What are we missing?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/foreign-rpgs-what-are-we-missing/1735</link>
    <description>Based on [The RPG scene in Korea](https://discourse.funtimers.club/t/the-rpg-scene-in-korea/1627) and other threads mentioning non-English language RPGs in passing, I think it would be cool to find out how does the RPG scene look in other countries. I think most of us are familiar with trends in US and UK, but every country will have its own unique and idiosyncratic games, modules and trends. 

So non-English speakers of the Gauntlet - how does the RPG scene look in where you are from?</description>

              <p>I would divide the Norwegian rpg scene into three parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Folks playing D&amp;D5e - This is by far the most popular game here, but oddly they are in a lot of cases not a big part of the RPG scene as such. I’m not quite sure, but my guess is that a lot of these folks find D&amp;D through following different online venues and possibly adventure league events. At least it seems to me like their presence is a lot smaller than what I’d think it would be at cons and such.</li>
<li>Folks playing things they played in the 90’s and 00’s, these are often 40+ years and is by my estimation the largest part of whatever RPG scene we have here. These folks play a lot of different stuff like Warhammer fantasy, Pathfinder, Runequest, Old World of Darkness stuff.</li>
<li>A tiny Indie RPG minority. This scene used to be pretty vibrant maybe 10 years back and even generated quite a few good designs of its own like Archipelago, Itras By, Society of Dreamers and some Norwegian titles that are unknown outside of Norway. There are quite a few of these that still play and have some sort of online presence, but its less of a community today. There even used to be a con where only Indie Games, Today there we mostly meet at the yearly con and have our homegroups.</li>
</ol>
<p>Design wise the most interesting stuff that comes out of Norway these days are larps. You can find some of the most interesting stuff at <a href="https://scenariofestival.se/archive/" rel="nofollow noopener">Stockholm Scenario Festival</a> and <a href="https://alexandria.dk/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fastaval archives</a>, quite a bit of it is available in english</p>

              <p>In France, we have a living RPG scene. A handful of publishers share the “big shots” projects, but the independent scene is solid too.</p>
<p>We have two magazines that are published every two months : <strong>Casus Belli</strong> and <strong>JDR Mag</strong>. We can find review, critics, scenarios, gaming aids, interviews in those.</p>
<p>As far as creation goes, we have a good variety.</p>
<p><strong>Chroniques Oubliées</strong> is a D20-OGL (DD3) inheritor,  which was first published as a light-D&amp;D. It nows is its own system, published within Casus Belli and then in stand-alone products. There is multiple variants : Fantastic, Contemporary, Horror, Western, Galactic, Vigilantes …</p>
<p><strong>Héros &amp; Dragon</strong> is based on the D&amp;D5 SRD, and was aimed to fill the gap that the non-translation of D&amp;D left. Now, D&amp;D is translated, and H&amp;D starts to have its own line.</p>
<p>In the indie scene, we have PBTA games that are doing well : <strong>Libreté</strong> (that has come to KS some weeks ago), <strong>Berlin XIV</strong> (cop &amp; anticipation), <strong>La Laverie</strong> (Charles Stross’ Laundry), <strong>Dominion</strong> (play a powerful family in a SF setting, fighting to stay on top) …</p>
<p>We also have some decent <strong>Descended from the Queen</strong> games hosted on <a href="http://ForTheDrama.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ForTheDrama.com</a></p>
<p>We have some weird creations around the <strong>Millevaux</strong> universe. Its author, Thomas Munier, created a haunted forest universe. That he declined in many variants (classic RPG, LARP, DFTQ, GM-less games) and all is in Public Domain. Other authors are starting to use it also in various games.</p>
<p>We also got a great website, <a href="http://www.legrog.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.legrog.org/</a>, that is a global encyclopedia for RPG (french and others).</p>

              <p>From Spain I would recommend:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nosolorol.com/es/aquelarre/39/aquelarre" rel="nofollow noopener">Aquelarre</a>:</strong> The first spanish RPG (1990) and one of the best ones. A D100 variant with a medieval-Spain setting full of angels and demons. The illustrations of the current edition are freaking awesome and the setting is one of the richest ever written.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.other-selves.com/p/ablaneda.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Ablaneda</a>:</strong> And awesome little jewel that few people know about even in Spain. The setting is fantastic medieval Spain (Asturias, indeed, if I remember well) and you play some sort of Night’s Watch’s bastards doing Mouse Guard-like missions. All written in a delightfully old-sounding Spanish. Uses a rules-light indie system called XD6 and all the material is available as a <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4819/Other-Selves/subcategory/9156_21996/Ablaneda" rel="nofollow noopener">PWYW PDFs</a>. It is, easily, my favorite spanish RPG right now.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://grapasymapas.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Vieja Escuela</a>:</strong> A rules-lite OSR game born in a fanzine and completely driven by an indie G+ Community (now defucnt, but still kicking in other platforms). It currently has many incarnations with the same D20 based system: Fantasy, Pulp, Cyberpunk, Western, Urban fantasy, Goonies, etc. and all of them (including <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dm7v8QHn30j0vpYB0S24xgFOSKRciHrN/view" rel="nofollow noopener">the english translation of the original fantasy version</a>) are <a href="https://skarfester.blogspot.com/2018/12/vieja-escuela-el-juego-de-rol.html" rel="nofollow noopener">free to download in PDF</a> and have a ridiculous price in Lulu. Very easily the most dynamic creative community in the current spanish panorama.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.walkure.es/" rel="nofollow noopener">Walküre</a>:</strong> What if we reach 2075 and the Nazis are still kicking? Walküre uses a 2d6+Hability generic system called CdB Engine, has 434 wonderfully illustrated pages and is <a href="https://app.box.com/s/a9xr1iebiekuvqgh4fms" rel="nofollow noopener">free to download</a>. Probably it is the most complete and professional spanish RPG that you can (legaly) download for free.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://espadanegra.net/jdr.php?b=introduccion" rel="nofollow noopener">Espada Negra</a>:</strong> Rules-heavy fantasy RPG with a very devoted community. It has many side-products associated, including a board game and some novels. Uses its own rune-based system (D2-based, indeed) and it is <a href="https://espadanegra.net/jdr.php?b=Descargas%20de%20rol" rel="nofollow noopener">free to download</a> too.</p>
<p>and, finally,</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nosolorol.com/es/" rel="nofollow noopener">Nosolorol</a>:</strong> It’s probably the editorial of reference in Spain and has many interesting titles, including a whole line of products that share a generic system called <a href="https://www.nosolorol.com/es/23-hitos" rel="nofollow noopener">Hitos</a> (roll 3d10 and keep the middle one) but implement different settings: from <em>you are a Lovecraftian cultist</em> (Cultos Innombrables) to <em>you are a masked vigilante</em> (La Mirada del Centinela) just to mention a pair of the most successful ones.</p>

Everyone talked about, I read about it in Magia i Miecz but people around me were mostly playing Vampire/Mage/Werewolf.

              <p>One of my favorites is Marcelo Del Debbio’s <em>Arkanum</em> (later expanded and rebranded <a href="https://www.daemon.com.br/home/trevas/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Trevas</em></a>). It was another Brazilian RPG from the 1990s to be heavily promoted in the pages of Dragão Brasil magazine, in which Del Debbio’s articles were rather regularly featured. <em>Trevas</em> is a game about secret societies and the war between angels and demons for the souls of humankind. Leaning heavily on the World of Darkness-type of grim n’ gritty, brooding, backstabby tropes which were all the rage back in the day, its setting purported nevertheless to be more grounded than WoD lore insofar as it relied on fictionalized versions of events from European history and constant reference to actual (if not accurately portrayed) organizations such as the Hospitaller Knights, the Rosicrucians and many others. I would guess <em>Trevas</em> is out of print for more than a decade now. Unfortunately, I’ve never heard of an English translation of this game.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>We also had a long-running RPG magazine in Brazil called Dragão Brasil (it had 100+ issues published between 1994 and 2007 and recently was revived as a crowdfunded digital magazine) that was pretty much the only source of RPG content in smaller cities in the pre-internet era.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, they published a rules-light satirical RPG called Defensores de Tóquio (Tokyo Defenders) that made fun of anime and super sentai tropes. It was cheap and fast and it arrived in stands as anime and manga started to take over Brazil. At some point, the system was so popular that it became the magazine’s flagship property. They used to adapt pretty much any popular property for the system, from Harry Potter to Evangelion, and that was my gateway to TTRPGs. I still think it was a remarkable feat of conversion to the hobby.</p>
<p>At some point in the '00s, the authors put together a lot of material from the magazine and created a medieval setting called Tormenta that mixed traditional DnD with mechas and lovecraftian monsters and everything they could think of. I played a four year long campaign of Tormenta when I was a teenager, before I “grew up” and met the World of Darkness (I was like fourteen XD). It is still published now and I thing it’s the most popular national setting?</p>
<p>Anyway, being a poor kid in the Northwestern region I didn’t know a lot of people who had access to RPG books apart from some eventual Vampire the Mascarade. The magazine was the first time I’ve read about a lot of authors and genres like cosmic horror and cyberpunk, besides RPG itself.  Was there anything like this in other countries? How did you get to know TTRPGs in smaller cities before the internet?</p>

              <p>As to German indie games, there was <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/64449/Western-City-English" rel="nofollow noopener">Western City</a>, published in 2008. I’ve never played it, but I heard good things about it.</p>
<p>Then there are the classic trad games:<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midgard_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow noopener">Midgard</a>, with a rather dated system that still managed to awe me with its flexibility back when that wasn’t possible with D&amp;D or other systems (I played a barbarian from the north who learned Magical Theory and a lot of languages and ended up as a professor in a southern academy).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Eye" rel="nofollow noopener">Das Schwarze Auge</a> is a traditional fantasy game as well with a very clunky system and an extremely detailed world. The world is kinda fun, though you should beware of setting fanatics - they might tell you that, no, as a person from Region X, your baron would have been Tsahilf the Second not Rondrine the Third, and that someone like you would never ride a pony but really had to ride a [type of horse]. Personally, I’ve never played the system (except for the first edition as an OSR callback once), but I’ve playing the world several times. It’s a bit clunky, but it is relatable.</p>
<p><a href="https://splittermond.de/" rel="nofollow noopener">Splittermond</a> (Shardmoon) is the newest trad fantasy game, the system is more streamlined and the world isn’t as well-defined as the Dark Eye world, but there is still a ton of lore. Never played it, but I like the guys who created it.</p>
<p><a href="http://faterpg.de/malmsturm/" rel="nofollow noopener">Malmsturm</a> - heavy metal fantasy for Fate. The setting is more sword &amp; sorcery, the system is, well, Fate, which I happen to like, but I haven’t had a chance to play yet.</p>
<p>Smaller stuff includes:<br>
<a href="https://www.prometheusgames.de/verlag/2015/05/30/return-to-the-eighties-funky-colts/" rel="nofollow noopener">Funky Colts</a>, a game about 80’s action series like the A-Team or The Fall Guy or McGyver. The system is a lot leaner, and I vaguely remember having fun with it.</p>

              <p>I’ll mention one more Finnish game! <em>Hiljaisuuden vangit</em> (The Prisoners of Silence) is a legendary Nineties game, in part because it’s almost impossible to find anywhere nowadays. It’s a near-future dystopian game in which Finland has suffered a fascist takeover. The characters are in trouble with the state for whatever reason and have to survive in conditions of terror.</p>
<p>It’s themes felt more abstract when it came out, but somehow in the intervening years, its become quite timely.</p>

              <p><em>The Elephant &amp; Macaw Banner</em> is also quite educational. The Brazilian edition was subsidised by the Ministry of Culture and about a third of the print run, if I am remembering correctly, went to schools. There’s a big chapter in the back about using the game in the classroom, with essays by different educators.</p>

              <p>This is a great discussion! I love learning about games outside the English -speaking sphere. I’m from Finland and we have a lot of stuff, unfortunately little of it in English.</p>
<p>We got started in the mid-Eighties with the first game by Finland’s most prolific designer, <strong>Risto Hieta</strong>. The somewhat improbable title of our first game is <em>The Secret Treasure of Raguoc in the Acirema Dungeons</em>. Hieta is still active as a designer. <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/188443/Acirema-Dungeons--Player-Book" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/188443/Acirema-Dungeons--Player-Book</a></p>
<p>Today, we have the designer <strong>Miska Fredman</strong> who has done a number of games in the big book, gorgeous graphics style. The most interesting is called <em>Sotakarjut</em>, War Pigs. It combines a scifi colonial marines style action with delicate issues of body dysmorphia. The characters are genetically engineered pig soldiers embedded with memories of human lives and bodies.</p>
<p>Another designer is <strong>Mike Pohjola</strong>, also well known in the Nordic Larp sphere for writing the <em>Manifesto of the Turku School</em>. His most recent game is <em>Age of the Tempest</em>, an introductory fantasy game for children. He’s also designed the game <em>Tähti</em> (Star) about Maoist mutant girl bands. It has a special place in my heart because I met my wife in the rpg campaign that spawned the publication.</p>
<p>When it comes to the big games people play, there’s <strong>Ville Vuorela</strong>, who has two important publications. One is <em>Praedor</em>, a low fantasy roleplaying game based on the comics by <strong>Petri Hiltunen</strong>. It has a dedicated player community and is one of the most played Finnish games. He’s also designed the official roleplaying game adaptation for the <strong>Strugatski</strong> brothers novel <em>Roadside Picnic</em>, called <em>Stalker</em>. <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product_info.php?products_id=100243&amp;" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product_info.php?products_id=100243&amp;</a></p>
<p>Then there’s me, also active in Nordic Larp as well. I’ve published two games on my own, <em>Valley of Eternity</em> (about tragic penguin heroes) and <em>Chernobyl, Mon Amour</em> (about love and radioactivity). <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/103305/Valley-of-Eternity-English" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/103305/Valley-of-Eternity-English</a></p>
<p>We got plenty more as well, but maybe this’ll do for now…</p>

<p>I know of <strong>Das Schwarze Auge</strong>, and it seems it is still pretty big in Germany - is there anything we are missing about it (although I think there might have been an English version of it)? Any other trad games we might be missing out on?</p>

              <p>I really love the idea of The Bandeirantes’ Challenge, especially that it was accurate enough to be used in schools. I have a soft spot for historical RPGs that mix in some myth and folklore. I will definately check A Bandeira do Elefante e da Arara once it is translated. Hoping for that mixing of myth with history. In the meantime, could you tell us more about those two games (or just The Bandeirantes’ Challenge, if you don’t know the other that well)?</p>
<p>As for the xerox generation. It was also quite common in Poland. Copying books was considerably cheaper than buying a new book. The first RPG book I owned was a xerox copy of Cyberpunk2020, that I have lent to some friends of my brother and it was never returned - I never got to play it <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>As far as indie goes, you’re not missing a lot in Germany. That’s only really taken off in the last two to three years after a big podcast turned publisher and started cranking out translations of OSR, PbtA and indie rpgs.</p>
<p>Notable exceptions of recent German language indie rpgs:</p>
<p>Aaron Böhler’s <strong>Nach Aussen Gewendet</strong> from 2018, a lovely game about commuting and public transport written for a small contest: <a href="https://penandpodcast.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nach-au%C3%9Fen-gewendet-PDF.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">https://penandpodcast.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nach-außen-gewendet-PDF.pdf</a></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tina">@tina</a>’s <strong>Dear Distant Stars</strong>, a Science Fiction hack of the letter-writing game Dear Elizabeth “inspired by Makoto Shinkai’s Voices of a Distant Star and Interstellar” (published in Das Erzählspiel Zine, a great indie rpg zine with three issues and a few more original games published since 2017): <a href="https://www.erzaehlspiel-zine.de/ausgaben/ausgabe_003/spiel-dear-distant-stars/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.erzaehlspiel-zine.de/ausgaben/ausgabe_003/spiel-dear-distant-stars/</a></p>
<p>Not a game per se but including nano games is <strong>Roll Inclusive</strong>, ed. by Aşkın-Hayat Doğan, Frank Reiss and Judith Vogt, a collection of essays on diversity and representation in rpgs, crowdfunded in February 19: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/174015938/roll-inclusive-diversity-und-reprasentation-im-rol" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/174015938/roll-inclusive-diversity-und-reprasentation-im-rol</a></p>
