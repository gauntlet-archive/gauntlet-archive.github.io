    <description>Folks, we are delighted to let you know that [Hearts of Wulin is now on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gauntlet/hearts-of-wulin). Please help spread the word as much as you can. RTs of our [twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/GauntletRPG/status/1128300221732130817) &amp; [facebook announcement](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gauntlet.rpg/permalink/2045667828877238/) would be lovely!

Hearts of Wulin is Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA), meaning its mechanics are inspired, in part, by Apocalypse World by Vincent and Meguey Baker. The game is strongly influenced by several recent PbtA games, including Monsterhearts 2 by Avery Alder and The Veil by Fraser Simons. That said, Hearts of Wulin stands on its own, and has several distinct features that help players tell stories steeped in wuxia melodrama.
