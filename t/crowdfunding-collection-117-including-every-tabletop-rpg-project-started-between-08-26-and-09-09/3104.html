          <p>I present to you the <a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/09/09/crowdfunding-collection-117/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>new Crowdfunding Collection #117, including every tabletop rpg project started between 08/26 and 09/09.</b></a></p>
<p>Following a small break, I am back with no fewer than 64, of which 16 are actual new games. Giving a small shout out to a new German game, I think <b>SteaMage</b> is worth having a look, though with that being said, back to the English ones</p>
<p><b>Rod, Reel, &amp; Fist</b> is a quite unique game with its focus on actual fishing. I like how the task, which can be boring when not done in real life, is spiced up with dramatic tension and realized with a narrative system. The author did a fine job with The Dawnline and I am actually very tempted to back the book. If you are new to games or want to introduce someone to the hobby, maybe <b>First Look</b> is a good choices. It focuses on one-shots and being accessible. <b>Tenebria</b> on the other hand has a more ’serious‘ approach. It places the player as the remains of the fallen Roman empire in the titular town and has them defend it against overwhelming forces. Back to the more family friendly all-age games you might be interested in <b>The Magical Land of Yeld</b>. The game looks cute and I guess it ain’t a brutal hunt for mermaids. Should you be rather looking for some multi-genre game, <b>The Realm of the Gateway</b> is again trying to be funded.<br>
Then there are quite some fantasy games. Like the rather dark <b>Hunters of the Chalice Lands</b>, which has beautiful illustrations and comes with a D&amp;D 5E/OSR ruleset. Thus being not to far off the Black Hack based <b>Barbarians of the Ruined Earth</b> by Mike Evans. If you like the setting by Mantics, you’ll probably fancy the <b>Kings of War Role-Playing Game</b> and fans of Stephen Hunt get another chance at funding <b>Crown and Dragon</b>.<br>
If you took interest in the Blades in the Dark game engine Forged in the Dark and like near future action games, check out <b>Adrenaline: Near Future</b>. I got an eye on its progression. Fans of Powered by the Apocalypse can get their fill of Magical Girl tropes with <b>Glitter Hearts</b> and if they were to rather explore a basically tokyo setting should have a look at <b>Shibuyan Knights</b>.<br>
Which ain’t the only Anime or „Japanese popculture“ inspired games. There’s <b>Henshin! A Sentai RPG</b> on the one hand. Where you fight basically as a mighty power ranger against evil (tho without dice). Well and <b>Wave Man</b> where your character is a Samurai or Ninja, maybe both, and can brave adventures in solo play mode or with friends.<br>
Those who are into SF might take a look at the expansive <b>TerrorForm</b> rpg. It appears to offer quite some background and caters to several styles of play. Well and am not sure how much SF is in<b> Worm Hole to Uranus</b>, yet it got a buttload of „uranus“ jokes and appears to be a fun beer &amp; pretzels party game.<br>
There are many, many, more cool project. Which I can’t possible all mention. Thus take a look for yourself::</p>
