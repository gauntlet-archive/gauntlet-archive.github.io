    <description>This is a 5 session run of Under Hollow Hills by Vincent and Meguey Baker.

One seat is reserved for Jesse A.

Prior experience isn&#39;t required, all rules will be taught in play. The game will not be recorded. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. We will probably be using Streamyard but that might change. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils, the X-Card and the Open Table safety tools. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

I&#39;m interested in leaning towards the literary and theatrical aspects of the game - not in terms of performance or anything - but instead of describing the fiction as a movie or TV show like I usually do, I would love to talk about it as a book of fairy tales or a play being staged. It&#39;ll be my first time running the game but I&#39;m very excited to give it a whirl.

**About The Game:**

There is a traveling circus under the Hollow Hills. It travels by moonlight, small wagons creaking in the night silence. It travels lost roads, where fireflies and whisps hover to watch it pass, where goblins peer down from their treebranch perches, and owls. It travels the night world and the day world, fairyland and the living earth, and places otherwise, and no border can keep it.

You are its performers and its crew, its ringmaster, its clowns and tumblers, its lookouts and roustabouts, its planners and problem-solvers, its stars. You are its celebrated headliners and you are the fugitives who travel, opportunistically, with it. You are the mysteries it poses, the dramas it performs; you are music, juggling, acts of death-defying peril, pratfall comedy, you are moments of beauty and moments of loss. You are the circus and the circus is you. You have dangerous secrets to tell.

You go where you go and you perform where you choose.
