    <description>Like many others around here, I&#39;ve been excited about the release of For The Queen for a while now. I&#39;ve also been working on a hack of it. Today, the designer (Alex Roberts) and publisher [launched an SRD](https://twitter.com/muscularpikachu/status/1123667353810587648) for the game and encouraged people working on hacks (which they&#39;re calling games Descended From The Queen) to make themselves known.

Twitter&#39;s great for that kind of announcement, but I wanted to find a space to talk more in depth. Who else is working on DFTQ games? I&#39;m curious what people have learned about hacking FTQ: what is the core system best at? What experiments have you tried and failed? What parts of the original game are load-bearing? What&#39;s your game, and why are you excited about it?

I&#39;m working on a hack about an adventuring party with a cursed member, and the questions are all geared towards treating this situation as a metaphor for chronic disease. The game still centers around a central figure like the Queen (in this case a Cursed person), but in my current draft, one of the players is designated as that figure. I like the way FTQ&#39;s Queen being an NPC naturally gives a distance to her, but I also like what bringing a centralized figure down to the player level does in my game.

I&#39;ve also played around with having two decks of question cards (one for the Cursed, one for people who aren&#39;t), or question cards that have two questions depending on which role you have, though I haven&#39;t loved either of those mechanics.

What are you making, what have you tried out that&#39;s different from For The Queen, and how is it going for you? I&#39;m pumped to play lots of DFTQ games in the future.</description>

              <p>It’s beginning to take shape. Writing prompts is a tough redaction job, but using a foundational structure (2x2D in this case) really helps in making everything fall into place. Each card decants and settles nicely, given time.<br>
One thing I need is a table tool or role to switch the tempo from electro/bop to blues/sacred music. Maybe a China Card to flip each time you do X?</p>

<p>True I don’t need to, and I may not, but getting rid of the “set aside all 23456 cards” step is one step ahead in my accessibility crusade. Also, adding more story elements is both interesting and trivially easy. Harder will be morphing my 4x8 card questions table into a 6x6=36 questions table in case a deck of cards is lacking but someone found a die in a drawer of the house they stay at for the hollydays.<br>

<p>I don’t know that you need to rehash the code though. Playing with stripped decks is pretty common across card games. I grew up on Euchre, which uses only 9 10 J Q K A, and promotes Jacks of trump color to the top-ranking spots each hand.</p>

              <p>In part, but mostly not. Tarot culture is not widespread, so I can’t suppose players are familiar with it.<br>
The meaning of the suits inform my choice but it’s not fixed enough to be that useful. Also male figures are over represented.<br>
So I try to make an ad hoc code efficient enough: simple to decode, conveying abstract information. Something like 78xxJQKA = item/place/xx/people/leader/collective/value<br>
Ranks 9&amp;10 I use for dramatic devices  It makes sense in the context of french card games where 10 trumps K and 9&amp;J (on top) of the trump suit trump all. So 9&amp;10 are for “weakness” and “treason”.<br>
So, I don’t really manage intuitivity but am confident I will get simplicity (but I’ll need to make a 52/54 cards version and rehash the code…)</p>

              <p>Thank you for your interest.<br>
I like the light brainload, too. I never intended to work on a DftQ because like you I believe they’re like a certain protagonist of Jarmusch: “good at what they do”. But as I am doing it for someone, I might as well add something I feel DftQ games lack: some sort of structure - that we usually achieve by a combination of chance and X card. <a class="mention" href="/u/gulix">@Gulix</a> already solved this with acts, so I needed to try some other innovation, on principle. So I went and fetched the old “consonants / vowels” chime from Le mot le plus long. Couldn’t find any simpler:<br>
</p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="VXpTMuW8q74" data-youtube-title="Countdown Blooper - E From Consonant Box" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>My vow of accessibility means the game must be playable with a french deck (32 cards). Therefore, each card will be read on one of two different tables.</p>
<p>Now, here’s at least 1 impossible task before breakfast: I try very hard for the cards themselves to convey the meaning of the prompts. I mean: after a game session, players should be able to guess what a given card could mean. So that they feel the location/event/character was waiting for them (face down) all along, and not in the printed list of prompts. I’m eating my hat on this I think, but I will have tried my best, at least.</p>
<p>Who would have thought I had so much to say about so simple a game? I’m aweful vain, but what can I do?</p>

              <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/samr">@SamR</a>,</p>
<p>thank you so much for your detailed answer. This is much appreciated. Sorry for my late response!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You are totally right about the intro. I wanted to keep a lighter tone, but you are right in changing it the way you suggested. I was also thinking to phrase it a bit more generic. So that the group could decide how they “stranded”: plane, ship, spaceship or other. Would be “wreck” a neutral way to phrase it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, that´s a tough one. I got the chance to playtest the game last week and my players liked the one as presented. I don´t think “Do you leave the island or stay” is aiming towards the questions/emotions I would like to provoke with my prompts. I would argue that 90% will say they´re leaving. My goal was to carefully choose questions who could be interpreted in a positive or negative way - depending on the few on the world of the character. But none of the questions - I think - would built a kind of utopia, so that sb. really wanted to stay on the island.<br>
What do you think?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will change it to “they” than. Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, that sounds right to me as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion about the additional influences. Thats a really good suggestion. Maybe insperation strikes me and I will change some of the questions.  For example the one where a stranger joins the group. I´m not a fan of that one. Did you have some other particular questions in mind which are “recreating” scenes of the show. (To be fair I only watched season 1 and 2, so I might as well just have drawn form standard tropes here <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Lost Island sounds cool! It reminds me a bit more of a pulp fiction title. But maybe thats because I had a look at your Dino Island game (which sounds awesome by the way)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While playtesting I also realized that the questions about the group splitting up would be really hard to answer as the first or even the third card. In our game the second question was the one with a person coming and holding your hand. The player did a really good job in describing/answering it. But I think that is an other one which is kind of hard to answer as the first, second or third question - But I really like that question, to be honest <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, thank you for taking time to answer my questions and have a look at “my” game. That means a lot to me.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Lost is one of my favorite shows, so this is right up my alley. I just read through the cards and I dig it!</p>
<p>To answer your specific questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I think the intro text is a little too playful, with the Friday the 13th and Bermuda Triangle references. I might draw on Lost here and keep it very simple. Something like: “1: You wake up to the squawks of seagulls and the scent of briny air. You’re on a beach?” "2: Suddenly, it all comes back to you. The sudden storm. The cabin depressurization. Your plane hurtling toward the ground. " “3. The fact that you survived is a miracle.” “4. Now you’re on this island.” “5. Waiting.” “6. Hoping for another miracle.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final question is a tough one. I think it needs to be a more pointed question. Maybe “Do you leave the island or stay?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would use “they” rather than “she”. They has become very common as a neutral pronoun and in some of the cards, particularly the romantic ones, “she” felt like it created weird assumptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wouldn’t worry about marking uncomfortable questions — that’s why you have the x-card. If you’re concerned, I might put it in the instructions when you describe the X-card. “Some cards have themes like death or attraction that might make you uncomfortable. This is one situation where you can use the x-card.” or whatever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would need to go through them again, but overall they all felt very thematic and on point to me on the first read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe just “The Lost Island”? Sometimes we get too caught up in following the naming convention of the original game. I don’t think it needs a “For the” if you don’t want it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing I’ll also add is that I’d love to see you find some additional influences for the game. I <em>love</em> Lost, but I worry that you might be leaning on it too heavily. I worry that I might end up recreating scenes and ideas from the show instead of exploring my own. Maybe you could add some prompts that explicitly go in directions that lost didn’t go? Some other lost island fiction to draw on, just off the top of my head: Castaway, Tomb Raider, Myst.</p>
<p>Very excited to see where this goes though!</p>

              <p>Hi everyone! I follow the gauntlet forum for quite some time now.<br>
I really appreciate the conversations here and would love to get some insights from you.</p>
<p>I just finished the first draft my DftQ Game “For The Lost Island”. And <a class="mention" href="/u/matthieu_b">@Matthieu_b</a> was kind enough to publish it on his website: <a href="https://www.forthedrama.com/games/lostisland" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.forthedrama.com/games/lostisland</a><br>
For The Lost Island is a game about a group of surviors trying their best after they crashed on an lost island - in the veins of lord of the flies or the name giving tv series “lost”.<br>
This is a game about exploration. Exploration of the island as well as the exploration of the emotions of this group of individuals.</p>
<p>Here are some points I would love to get some feedback from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>I´m not happy about the intro text, yet. What images does it provoke in you? What would you rather change?</li>
<li>Same for the final question. It is really hard for me to nail that one down …</li>
<li>As english is not my first language, I´m concerned if my questions/prompts are phrased neutral enough. For example in German there is the neutral word “Person” -&gt; person. But I´m not sure which pronoun to use with it, to indicate I mean the neutral status. Is “she” correct? Sorry, if that sounds to confusing. If so, please ignore that point <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:">
</li>
<li>There are some questions about themes like death or physical attraction. Which not everyone will feel comfortable about. Do you think it would be a good idea to mark those questions in some way? Like a # or sth. like that? If so, which questions you would consider?</li>
<li>Do you feel that some of the prompts are to restrictive? If so, which ones?</li>
<li>Got a better name for the game? Please let me know <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the intro text, as it stands for now, so that you get an idea of what I had in mind for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You were in good spirits when you boarded the small plane of flight 815.<br>
Despite that silly Friday the 13th.<br>
Even the small turbulences in between were by no means alarming.<br>
But a blizzard in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle?<br>
A short time later the engines fail.<br>
First came the silence. Then the panic. Then came the darkness.<br>
The fact that you survived the crash is a miracle.<br>
You’re on this island now.<br>
Waiting.<br>
Hoping.<br>
On what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your time. If you have any questions, I´m happy to answer them <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

              <p>Exactly the problem I was running into! It’s so easy to start (Oh, I just make up some questions!) but then when you get into it, it’s actually much trickier to get a sense of whether you’re making up the right questions.</p>
<p>On that note: If anyone wants to give my extremely alpha draft a glance or playthrough, it’s now on For the Drama: <a href="https://forthedrama.com/games/treasure" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forthedrama.com/games/treasure</a> (Thanks, <a class="mention" href="/u/matthieu_b">@Matthieu_b</a>!)</p>
<p>Here’s the background:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Somewhere far from here, there is a Treasure. There are other treasures, but this one is uniquely precious.</em></p>
<p><em>The journey to recover the Treasure is long and perilous. Many have tried and failed.</em></p>
<p><em>You, and only you, have decided to venture forth together to recover the Treasure.</em></p>
<p><em>Each of you has your own reason for seeking the Treasure, but all of you would rather die than return empty-handed.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hope is that the game explores D&amp;D/Indiana Jones-style treasure hunting through a DftQ lens, to examine why people hunt for treasure in the first place and how we decide that we deserve to have what others do not.</p>

              <p>That’s that. For <strong>Final Lap</strong>, after a few games that were OK but didn’t get the feel I wanted, I reviewed the questions with those themes in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>camaraderie amongst pilots</li>
<li>this race is dangerous</li>
<li>the cost of winning</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m currently paused in designing my reporter’s game “<strong>The Case that will make the Headline</strong>”, but here are the themes I’m looking into:</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re all competing, but on the same side</li>
<li>obsession</li>
<li>truth or glory?</li>
</ul>
<p>I also got three broad categories : the McGuffin (the Champion in the first one, the Case in the second), the Others (player characters), Yourself. And I try to get a balance between each.</p>

              <p>Similar to <a class="mention" href="/u/gulix">@Gulix</a> I organized cards around certain aspects of the fiction. My game is about sages performing a ritual that will seal a great evil away. So I divided my questions into a few groups of 8 cards each. The Ritual (questions about the ritual itself and it’s workings) ; The Other Sages (questions about other players, all of these sew mistrust) ; The Darkness (flesh out the evil in the game and show why some might welcome it) ; The Past (world building and character building questions, often things that characters are hiding) ; Hopes and Fears ( Flesh out motivations for the sages, sew seeds of epilogue material) It makes the whole creativity part a lot easier when you shrink the cognitive load from “Make up 52 great questions!” to “What are eight questions about the other players that will make them not trust each other?”</p>
<p>For future games I’ll probably create even more categories than I plan to use, and then edit down with play testing. It’s super easy to edit these games because removing cards from a deck or adding new ones in is simple.</p>

              <p>Interesting!</p>
<p>When you say “aspects,” do you mean themes?</p>
<p>So like in For the Queen, it might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Queen is worthy of your love.</li>
<li>The Queen is terrible and unworthy of your love.</li>
<li>The Queen complicates your relationship with the other members of the retinue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the idea of solo-testing different settings. That’s something I’m thinking a lot about!</p>
