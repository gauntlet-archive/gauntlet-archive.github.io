    <description>Is anyone going to Forge Midwest this year? I have wanted to go ever since hearing The Jank Cast talk about it, and this is the year I&#39;m going to do it. I don&#39;t know many people in The Gauntlet who are going, though.</description>

              <p>Awesome!</p>
<p>I’ll be going. This will be my 6th time to FMW. Lots of friendly people. Very informal but there are time slots to help let people know when to pitch their games.</p>
<p>There’s almost always 1+ PbtA game offered. There is no pressure for you to run anything if you don’t want to. I waited a couple years before running to get more comfortable with the new community. Some board and card games, sometimes there are LARPS and often playtests.</p>
<p>Eric Farmer, designer of Trash Pandas, and his partner, Tina are planning to attend. He and his podcast partner may be demoing some ideas on their Wuxia game.</p>
