    <description>Hello,
It seems that I missed my first game on the Gauntlet Calendar because of a stupid mistake: the game was announced in the Calendar as &quot;Tuesday, March 22nd 2022, 12:00 am&quot;
To frenchie me, this was obviously on tuesday, march the 22nd, one hour after 11:00 am. I still wonder why it&#39;s not. Right now I&#39;m angry at the persons who thought that error (I can&#39;t think of it any other way) needed to exist, because I both missed a much waited game and was rude to my partners by not showing up.

I [strongly suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Confusion_at_noon_and_midnight) changing the time display format on the Calendar.</description>

<p>Thank you all for your empathy. I have digested my anger and my pain is past. The rest of the virtual table reached resignation too. I’m happy to enjoy luxury problems in a caring community.</p>

<p>The whole date should be shown based on the user’s locale, but perhaps DeReel is using a browser with American English as default language (I do, because I need sometimes to follow tutorials in English).</p>

<p>Precisely, I want something that is neither 12:00  am nor 12:00 pm to avoid confusion. Any solution (12 noon / 12 midnite, 24h format, etc.) suits me and I’m thankful that you look into it at all.</p>
