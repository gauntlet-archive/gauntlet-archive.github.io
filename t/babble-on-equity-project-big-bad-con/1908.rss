    <description>Big Bad is one of my favorite conventions. If you have the opportunity and ability to come, I totally think is is worth it. But conventions are also a thing of privilege. Conventions can cost a lot of money (flight, hotel, food, time off, time away, etc.). Not everyone has the ability. I want to help make one of my favorite conventions more accessible to people of color. 

&gt; **There are no physical rewards. There are no bells or whistles.**

I&#39;m here to contribute. I&#39;d love to see more people of color at all conventions, but I&#39;ll happily start with one of my favorites. I&#39;ve supported. I would love if others could. I would love if you have the means to attend as well.
