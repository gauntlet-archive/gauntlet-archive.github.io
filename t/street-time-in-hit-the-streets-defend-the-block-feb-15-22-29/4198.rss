    <description>Street Time in Hit the Streets: Defend the Block
Date: February 15, 22, 29
Time: 9:00 pm
System: Hit the Streets: Defend the Block
Number of players: 4
Description: You used to be in the supers game as a black hat, but you never hit the big leagues and it was a long time ago. Maybe the power faded, maybe you took a trick arrow to the knee, or maybe you just got wise. Now you just want to meet your PO and blend in, but since when did you ever get what you wanted? 

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

There will be 3 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy will be in play and the X-Card will be in use.</description>
