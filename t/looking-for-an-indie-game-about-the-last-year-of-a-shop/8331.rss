    <title>Looking for an indie game about the last year of a shop</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-for-an-indie-game-about-the-last-year-of-a-shop/8331</link>
    <description>Hi there,

as the title says I am looking for a game about the last year of a shop which is being closed and the employees were laid off. Unfortunately I can&#39;t remember the details. The game was really small - about 2 pages? Very free form. 

You played through a full year, each season being one chapter of the story. You start in January outside the shop and tell the other players about the new year&#39;s party and your wishes for the new year when you are invited in to receive the bad news of the shop being closed. IIRC the final scene would be on christmas eve or so. The tone is a bit cynic / humorous.

Does anybody know the game? Or even better know where to get it? I once had it as a PDF but I forgot where I got it from.</description>
