              <p>I think those are fair critiques! Know that I do plan on publishing several scenarios in addition to Food of the Gods and those should each have different takes on what a CDG scenario can look like and do.</p>
<p>I’ll also say that, in the vein of Cthulhu Dark, the system really shines with improvisational play. A good concept for an operation will take you a long long way.</p>

              <p>And I think it will work really well for that. But as I mentioned, this is more about my expectations from the product description than anything else. He hasn’t done anything wrong. It looks like a great game that will do what you need it to do and drive the DG style of play. I just think the GM half could be improved.</p>

              <p>I bought it over the weekend and it looks really good. Just enough extra rules to fit the <em>Delta Green</em> theme without going too far from <em>Cthulhu Dark</em>, as other hacks do.</p>
<p>I like how it handles stress, insight and mental illness. The at-home scenes look simple and evocative for the theme, as does exposure. All could easily have become more complex, but they really don’t need to be. Kudos.</p>
<p>My only disappointment was when it hits the GM/handler section. The general advice is fine, but there’s little about running an investigative scenario, with leads and clues management, which has its own challenges to other styles of game. A little could also have been added about trying to hold down your day job while investigating the Mythos.</p>
<p>There is also a lack of scenarios and campaign creation support. Maybe it was my misreading of the product description, but I thought that since it describes itself as supporting improvisational campaigns and having tables to “inspire play” that there would be a rules-light attempt at something like <em>Lovecraftesque</em> or <em>tremulus</em>. Instead it looks like it supports those by being rules light, maybe?</p>
<p>Instead, there are several pages of tables for what to find in a safe box, and a list of TV shows to watch. There’s more addressing safety at the table than for creating cases, which is important, obviously, especially for a horror game, but still a little surprising.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a great, rules-light way to run existing <em>Delta</em> <em>Green</em>-style scenarios. Good job Justin!</p>

              <p>I ran the classic Delta Green scenarios A Victim of the Art, Music from a darkened Room and Nightfloors with Cthulhu Deep Green and really enjoyed it, although for one shots / few shots I would limit the Bonds to just one in order to increase the tension. <a class="mention" href="/u/will_h">@Will_H</a> I will definitely put something on the calendar soonish.
