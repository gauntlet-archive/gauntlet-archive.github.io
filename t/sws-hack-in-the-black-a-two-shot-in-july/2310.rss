    <description>*I&#39;m going to be running Hack Wars from Peter Frain, with space combat borrowed from The Space Hack by Kirt Dankmyer.*

Want to hurtle through space, complete improbable missions, and shoot Imperials in the face? Join Reekeene&#39;s Roughnecks, a band of Irregulars for the Alliance to Restore the Republic (that&#39;s the Rebellion for those at home)!

You&#39;ll become a vital member of the crew of The Long Shot, a &quot;liberated&quot; Imperial pleasure yacht that&#39;s been retrofitted where it counts. You&#39;re under-funded, outnumbered, and still expected to get the job done.

All in a day&#39;s work for you, right? 

-------------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

Being able to attend both sessions is not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. We will be using the X-Card as well as Roses and Thorns after each session.

This game session will be recorded. This session is scheduled for 3 hours.
