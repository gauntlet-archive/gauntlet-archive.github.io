    <title>Swords of the Serpentine: Ill Met in Eversink</title>

    <description>This is for four sessions of *Swords of the Serpentine*, a GUMSHOE-powered game of fantasy investigation and problem solving. These will be Tuesdays in October at 2000 US ET. General RSVPs open 8/19. Pre-Gens will be presented, which you will have the chance to tweak. Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. In session one we will discuss safety &amp; tone, pick and detail characters, build connections, and move into play.

*Swords of the Serpentine is a sword &amp; sorcery game of daring heroism, sly politics, and bloody savagery, set in a fantasy city rife with skullduggery and death. The rules adapt the GUMSHOE investigative roleplaying system to create a fantasy RPG with a focus on high-action roleplaying and investigation inspired by the stories of Fritz Leiber, Terry Pratchett, Robert E. Howard, and others.*

*Your characters will discover leads that, if followed, propel them headlong into danger and forbidden knowledge. A lead might point the way to sunken treasure, jungle ruins, the missing key to a sorcerous trap, or the true identity of a notorious murderer. The GUMSHOE game mechanics ensure that you’ll always notice leads if you look for them. It’s up to you to choose which one you’ll follow into whatever perils lie ahead, in hopes of fortune, glory, justice, or just staying alive another day.*

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.</description>
