    <description>I present to you the new &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2019/11/24/crowdfunding-collection-124/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #124, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/03 and 11/24.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

As I had to take a two weeks vacation brake, the collection has about 90 projects, so let’s get to them.

If you are interested in original German tabletop rpgs, you might like to have a look at &lt;b&gt;Milan&lt;/b&gt;. Well, and if you like some maps, you might like to checkout &lt;b&gt;Jannasaras Kartentasche&lt;/b&gt;.

Back to the English projects, I’d like to start with &lt;b&gt;Electric Bastionland&lt;/b&gt;. The game from the creator of Into the Odd presents a fascinating setting, in which one plays a character that failed badly and is in debt – basically being the perfect person to go onto adventures to solve their problems. I would guess that the system is rather lite, OSR inspired and am tempted to back it. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Res Obscura&lt;/b&gt; a steampunk fantasy rpg set during the Victorian age. The project doesn’t talk alot about its system, though its being translated from Italian. If we move somewhat ahead in time, we’ll come to &lt;b&gt;Lightning War&lt;/b&gt;. It’s set during World War II, yet has fantasy creatures included. Well, and systemwise  it takes inspiration from Skirmish games. If you prefer your fantasy more classic, without real history spice, check out &lt;b&gt;Quest&lt;/b&gt;. Which offers quite some expose on its d20 mechanics. If your looking for a narrative game, check out &lt;b&gt;One More Thing&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a two player game, in which a criminal case is solved. Putting the emphazise square on the „how“ and not the „if“-which is a given.  Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Charm&lt;/b&gt;. Offering a universal game fit to play every kind of character in any Genre. It does look charming indeed.
&lt;b&gt;The Curse of the House of Rookwood&lt;/b&gt; offers an intruiging Gothic Horror role-playing game. It sees the players playing characters within a family, where everyone has things to hide and skeletons in the closed – maybe even literal. I am enticed by the setting, the focus on family and generational play and couldn’t resist it. I do recommend having a look. &lt;b&gt;Vaesen&lt;/b&gt; offers another take on the Gothic Horror genre.  It uses nordic mythologie as the bases for its setting, yet diverges from the common stuff I knew beforehand, making it a fresh take. The ruleset is an adapted version of the Tales of the Loop one. I do recommend having a look at it.
&lt;b&gt;VIGOR: Into the Dust&lt;/b&gt; is a game for those who prefer post-apocalyptic settings, which aren’t nighlistic and drab. Yet Vigors setting gives me a Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and the system is character forward and focused on survival and getting the community to thrive. Which has me considering backing it. &lt;b&gt;The Ruin&lt;/b&gt; on the other hand offers a more classical post-apocalypse, focusing on survival horror. It does use a D&amp;D 5E inspired system, which you can checkout by their quickstart. Thus, take a look. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Aftermath&lt;/b&gt;, which has an apocalyptic setting, yet a rather sparse description. If you want to get more information on it, check the video.
Then there are quite some Urban Fantasy games, like &lt;b&gt;Of Dreams and Magic 2nd Edition: The Waking Worl&lt;/b&gt;d. The concept of a world, overlayered by a dream world. Which does look fascinating and reminds me a bit of Invisible Sun, just more accessible. I recommend having a look at it.  Then there is Onyx Path, granting &lt;b&gt;Mummy: The Curse&lt;/b&gt; a 2nd edition. In this Chronicles of Darkness game you assume the role of an eternal, timeless Mummy which is effectively immortal and possesses a cult. You can take a look at the manuscript of the book once you backed and I recommend having a look. Another good call would be backing the &lt;b&gt;City of Mist: Starterbox&lt;/b&gt;. It offers you everything to play the cool mix of the PbtA and Fate system to play essentially urban fantasy coded superheroes. Though, if you rather like to play Power Rangers, Sailor Moon Warriors or similar teams check out &lt;b&gt;If Not Us, Then Who?&lt;/b&gt;. It uses an interesting card based system.
&lt;b&gt;Vampire: the Masquerade – Blood Feud&lt;/b&gt; is a „Mega Board Game“ and thus unites aspects of role-playing games, card games and a mega game. The game is made for 4 up to 32 players, which have four different station to vie for controll of the city. I do think that the idea is very cool, the miniatures are plently and nice and the box is neatly fit. I backed it and would like to recommend it very highly! Especially as it has only hours, under three days, left.
&lt;b&gt;The Wishing Sigil&lt;/b&gt; is on the clock as well. Basically you’ll get a story prompt for every advent day, and thus basically solo-play a little campaign. I think it’s a cool idea and close enough to role-playing. Have a look and form your own mind.
There are many more, cool projects. You can participate in the Patreon from &lt;b&gt;DavidTvGames&lt;/b&gt; and help him develop gaming resources, you might be interesting in backing the sourcebook &lt;b&gt;The Islands of Sina&lt;/b&gt; which is inspired by Philipine myths, well or fall for the fascinating, glittering &lt;b&gt;Dispel Dice&lt;/b&gt; – which almost got me, maybe build a tower with &lt;b&gt;TURRIM Dice&lt;/b&gt; or keep track of your game with the &lt;b&gt;Spin Dice and Gaming Gizmos&lt;/b&gt; counters. There is fascinating stuff like the &lt;b&gt;Tome Tote&lt;/b&gt;, which doubles as book cover and dice tray and very cool &lt;b&gt;Deckboxes&lt;/b&gt; that I actually backed.
There are many, many more very interesting projects, well worth having a look, just see for yourself:
