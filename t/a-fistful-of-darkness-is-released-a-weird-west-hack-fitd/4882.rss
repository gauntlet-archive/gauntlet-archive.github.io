    <description>Not sure if this qualifies for the Hype category but maybe some day.

I&#39;m proud to say that I realeased &quot;A Fistful of Darkness&quot; on itch.io.
https://monkeyecho.itch.io/a-fistful-of-darkness

I hope you like it and have fun playing it.
Thanks to everybody for support, kind words and inspiration. 

-Stefan
P.S. Hope you and your family and friends are healthy in these troubled times.</description>
