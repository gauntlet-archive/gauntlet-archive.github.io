    <description>I&#39;m in need of some game recommendations. I played a ton of heavier games lately, and while I really enjoy them I feel in need of some lighter, funny or even silly games.
Games that I put in this category and which I like a lot are:
Game of Love (Bachelorette hack of Final Girl)
[Behind the Magic](https://randylubin.itch.io/behind-the-magic)
I played both of them quite often and was wondering what other games are out there that will make your belly hurt from laughter :smiley:</description>

              <p>I second the Grant Howitt rec! Sometimes I just pair a premisse of one of his games with the Tearable RPG and it’s a blast.<br>
More recently I loved playing <a href="https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/shitty-adventurers" rel="nofollow noopener">Shitty Adventurers</a> and <a href="https://cprevas.itch.io/vampire-block-party" rel="nofollow noopener">Vampire Block Party</a>, a one page game based on What we do in the shadows.</p>

              <p>A lot of the Grant Howitt one-page games start from a funny premise, carry it through some simple and funny mechanics and result in a good time. I guess most people know Honey Heist pretty well, but Nice Marines, Crash Pandas and Jason Statham’s Big Vacation are other good starting points.</p>
