*No matter how many times you see Mooncore from up high, you always feel something stir inside of you.*

*From up here, it all seems so distant - everything you’ve fought for, everything that was lost. The banners of revolution are meaningless - simply specks of color, if they’re visible at all. The people who live their lives in fear are just colors as they turn on their lights in their homes, and the ever-present purring of your mechanical arm is quieted against the wind’s noise.*

*You wait, knowing that it’s only a matter of time before you see the city’s true colors.*

We will be playing 3 sessions of **Ascendancy**, an in-development Sparked by Resistance RPG about bio-engineered mutant soldiers called Ascended trying to define themselves and survive in a post-revolutionary city that does not trust them. It is a game about identity, rebellion against power structures, and our relationships to others.

The author includes the following content warning:
&gt; Themes of abuse, body horror involving technological augmentation, identity, trauma, political upheaval, and imperialism are all either explicitly intended or heavily implied through the text and the mechanics. The core conceit of Ascendancy is exploring how expectations of those around you can shape you into a different person, and how identity is changed and shaped by others, but the explicit attention to the abusive and manipulative nature of the Ascended’s relationship to the Uplift, as well as the Ascended’s relationship to their own powers may be difficult and traumatic to some.

You can find the beta here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NyegVdK8hvZv8QC_R-Slh4fTn56RgOaMrtTjcbAvdNs/edit?usp=sharing

We will be playing the game in 4 hour sessions, and will be using Script Change by Brie Sheldon (http://www.briecs.com/p/script-change-rpg-tool.html) as well as Lines and Veils for safety.
