    <description>Hello, I am trying to make a list of story games, RPGs, and LARPs designed for children, ideally playable by them without adult help (but that&#39;s not a deal-breaker).I&#39;m not talking about adult or young adult games that can work with children, but games designed with actual children in mind--family friendly games. If you contribute a suggestion I will curate a list in this initial post.  Thanks for your help.

The List:
[Superhero Bakery](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqbj7qsi3ny724y/superhero_bakery_web.pdf?dl=0) (LARP) (Jason Morningstar)
[Let&#39;s Be Dinosaurs](http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2016/Let%27sBeDinosaurs!_Beltran.pdf) (LARP/Story-Game) (Javier P. Beltrán)
[Star Level Ten](http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2016/StarLevel10_Wedig.pdf) (LARP/Story-Game) (Madeline Wedig &amp; Nick) 
[A Crow Funeral](http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2015/CrowFuneral%20ver4_TimothyHutchings.pdf) (LARP) (Tim Hutchings)
[Still Life](http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/Still%20Life.pdf) (LARP) (Wendy Gorman, David Hertz, and Heather Silsbee)
[We Are Roommates Now](http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2016/WeAreRoommatesNow_Gorman.pdf) (LARP) (Wendy Gorman)</description>

              <p>I am playing Offworlders with my 8 year old. She likes it a lot. The Sci-Fi genre has less pre-conceived notions baked in than the fantasy ones and lets you play a wide array of stuff.</p>
<p>She likes watching about different cultures and history on PBS and that comes out a lot in our games. I have an Actual Play post on the RPG chat if you are interested in the expierence.</p>

<p><a href="https://kpetker.itch.io/princess-world-short-story-edition" rel="nofollow noopener">Princess World</a> by Kevin Petker with help/inspiration from his daughter. It’s a modified PbtA game of princesses doing cool things. Because of the vocabulary level on some of the sheets, I think an adult might be needed to explain some things. It is still in development at this point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ardens.org/games/dinosaur-princesses/" rel="nofollow noopener">Dinosaur Princesses</a> by Hamish and Dana Cameron. Along with a fun theme and pretty straightforward rules, character sheets double as coloring book pages. Once you answer a few basic questions for character creation, you can design/color your own dinosaur princess.</p>

              <p>A lot depends on the age of the kids.  For younger kids I might not even have character sheets or rolls.  They just want a cool story and be able to do neat things.  Ask them what they do and tell them what happens.  When my son was in elementary school they would do this on the playground.  Just start telling a story and do stuff.</p>
<p>If you want something a little more rules-based I’ve heard good things about Hero Kids.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/hopeless_wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a>, as you and I have discussed, I’ve written a bunch of games intended for children, but none of my <em>game texts</em> are suitable for children. I would not at all be opposed to someone putting together such a text for one of my games, however.</p>
<p>I should probably put together “As the Worm Turns…” sometime, as I’ve had lots of fun playing that with children.</p>
<p>My own experience as a child mirrors Jason’s somewhat: we played D&amp;D from the start, and we had fun (although it wasn’t always fun!). We had no trouble with complex rules, but we did struggle a lot with social authority issues, railroading, and similar “classic” foibles of traditional roleplaying.</p>
