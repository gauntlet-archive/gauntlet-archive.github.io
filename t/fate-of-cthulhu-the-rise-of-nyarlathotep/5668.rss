    <description>*The Great Old Ones reach out from the future and into their past - our present - corrupting the timeline such that events and individuals turn towards the apocalyptic and lead to their inevitable rise. A small and battered resistance effort mounted by time-travelers and present-day heroes stands in their way. You will play one of those one-way travelers from a dark future or their crucial allies from the present day, working together to save the human race from looming apocalypse. Armed with foreknowledge of Judgment Day, you must succeed at a series of vital missions aimed at restoring hope to the future. But the clock is ticking. The corrupting influence of the Great Old Ones is sure to affect you before the end, twisting you slowly and inexorably into something alien and unrecognizable. Can you defeat the vast unknowable evils of the Great Old Ones before you become a monster yourself?*

**ALL ACCESS DATE IS 4 August 2020**
**5 Thursdays in October at 19:00 (GMT)**
**System:**   **FATE OF CTHULHU** , from Evil Hat productions ... This is a mission based game based on Fate Core with some interesting changes to deal with the corruption spread by the Great Old Ones and how charcater efforts change the future. My only significant modification will be to replace *&#39;I roll 4dF-you roll 4dF&#39;* with an entirely player based mechanic to speed online play.
This is the first of 5 sessions, each scheduled for 3 hours.
Being able to attend all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.
Please note that Session 4 overlaps with the first session of GauntletCon 2020.
**Lowell Francis will be a guest in this series.**
**Pre-game Contact:**  You will be contacted by email about a week before the first session and linked to a Hangouts chat group for the series. A willingness to undertake some character and setting creation via that Hangouts chat before we actually play would be helpfui in ensuring session 1 proceeds swiftly to play.
**Application** : Each session will be recorded using Zoom or StreamYard and permission sought to post them to YouTube.

              <p><strong>Fate of Cthulhu - The Rise of Nyarlathotep (5/5)</strong><br>
Cut to the desert 250 miles NE of Khartoum several months after the last Timeline Event; during which time the missing Avery Quinn makes gets the Glowing Trapezohedron back to the team.  Nessa has spent weeks accumulating as much information on a World Heritage Site destined to host the Rise of Nyarlathotep; Rook steps back and forth in time to make sure the SAS will provide some back-up for an ‘American cultural attache’; and McFee frets about his missing son’s fate while customising a dune buggy.  There’s cultists, old enemies, a Mask of Nyarlathotep, and then … a portal, one young man with no memory, and another who is of little importance … and an Elder Thing …</p>

Nyarlathotep dons the mask of the Dark Pharaoh to make McFee an attractive offer, while Nessa’s suspicions of Avery Quinn turn violent and Rook can’t resist the chance to take a pop at the Great Old One. They wake in their Paris hotel rooms to find Avery, and the Trapezohedron Nyarlathotep wants, missing … then there are mummies, masks and a papyrus scroll … and a pocket dimension …</p>
