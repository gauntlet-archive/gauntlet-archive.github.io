You’ve got a gig three planets away. There is just a handful of you: old friends and new acquaintances, comrades and childhood sweethearts on the open road, the rolling seas, or the endless void.

Time to get going.

ROAD TRIP is a role-playing game about cramming into a vehicle with a few friendly faces and setting off for a distant spot on, or above, the horizon. It’s about all the strange adventures and personal moments that can happen in close quarters and distant lands.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and will be added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).
