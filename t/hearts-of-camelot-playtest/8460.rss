* **Concept** : A game of Arthurian romance, telling tales of battle and heartbreak, in which players take the roles of champions, errants, lieges, paragons, sorcerers, and villains.
* **Aim** : To playtest  **Hearts of Camelot** , by playing to see what happens.
* **Tone** : Exciting and melodramatic.
* **Subject Matter** : Action and (non-explicit) violence. Romance and (non-explicit) sex. A legendary medieval setting, containing feudalism, miracles, and magic. Your heroes can be any race, class, gender, sexuality, and religion. (This is legend, not history, so &quot;historical accuracy&quot; does not apply.) Safety tools (Open-Table, Lines &amp; Veils, and X-Card) will be used.

**This will be a three-player game session. One spot is reserved for D.**

This is a playtest of  **Hearts of Camelot** , a [Hearts of Wulin](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/hearts-of-wulin.html)-inspired game of Arthurian romance. You will create heroes from a selection of playbooks (Champion, Errant, Liege, Paragon, Sorcerer, Villain) and establish Entanglements. I will improvise a story around your characters and their relationships. We will play to see what happens.

We&#39;ll be playing in Camelot&#39;s &quot;Kingdom of Adventures&quot; period. ( *Arthur, an adult, has secured his crown against threats both foreign and domestic. Merlin is missing and presumed dead. The Round Table is firmly established, but one of its knights, Sir Balin, has committed a shameful deed with metaphysical consequences, and now the kingdom is plagued by adventures in need of redress by heroes. Just in time, Lancelot has arrived at Camelot and secured his place as the Round Table&#39;s foremost knight. Arthur and Guinevere rule from Camelot, holding court, rendering judgments, distributing gifts, and assigning quests.* ) This is the default, recommended time period for the game, characterized by adventures and courtship. During this period, heroes have relative liberty to pursue activities of interest to them, without getting swept into the national upheavals of other time periods.

This will be a three-hour session with two 5-minute breaks, hosted on Zoom. The session will not be recorded. Rules will be taught. I’ll email players before the game to confirm attendance, share play materials (a character keeper with a rules summary and playbooks), and provide a Zoom link.

This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

[Session 2](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-NEplO15eVT0_H1DVQ4M): [date=2022-11-12 time=13:01:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2022-11-12 time=16:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]</description>
