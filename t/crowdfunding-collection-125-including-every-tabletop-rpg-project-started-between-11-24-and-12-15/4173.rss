    <description>I present to you the new &lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #125, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/24 and 12/15&lt;/b&gt;.

After I attended Dragonmeet and been to a work related training, I am back with about 40 projects. Sadly, thanks to the timespan, some projects closed before I could report on them and some are quite close to finishing, thus, let’s get to it.

&lt;b&gt;The Children of Eriu&lt;/b&gt; is a new game placed in the setting of Fate of the Norns. It offers a very celtic setting and a very cool fitting tarot deck. Next to a very rich background, stunning illustrations it has an interesting and tested system, which is based on drawing rune stones. The creator Andrew Valkauskas is experienced with delivering projects and I do recommend it highly. If you are looking for a game fitting for the upcoming holidays, that includes the Krampus, take a look at &lt;b&gt;‚TWAS – The Roleplaying Game Before Christmas&lt;/b&gt;. It offers a rules-light system, which you use to play sentinent toys that are out to rescue Santa. The game is done by Jonathan Green and based on the game book by the same name, the idea is neat and the presentation interesting. I do recommend to check it out. If you’ll like something more futuristic, take a look at &lt;b&gt;Retropunk&lt;/b&gt;, which is a cyberpunk game that has a system inspired a bit by PbtA and more by Blades in the Dark. I like the idea and am actually quite very tempted. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Hardboot&lt;/b&gt;, a D&amp;D 5E game, where you’ll play videogame characters who gotta fight. The project doesn’t appear convincing to me and I do would advice caution.
There are plently of other project. For example I am considering the &lt;b&gt;Memento Mori / Memento Vivere&lt;/b&gt; campaign, which might have a small rules-light system to fit. There are beautiful dice like the &lt;b&gt;Solid Brass Rainbow Serpentine Dice by Polyhydra&lt;/b&gt; or those from the &lt;b&gt;LUMO&lt;/b&gt; project.
There are many cool projects that you should check out, just have a look:
