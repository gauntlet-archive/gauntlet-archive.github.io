    <title>Looking For Lady Blackbirds</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-for-lady-blackbirds/8384</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for games that are similar to Lady Blackbird. Here&#39;s my completely arbitrary definition. To be a Lady Blackbird, the game has to: 
+ be a one-shot,
+ use pre-generated characters with build-in relationships; and
+ have a history of great play experiences.

Bonus points if it&#39;s a pdf.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p><strong>Montsegur 1244</strong> fits your criteria, and is an absolutely amazing game.</p>
<p>The mechanics were borrowed in <strong>Witch - The Road to Lindisfarne</strong> and in my own <strong>The Daughters of Verona</strong>.  Both of which also fit your criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Love in the Time of Seid</strong> is very nice too, IMO Jason Morningstar’s best game.</p>

              <p>Ah! Sounds to me like you’re specifically interested in scenarios with a storygame inclination, where the goal is to play out defined characters. Which, to my mind, is is different from a pre-gen. The latter suggests (to me) characters that, at least in principle, you could have built on your own using the system, whereas the storygame angle suggests that their place in the fiction is more important than stats or skills.</p>
<p>If that’s what you have in mind, it may be significantly trickier to find options. Maybe look at the ashcan for Yazeba’s Bed &amp; Breakfast, for a start? <a href="https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/yazeba-ashcan" rel="nofollow noopener">https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/yazeba-ashcan</a></p>

              <p>I recently purchased Seven Wonders from Pelgrane Press. It contains seven stand-alone story games suitable for one-shots. Not all of the games include pregens but the ones that do include relationships with the other characters. Haven’t played nor watched any actual plays so not sure this fits the history of play criteria. From the product page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Different times call for different games</strong><br>
Have you ever wondered…</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>how the children from Narnia coped back in the real world?
what it’s like to voyage into a black hole?
how dystopias are created, and destroyed?
what you would sacrifice to protect your family?
what heroes talk about on the eve of a life-altering battle?
how to defend your village, when your heroes are away?
who protects your home when you’re not looking?</code></pre>
