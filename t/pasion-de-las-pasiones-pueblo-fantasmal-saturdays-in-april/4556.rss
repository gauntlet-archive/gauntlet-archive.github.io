    <description>The long-running telenovela &quot;Pueblo Fantasmal&quot; follows the lives, lies, and loves of the residents of a strange town with a spooky reputation.

You never know what might happen on  *Puebloa Fantasmal.*  They say El Caballero once fought a wolfman. They say El Jefe has thugs who never speak and have strange bolts in their necks. Some have glimpsed La Belleza mysteriously weeping right before a spree of tragic drownings. Some whisper that La Doña has been the town matriarch for longer than anyone can remember, yet she never steps foot in daylight. Sometimes, a never before seen El Gemelo will arrived just after their &#39;twin&#39; breaks a mysterious old mirror.

Come experience all the drama, intrigue, and betrayal of Pasión de las Pasiones (by Brandon Leon-Gambetta) with a twist of the supernatural.

Pasión de las Pasiones is coming to Kickstarter in February, and I&#39;ve decided to celebrate by running a series, using the final published rules, in April.

The PdlP sessions I&#39;ve seen have been  *relatively*  grounded, so I wanted to try getting spooky. You are encouraged to include supernatural elements in your character but please be respectful of Latinx cultures. As a general guideline, don&#39;t involve elements of Afro-Latin spiritual practices (like Santería or Brujería) unless that&#39;s part of your real world cultural heritage.

If you would like to include part of your heritage, that&#39;s great! Please let me know, and we will make all efforts to handle it respectfully.

We will be utilizing safety tools such as the X-Card, script change tools, and lines and veils. You must RSVP for every session you wish to attend but need not attend every session. I do encourage attending as many sessions as you can. The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy will be in effect for the game. The sessions are scheduled for around 3 hours and will be recorded and uploaded if everyone agrees to it.
