          <p>Are your NPC rosters skewing awfully young? Got a dozen Obachans kicking around in your head?  Have I got a Miscellany for you! This Miscellany is called “Three Dozen Notable People over 50.” Submissions need to be a single sentence, or 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p>“Consuelo hasn’t done much fieldwork since that incident in ‘76, but she’s fluent in six modern and three ancient languages and’s seen just about every kind of monster you’re likely to run into out there. Don’t bother asking her what happened though, the story’s different every time.”</p>
<p>“No one loves a well-written clause like the fae, and when they need a contract drawn up or a loophole closed, they turn to Mel Webb. Webb was human at the start, at least, though aging gracefully may be part of their retainer. They’ve been popping up with the same frost white hair and silver-headed cane for at least fifty years now.”</p>
<p>“Apelu Toleafoa was never top of the card, but he’s been with the promotion since it started and trained half the current roster. It’s damn near criminal it took them this long to put him in charge of developmental.”</p>
<p>P.S. If you want to be credited as something other than the name on your forum profile, let me know! DMs here or on Slack (<span class="mention">@ryanm</span>) are fine for that, but please keep submissions in this thread.</p>

          <p>Sister Mary Immaculate is a well-respected mother superior, but her obsession with neatness sometimes rankles the newer sisters. Still sharp as a tack, she rarely discusses life before the convent, refusing to confirm or deny the rumor that she was a silent film starlet before hearing the call of the Lord.</p>

Rowan just makes something to eat from the magic herbs in their garden, listens to whatever needs to be said, and sends the weary traveler onward, hopefully a little lighter than they arrived and with a little luck in their stomach.</p>

          <p>Not many wrestlers achieve superstardom at age 64, but that’s the year Stan Melkewicz debuted his now-legendary announcer personna Professor Turnbuckle. Drawing on his earliest pre-wrestling days as a busboy at a now-long-defunct Catskills comedy club, the offbeat and decidedly promiscuous octogenarian and ‘leading expert in the physics of wrestling’ proved an instant and enduring fan favorite, earning Stan the fame he never found <em>inside</em> the squared circle.</p>

          <p>Lucius was only seen during the day, offering some timely advice to every member of his five generation family. A well kept gentleman appearing no older than sixty, with slight smile and widows peak in his grey hair. No one ever saw Lucius approach, they would hear his gentle steps and suddenly he would be there.</p>

          <p>Peter King is a teacher - English and history, with a passion for poetry and revolutions. He’s one of the good ones, taking care of the kids, offering advice and guidelines and an open ear for anyone. Or at least a limerick, if nothing else helps.<br>
In the holidays, though, he’ll change from his nondescript suits to equally nondescript motorcycle wear, load up on weapons and go monster hunting for fun. None of his students have ever seen the tattoos protecting his skin, or the scar from the times the tattoos weren’t enough.</p>
<p>Rhys is not a young mage anymore. Still, you’d usually think he’s harmless - he loves talking laboriously about magic. Or whisky. Or both - it’s a little hard to tell, really, with his sentences meandering between one topic and the other. Don’t be fooled by this, though. He’s a stone-cold pragmatist willing to make all the hard choices to protect his people, and he throws fireballs or multiple lightning bolts with equal competence.</p>
<p>This is Christine. She is 53 years old, but you don’t see that - with her tanned skin, elegantly blonde hair, smiling brown eyes and impeccable clothing she looks timeless. Christine likes mystery novels, and every time someone talks about zombie apocalypses or other catastophes, she will jokes about eating babies. At they’re wickedly, morbidly funny, her jokes, because who would really eat a baby? Yes, it’s said witches might do that, but who believes in witches, anyway?</p>

Those who come to her with their troubles may be put off by her abrupt laughter and proclamations that they’ve “made a real mess” or “won’t ever find it now” - as if their quest and the very fate of the world were a spilled cup of tea or a lost thimble - but those who stay and listen well may find prophecy in her musings before she shoos them out the door with a vague “see you next time around”.</p>

          <p>He is old enough that if he ever had a name, it is long forgotten, but rumors persist that he was once the greatest assassin ever and led an extraordinarily lethal collective of killers for hire. And while most of the young people who went to him seeking training in deadly arts came back scoffing at the idea that he was ever anything but a doddering old fool prone to over-watering plants and collecting stray kittens, he invited a few inside his home and they were never seen again. They couldn’t all have run away; who knows what became of them?</p>
<p>Graysister Jez may not have been the best mechanic anyone had ever seen at the monastery commonly known as The Garage, but she was more than good enough to keep the Wasteland Riders’ choppers in good condition (those monks were <em>not</em> known for their repair skills). Anyone who criticized her usually wound up with a mouthful of broken teeth, because she wrapped her fists in broken lengths of motorcycle chain and didn’t pull punches.</p>
<p>Alby was the camp cook, always tending a stewpot hanging over the fire. Somehow, no matter what ingredients the scavengers had managed to find, the stew tasted the same.</p>
<p>Erys wasn’t quite a chirurgeon or a wardoc, but had been doing this so long that stopping the bleeding was second nature and was always a welcome hand when you were tracking down apostos and herets with access to kinweps. The enweps cauterized as they burned through you so they either killed you instantly or left you in fighting shape, but the kinweps took you out of commission and could kill you fast if they nicked something vital. And if Erys needed to work on you, there usually wasn’t time for niceties like anes or lido - it was gonna hurt.</p>

          <p>Dan is an octogenarian who plays video games on YouTube. He also has several blogs about life hacks, politics and other things. What people don’t know: Dan is a first generation hacker, and he’s never let up. He knows the internet inside and out, and he needs to: He’s approaching ninety, and his body won’t make it much longer. So he needs to upload his conciousness, because there is absolutely no alternative. And he’s making progress: If you look at the web of connections between websites, they resemble the neural structures of Dan’s brain. Only lately, he has begun to suspect that he is not the only one doing this …</p>

          <p>Grandma swears humans built the rust pilgrim, though its metal body looks nothing like ours. Most everyone that’s met Ol’ Red agrees, see, 'cause it acts like us… or rather how we wish we were: kind to the downtrodden, defender of the oppressed, the last wholly good person left in the wastes.</p>
