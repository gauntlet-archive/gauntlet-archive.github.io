    <title>Codex - Gold Miscellany</title>

    <description>Are your NPC rosters skewing awfully young? Got a dozen Obachans kicking around in your head?  Have I got a Miscellany for you! This Miscellany is called “Three Dozen Notable People over 50.” Submissions need to be a single sentence, or 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you&#39;re agreeing to let us use it (you&#39;ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Here are some examples: 

“Consuelo hasn’t done much fieldwork since that incident in ‘76, but she’s fluent in six modern and three ancient languages and’s seen just about every kind of monster you’re likely to run into out there. Don’t bother asking her what happened though, the story’s different every time.”

“No one loves a well-written clause like the fae, and when they need a contract drawn up or a loophole closed, they turn to Mel Webb. Webb was human at the start, at least, though aging gracefully may be part of their retainer. They’ve been popping up with the same frost white hair and silver-headed cane for at least fifty years now.”

“Apelu Toleafoa was never top of the card, but he’s been with the promotion since it started and trained half the current roster. It’s damn near criminal it took them this long to put him in charge of developmental.”

P.S. If you want to be credited as something other than the name on your forum profile, let me know! DMs here or on Slack (@ryanm) are fine for that, but please keep submissions in this thread.

              <p>Me and Luis work in the same garage. I’m pushing 40, and he’s gotta have like 20 years on me. Nice guy, don’t know him well. There was that one time when a weird-looking lady brought in a vintage VW Beetle with no plates, and she asked speficifally for Luis. Before he shooed me away, I swear I heard him whistle and say something like, “A QX-48 Timerider! What a beauty!” After I came back from my smoke break, the car and the lady were gone. When I asked, Luis just smiled and shrugged.</p>

<p>Don’t let her grandmotherly little-old-lady demenanor get you to drop your guard. Minnie Cho is tough as nails and is the most brilliant litigator any courtroom in this city has ever seen! She’s been at this game since before your mother was born, and believe me: She knows how to play it better than you do. If you’re up against her, I would advise you to settle.</p>

One of them turned to fire a pot-shot at the black-masked stranger, but she won the draw with her silver pistol, shooting the gun right out of the bandit’s hand. “All right, citizens! Bert Greene and his men won’t be bothering you again!” She pulled the reins and her black horse reared as she shouted “HEY-YA MIDNIGHT!!” She rode into the sunset, long silver hair streaming behind her. Someone asked, “Who was that masked woman?” An old-timer replied, “I ain’t seen her in 30 years, but the Lone Rider is back again!”</p>

And while most of the young people who went to him seeking training in deadly arts came back scoffing at the idea that he was ever anything but a doddering old fool prone to over-watering plants and collecting stray kittens, he invited a few inside his home and they were never seen again.

<p>Graysister Jez may not have been the best mechanic anyone had ever seen at the monastery commonly known as The Garage, but she was more than good enough to keep the Wasteland Riders’ choppers in good condition (those monks were <em>not</em> known for their repair skills). Anyone who criticized her usually wound up with a mouthful of broken teeth, because she wrapped her fists in broken lengths of motorcycle chain and didn’t pull punches.</p>

<p>Erys wasn’t quite a chirurgeon or a wardoc, but had been doing this so long that stopping the bleeding was second nature and was always a welcome hand when you were tracking down apostos and herets with access to kinweps. The enweps cauterized as they burned through you so they either killed you instantly or left you in fighting shape, but the kinweps took you out of commission and could kill you fast if they nicked something vital. And if Erys needed to work on you, there usually wasn’t time for niceties like anes or lido - it was gonna hurt.</p>

              <p>You’ll find Neal drinking coffee with a few other old boys at the local cafe. Calloused and a little bit stooped from years of manual labor, he spends his time complaining about politicians, taxes, and what the young people are getting up to these days. He’s often mistrustful of outsiders, but his passion for birding leads to a surprisingly wide array of contacts.</p>
<p>As their name tag suggests, Faze staffs the Reference Desk at the Occluded Library. Respectful patrons who speak quietly and listen patiently will benefit from Faze’s insightful (if laconic) commentary on almost any topic. Despite their small stature and advanced age, Faze will not hesitate to defend the Rules of the Library from would-be book thieves, loud talkers, and other miscreants.</p>

              <p>Sun Xi has lived his whole life in the bustling metropolis, and is well known for being an impeccably dressed and attentive patron of the arts. His home is a micellany of those who have benefited from his patronage, and if you attend one of his parties and offer a fitting tribute to his walls (a famed painting, a rare recording, even a performance) he might reward you with a peek into his treasury.</p>
<p>James Duncan has lived through more wars and trenches than he can count. Missing three fingers, one ear, and an eye, Jamie is as grizzled as they come. Don’t let that stop you from seeking out his wisdom, as he has remained good friends with all his wartime pals, even after they’ve left the land of the living.</p>
<p>While well known as Dame Geordie, an iconique one hit punk rock wonder from some years back, the real Georgette Blomgren is a kickin’ retiree with a green thumb many consider a wonder of the gardening world. Don’t forget to read the signs in her garden carefully, as an unfortunate typo has led to more than one deceased fan.</p>

Those who come to her with their troubles may be put off by her abrupt laughter and proclamations that they’ve “made a real mess” or “won’t ever find it now” - as if their quest and the very fate of the world were a spilled cup of tea or a lost thimble - but those who stay and listen well may find prophecy in her musings before she shoos them out the door with a vague “see you next time around”.</p>

              <p>Peter King is a teacher - English and history, with a passion for poetry and revolutions. He’s one of the good ones, taking care of the kids, offering advice and guidelines and an open ear for anyone. Or at least a limerick, if nothing else helps.<br>
In the holidays, though, he’ll change from his nondescript suits to equally nondescript motorcycle wear, load up on weapons and go monster hunting for fun. None of his students have ever seen the tattoos protecting his skin, or the scar from the times the tattoos weren’t enough.</p>
<p>Rhys is not a young mage anymore. Still, you’d usually think he’s harmless - he loves talking laboriously about magic. Or whisky. Or both - it’s a little hard to tell, really, with his sentences meandering between one topic and the other. Don’t be fooled by this, though. He’s a stone-cold pragmatist willing to make all the hard choices to protect his people, and he throws fireballs or multiple lightning bolts with equal competence.</p>
<p>This is Christine. She is 53 years old, but you don’t see that - with her tanned skin, elegantly blonde hair, smiling brown eyes and impeccable clothing she looks timeless. Christine likes mystery novels, and every time someone talks about zombie apocalypses or other catastophes, she will jokes about eating babies. At they’re wickedly, morbidly funny, her jokes, because who would really eat a baby? Yes, it’s said witches might do that, but who believes in witches, anyway?</p>
