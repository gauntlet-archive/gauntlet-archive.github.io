    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/dungeon-with-kids/2433</link>
    <description>So two questions. Background is solo play with 8 year old. 

Maze Rats or World of Dungeon (Dungeon World is a little too tricky). 

Second - for World of Dungeon any new classes or setting info for kiddos. I am thinking something like StarDust and the Wall, and the character explores into a new realm. 

Thanks and Peace,

              <p>I ended up going with home brew rules Coffee for this. I set up a situation of brother and sister in a town like Wall from Stardust. Kiddos wake up and all the adults are gone and the portal to fey realm is open. A little bit of a magic treehouse and Stardust vibe to it.</p>

We started playing DnD5e this January.<br>
I was surprised how fast today’s kids pick up concepts like HP,  armorclass etc. when they played some form of video games (e. g. minecraft) before.</p>
<p>He was interested in stuff from the monster manual, so we played no special “kids friendly” scenario. I helped him getting his character going. From there on, he played autonomous.</p>
<p>Second session we switched and he was GMing.</p>

              <p>Probably not what you’re after, but I would suggest checking out <a>Dungeons and Bananas</a>, which are just a few pages long. It’s not a typical roleplaying game, but a collaborative experience.</p>
<p>• Takes 1-2 hours to play. Enough for a child’s attention span.<br>
• Lets the kid be creative. The whole game is about challenging the participants’ creativity.<br>
• Is fairly non-sensitive to gonzo. Which eight year olds tend to be at time.</p>
