    <description>
Looked around, didn&#39;t see a thread besides for @MrTrollhands&#39; Candlelight thread. 

So... who&#39;s working on a Rooted in Trophy game/hack?

[**Here&#39;s a link to the Trophy SRD.**](https://trophyrpg.com/system/)

---------------

Read up on the system today and found it pretty interesting! I&#39;m trying to ween myself from game design stuff for the month but I keep coming back to these rules light narrative games that are just oh so fun and easy to hack. I whipped this up tonight:

**[BLACK FRIDAY](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfc8syv20VwgqrOa027_0HD3psVkpgUb1TFSvgPl37g/edit)**

**Black Friday** is a tabletop roleplaying game of desperate shoppers on the worst retail day of 2006. It is a one-shot hack of Trophy Black and deals with similar themes of psychological horror and betrayal. As the shoppers roam deeper into the endless halls of the Sultan Hills Shopping Center, it does everything it can to tear them apart and turn them into the voracious monsters known as *people*.

              <p>What a cool idea! It’s perfectly fine by us so long as you don’t sell it. We recommend making the pips for the 1-3 hollow, solid for 4-5, and the antlers logo for 6. For gold dice, every side should be blank, except for one that has the Trophy Gold logo.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if this is the right thread but I’m putting together some trophy style dice for Tabletop Simulator. If it is OK with the creators of the game I will make them available for anyone to use.</p>
<p>I think TTS is such a great platform for games with dice mechanics, especially games like trophy when there is a certain gamble mechanic.</p>
