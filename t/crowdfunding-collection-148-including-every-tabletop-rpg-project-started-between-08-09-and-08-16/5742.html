          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/08/17/crowdfunding-collection-148/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #148, including every tabletop rpg project started between 08/16 and 08/09</b></a>.</p>
<p>The weather cooled down and thus I am back to a somewhat regular weekly schedulded. Despite the recent wordpress changes to the editor, which are hell. Without further ado, let us have a look at the current 36 projects.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fascinating, new game <b>Gun&amp;Slinger</b>. The game for one GM and two players has one player play the „Slinger“ and one player play the „Gun“. Like the literal shooting iron. Though, given that the mallable setting is post-magic, the gun actually is sentient, still can do magic, and is able to intimidate people on its own. Combined with a card based system I am quite intruiged and consider backing it. As an afficinado of Urban Fantasy I did actually back <b>The Great American Witch</b>. Just as it suggests in the title, the game has you assume the role of a witch. With the choice of all kind of witches. Necromantic witches, herbal witches, psychic witches,… it is a cool concept, especially if you like the WoD. Though check out their video (which got me hooked). The system, that utilizes elements of PbtA and „The Great American Novel“ seems cool as well. <b>Mnemonic</b> offers another fascinating twist, in that you’ll be playing „Weaver“ who shape the narratives of heroes and thus form a sort of canon. I like the idea, and you can checkout the core system for free. Then there’s Fria Ligan who are reviving <b>Twilight 2000</b> with a new edition. The game puts you in a grim &amp; gritty World War III scenario. The system is a 2d6 variant of the MY0 enginge and the project is quite popular. If you are a fan of the WW III setting, the illustrations or the system, take a look. Though personally I don’t like the WW III setting.<br>
If you like really classic fantasy, take a look at <b>Old-School Essentials: Advanced Fantasy</b>. Basically AD&amp;D OSR, if my guess is right? If you like classic fantasy or the OSR, take a look. I think it would be right up your ally. If you are interested in Sword &amp; Sorcery fantasy, checkout the second edition of <b>Sword Noir</b>. It looks quite solid.<br>
If, in these times of the corona plague, you are looking for a sole game,… <b>Dungeonrunnner: The Companion &amp; Immortal Set</b> seems cool. It might be more a solo dungeon crawler than a gamebook or a tabletop rpg, but I think it veers close enough to warrant a mention.<br>
There are many more cool projects. There’s <b>Wondrous Expeditions</b> which will support / aid your world building efforts, there are D&amp;D 5E adventures to be had in <b>The Dream Prison</b>, the <b>Ice-covered Lava DICE</b> look cool, as do the <b>D20 Sharp Edges Inclusions with Star / Moon</b> dice, which you might put into the stylish and customizable <b>Token Sesame</b> container.<br>
These, and many more cool projects you’ll find here:</p>
