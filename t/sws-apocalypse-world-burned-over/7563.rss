## *Something&#39;s wrong with the galaxy and I don&#39;t know what it is.*

It used to be better, of course, it did, or so they say. In the golden age of legend, with the Republic and the Jedi Order, when there was enough to eat and enough hope, when people could lift their eyes and see beyond the horizon, beyond the blazing light of two suns. Children were born happy and some even grew up rich.

Now? Wretched, baking desert. Sand people, Hutt crimelords, no account smugglers. And to make it even worse, kriffing pod racing.

And you, who are you? This is what we&#39;ve **got**, yes. What are you going to **make** of it?

*I&#39;m running a five-shot of Apocalypse World: Burned Over (v2021). A reskin to Star Wars, set on Tatooine, but trust, friend. It&#39;ll be just as harsh as AW can get, so be warned.*
