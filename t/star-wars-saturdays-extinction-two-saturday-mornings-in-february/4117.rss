After the death of Palpatine, Grand Moff Zsinj was recognized by many as the most powerful of the post-Imperial warlords. In fact, his official title of &quot;Warlord of the Empire&quot; popularized the term &quot;warlord&quot; for the renegades who broke away from the crumbling Empire, when in the initial chaos following the Battle of Endor he proclaimed loyalty to the Empire and used his legal title to foster an appearance of legitimacy.

In this two-session series, you&#39;ll be playing as an squad of Ex-Imperial Stormtroopers and their support team, the backbone of the warlord&#39;s army fighting to keep control of the Quelii Oversector against other warlords, the forces of the New Republic, and indigenous populaces. 

In this game, we&#39;ll deal with the idea of being part of a military force on the other side of &quot;the good guys&quot;. Your characters aren&#39;t evil, they&#39;re caught in the remnants of an Empire that never gave them a choice to be anything other than its soldiers. During character creation, we&#39;ll how each PC became a soldier in the Empire, and what they thought when they first heard Palpatine was dead.

Are you bad guys? Are you misled? Are you misunderstood? Let&#39;s play to find out!

EXTINCTION is a stand alone RPG of Sci-Fi survival horror made with the *Black Hack* RPG inspired by movies like *Alien*, *Outland* and *Event Horizon*.
