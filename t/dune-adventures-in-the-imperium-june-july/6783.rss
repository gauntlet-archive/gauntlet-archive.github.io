***Note: for the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you joined the Gauntlet in the last six months. I’m also reserving a seat.***

This is for four Thursday evening (US) sessions of *Dune: Adventures in the Imperium*. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged, but not required. Right now, I’m posting the June sessions, but there will be five more in July. Players in these sessions will have right of first refusal for the July sessions so plan accordingly. Rules will be taught and we will be playing from basic pdf. In session one we’ll discuss tone, develop a noble house for our PCs, create characters, and get to playing.

***Open RSVP begins 4/6 for these sessions***

*The Dune: Adventures in the Imperium roleplaying game takes you into a far future where fear is the mind killer so be sure to keep your wits about you. The Imperium is a place of deadly duels, feudal politics and mysterious abilities in a universe where a blade can change the fortunes of millions. Build your House, carve your place in the universe or rebuild an ancient lineage and fight for the Imperial throne.*

**CW: political oppression, religion, slavery—mostly as background elements**

Note: While  *Dune* features in the name, we won’t necessarily be set there. We’ll be exploring the broader universe and themes. Note: familiarity with the source material is not necessary.

Each session will run 2 1/2 to 3 hours. If you sign up and your attendance or RSVP changes, please also send me a message at edige23 at gmail. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. We will use Zoom for our sessions. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.
