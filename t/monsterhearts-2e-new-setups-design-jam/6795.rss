*This is a session to brainstorm and test out ideas to produce different approaches to connecting the player characters for a game of Monsterhearts. No game will actually be played, but we will hopefully trial a few different approaches to setting up the characters.*

Monsterhearts is one of my favourite ttrpgs and one of my most played and MCed. A recurring theme, however, in the games I&#39;ve run is that players often create their PCs with quite loose or recent connections to each other. Small town high schools are a very common setting, and yet players veer towards PCs who often have never even spoken to each other before. Of course, this is for the good reason that it&#39;s easier to play characters in the early stages of a relationship and that&#39;s absolutely fine. But it does leave a lot of other relationships by the way side. PCs who were best friends as tweens but aren&#39;t any more. A PC who has spent years hating another, only to then discover an attraction to them. PCs who have been best friends since they were toddlers but now one of them is going through some kind of monstrous change.

The purpose of this session is to brainstorm some ideas of how to encourage players to create characters who have these longer term connections with other PCs and how we can support them build a shared history so that their relationship isn&#39;t forgotten in play.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours over Discord audio chat. It will be not be recorded.

I am running this event on 2 consecutive Saturdays. There&#39;s no requirement to come to both. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.
