**Please only sign up if you&#39;re interested in playtesting! Your feedback will be essential, but I can&#39;t guarantee this will be an absolutely fun experience. I will do my best though!**

This session is scheduled for 3 hours. I will email everyone a week ahead. Sessions will be recorded through Streamyard for reference, but only released for public consumption if all players consent.

Being able to attend all sessions would be ideal, but is not required! You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Please note ***Angels of the Arcana*** is currently in playtest!

***Several light years away from the closest planet, The Tower spins slowly in space. The Tower is a prison, full of the Punished. The sacred algorithms of heaven teleport those who are beyond redemption, and the Angels of the Arcana preside over each ward. Except for hundreds of years now, a glitch has corrupted the algorithm. Hundreds of innocents are transported and made to suffer.***

***The High Priestess, an AI of the Tower, reaches out across the universe and seeks help. Can you survive the treacherous purgatories of The Tower? And if you don&#39;t, what terrible and beautiful thing will you become? Can you amass power, beseeching to fate, without waking the Watchful Eye and burning everyone and everything in the Tower?***

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
