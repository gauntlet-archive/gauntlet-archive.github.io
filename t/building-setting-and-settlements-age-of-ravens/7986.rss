    <description>In the new Gauntlet Blog post I talk about collaborative community building in rpgs and look at how some recent games handle that.

              <p>I love games with (or about!) collaborative map-building! Just the mention of “settlement building” makes me think of the <em>Iron Edda</em> collection of games by Tracy Barnett. (I like <em><a href="https://theothertracy.itch.io/iron-edda-accelerated" rel="nofollow noopener">Iron Edda Accelerated</a></em>, personally.) The process probably varies across different iterations of the game, but all games begin with the generation of the party’s holdfast. Holdfast creation is a strongly structured process involving answering randomly chosen prompt questions from a big table, with the answers represented by additions to the holdfast map. The set collection of questions means certain setting elements recur in all <em>Iron Edda</em> games, but the building process ensures that every holdfast is still unique to that table.</p>
<p>As far as continuing engagement and development with a collaboratively built locale, though, I always think of Phil Vecchione’s <em><a href="https://www.encodeddesigns.com/h2o/" rel="nofollow noopener">Hydro Hacker Operatives</a></em> (currently available as an <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/248998/Hydro-Hacker-Operatives--Ashcan-Edition" rel="nofollow noopener">ashcan</a>). The Neighborhood is a central feature of play, and not only is it created with collaborative map-building at the beginning (and the map is continually updated over the course of play), but the Neighborhood also gets its own playbook and moves, takes on projects/renovations, and manages a stockpile of the game narrative currency, oh-so-precious water. Probably my favorite part, though, is character retirement, at which point the retiree becomes a “neighborhood icon,” a fixture in the neighborhood, and the mechanical impact is the Neighborhood’s playbook adding a new custom move based on that character’s legacy. Good stuff!</p>
