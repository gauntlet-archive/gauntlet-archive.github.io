    <description>We will create characters and run the incursion  *Sea of Dust*  by Brian Bình. This will be a 3-part series. Attendance at all three sessions encouraged.

*The Sea of Fallen Jewels was a cool and tranquil inland sea which mirrored the night sky with an island for every star. Common folk lived peaceful lives as fishers and simple craft glided on the glassy sea among myriad isles. Calm waters and clear skies made an idyllic retreat where the elite maintained private villas. Over a century ago, the rivers that fed the sea stopped flowing. Some were dammed to power mills, diverted to irrigate fields, or lost underground when disasters split the earth. The sea shrank year after year becoming increasingly briny and stagnant. The glitterati stopped coming, abandoned villas crumbled with disuse, and the fisher folk moved away. The sea became a salt encrusted wasteland, all but forgotten until recently when a set of antique books including an old ship’s log appeared on the auction block.*

*The log detailed the final voyage of the Moon Princess, a yacht carrying supplies and personal effects from a noble’s island villa in the Sea of Fallen Jewels. The log recorded that the ship sank while anchored near the island’s harbor in a sudden storm. Two hands escaped. The second half of the book is a journal and notes written by a lost explorer who discovered the log in the villa. The anonymous explorer was ill and planned to recuperate, resupply, and return for the treasure. The journal abruptly ends with a note about making camp by a dry river that leads to the old sea basin.*

*The treasure-hunters believe they have discovered which river was the site of the journalist’s last entry and seek to salvage treasures from the wreck of the Moon Princess. There are other interested parties that also seek her so time is of the essence.*

I will send a reminder 1 week before the session.
