    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/08/09/crowdfunding-collection-147/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #147, including every tabletop rpg project started between 07/26 and 08/09&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Back after two weeks and admist a summerly heatwave, I can report that there are about 69 projects started, which I like to present to you in this collection.

Let’s get started with &lt;b&gt;XII: Inner Demons&lt;/b&gt;, an urban fantasy rpg, in which the players set out to prevent an apocalypse due to happen in twelve days by the arrival of an arch demon. The game looks nice and presents a setting made for small campaigns with a distinct ending. I recommend checking the playtest at DTRPG and having a look. If you are a fan of time travelling Science Fiction, with open campaigns, check out &lt;b&gt;Zoetrope&lt;/b&gt;. The game by Dane Asmunds is fully card based, which means you’ll use the cards instead of dice and for describing your character. I backed Moth Children from him and do recommend having a look at this project. Travelling back in time to the glorious 70s to 80s you might like to check out &lt;b&gt;Glam Metal Monster Hunter&lt;/b&gt;. The micro RPG zine offers a game about Neon Knights and Denim demons and uses a small d6 based system. Cute. Another cute concept offers &lt;b&gt;Magic School Mystery&lt;/b&gt;, basically all about juveline adventures at the titular magic school. A somewhat magical school is as well the setting of &lt;b&gt;Preparing for Paris&lt;/b&gt;. A game in which you will play personified sports, going through some high school drama while trying to qualify themselves for the Paris olympics. Which does sound fun and neu.
&lt;b&gt;Wanderhome&lt;/b&gt; at the otherhand is a pastoral fantasy game about travelling animal folk. The serene game about travelling through various seasons, uses an unique game engine inspired by No Dice, No Masters. The designer, Jay Dragon, has Kickstarter and RPG design experience with Sleepaway and I would recommend having a look at Wanderhome. The &lt;b&gt;Dames of Asstoria&lt;/b&gt; offers a more traditional RPG game. You’ll be playing girl monsters on their adventures. The adventures aim at being PG-13 and using a d100 system. An even more traditional game is &lt;b&gt;The Majestic Fantasy RPG&lt;/b&gt;. You can use it as a standalone system, or as an sourcebook for Sword and Sorcery.
The game &lt;b&gt;Cthulhu Parlour’s „Hotel Lovecraft“&lt;/b&gt; mixes roleplaying game, boardgame and gamebook elements with some theater elements. It thus can’t be called a straight up rpg, but I think it is an interesting project. You’ll find that &lt;b&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade Rivals&lt;/b&gt; isn’t a rpg at all, but an expandable card game based on the prominent ttrpg IP. I think it is super cool, backed it and do recommend that you check it out.
There are many more cool projects, like the &lt;b&gt;Svilland&lt;/b&gt; setting for D&amp;D 5E, the sourcebook Guide to Kroma for traveling in games or the &lt;b&gt;Chewer of Fingers&lt;/b&gt; adventures. There are the beautiful &lt;b&gt;Koi-waii Dice&lt;/b&gt; and the newest &lt;b&gt;Elder Dice: Shards of Illumination&lt;/b&gt; project. You’ll find the &lt;b&gt;Dark Art Book and Cards&lt;/b&gt; ~ tarot cards ~ along with an interpretation aid for D&amp;D and the fluffly &lt;b&gt;Tiny RPG Universe Plushies&lt;/b&gt;.
