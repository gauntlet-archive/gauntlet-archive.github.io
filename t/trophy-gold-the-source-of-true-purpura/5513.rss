Public Access time for this session is [date=2020-07-02 time=16:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;].

Trophy is a game of desperate adventurers; treasure hunters who must brave the depths of the world to recover treasure and pay their debts. We will be running through the module The Source of True Purpura - one of the submissions to the Trophy Gold writing contest.

This is a run of 4 sessions for 3 players. Attendance at all four sessions is highly recommended but not required.

You can find more information about Trophy at https://trophyrpg.com/. The rules of the game will be taught, no prior knowledge is necessary. We will be using the Kickstarter released rules and the preview Hearthfire ruleset (or the final Hearthfire rules if Codex: Hearthfire is released before the session).

This game will take place over Zoom. It will be recorded and shared with player permission.

## Content Warnings and Safety Tools

This module may include the following topics. We can use Lines and Veils to mitigate some of these if necessary, but by default these will be in play:

* Graphic descriptions of injury or violence
* Desperation and obsession

We will be using Lines and Veils, Script Change, the X card, and the Open Door policy. All of these will be explained at the beginning of the session. This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
