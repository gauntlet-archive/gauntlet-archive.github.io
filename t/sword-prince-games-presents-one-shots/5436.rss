All games will use **Safety tools** : We will be using script change, x-card, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).</description>
