<p>I think I’m still searching for the “perfect” version of a PbtA-style emergent narrative/dice system with unifying moves, freeform classes (like Knave) and crunch-free gameplay that doesn’t sacrifice story or lethality. So far, I keep coming back to DW or my own One Shot World for running OSR modules for players who want less lethality and more story, and Into The Odd or Knave for those that don’t.</p>

<p>Edited:  <a class="mention" href="/u/diogo_nogueira">@Diogo_Nogueira</a>: I see this is the deal of the day on dtrpg.  Sell me on it!  The descriptions I have seen are a bit confusing to me:  D&amp;D 5e meets OD&amp;D meets Fate that without leveling and is somehow rules light is confusing to me.  Do you have a better description?</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p><em>Knave</em> is a brilliant distillation of key old school tropes, but manages to keep that retroclone/D&amp;D feel. Ben M. went through and retooled a lot of the key concepts like Ability Defense, stats (WIS is used for Ranged Attacks! No more dump stats!), all while keeping close compatibility with old-school modules.</p>
<p>He also introduced a simple (and flexible) inventory system that keeps crunch down, while letting the players play without classes. Do you want to know three spells, but also wield a sword? No problem! Want to change that later? No problem! If a group of players wants a mixture of problem solving/critical thinking but with the ability to shuffle their character around a bit, it’s my first choice.</p>
<p><em>Into The Odd/Electric Bastionland</em> is unique. It takes core OSR concepts like lethality and problem-solving to a whole new level, while at the same time, establishes character purpose with an imposed setting. No to-hit rolls: everyone just does damage - watch out! Three stats for everything a character might do; arcanum for magic, party debt as a reason for dungeon crawling. Even if you don’t play ItO, Chris M.'s blog posts are well worth reading, both for the player and the GM. I find the simplicity and “high-lethality” (Chris hates when we say that) very attractive, and rolling up a character randomly makes it easy to see them killed, and fun to create anew. It’s explicitly <em>not</em> a D&amp;D clone, and that’s what I like about it.</p>
<p><em>Troika!</em> is a different beast entirely. Much like its predecessor Fighting Fantasy, Troika is like D&amp;D through a Science Fantasy funhouse mirror. It uses Skill points and random character backgrounds to create a totally new way to game; and like others have said the backgrounds make the game. I love seeing what players do with it! It’s also been referred to as “hipster planescape” and based on the book art (I have the PDF of the successful KS, still waiting on a print copy) I can see why. Also, the initiative system is bananas; players and enemies put tokens in a bag and… the GM pulls out either who goes next, or if the round ends. Very weird and difficult to predict combat! Finally, the inventory system is fascinating; you have to place easier-to-reach or smaller items on top, and depending on the speed at which you’re looking for an item, you might not succeed at finding it!</p>
<p>Finally, I combine Vagabonds of Dyfed, World of Dungeons and Freebooters into one pile, because although they all have different approaches to OSR gameplay, they all owe allegiance to Dungeon World and other PbtA games. Honestly, whenever I run one of these systems I feel like I could achieve the same effect with Dungeon World + Hard Moves, <em>except</em> for players that don’t like fiddly bits (like Moves, Playbooks etc). In that case, Vagabonds is probably the best choice.</p>
<p><em>Vagabonds</em> is pretty rules-lite, but has enough meat to “feel” like a full game, while WoDu is… well, two pages. Both are great, and both do pretty well at achieving their aims. Vagabonds feels incomplete to me, though: I keep buying the supplements, but they don’t really add to the game all that much, while WoDu and its variants are <em>too</em> lean for my generic fantasy tastes. Freebooters does its job with aplomb, I think; I haven’t ran 2e yet but I’ve read through it. I’m very excited: it feels like Jason took Freebooters 1e and Perilous Wilds and made a complete package out of them.</p>
<p>So… yeah that was a lot of rambling; my apologies. I think I’m still searching for the “perfect” version of a PbtA-style emergent narrative/dice system with unifying moves, freeform classes (like Knave) and crunch-free gameplay that doesn’t sacrifice story or lethality. So far, I keep coming back to DW or my own One Shot World for running OSR modules for players who want less lethality and more story, and Into The Odd or Knave for those that don’t.</p>

              <p>I just ran a couple sessions of Bloat Games upcoming “The Blackest Death” which take Whitebox and removes leveling and adds in ‘AND/BUT’ to the success/failure rolls on the d20 by having your roll an additional d6 and on a one you add in negative and on a 6 you add in positive.  I was running Tomb of the Serpent King and the players enjoyed it.<br>
Other systems I’ve used and enjoy are Troika!, Into the Odd, Scarlet Heroes (for 2 or less players) and BX Essentials.  BX Essentials replaced LotFP as the go to BX D&amp;D rule set.</p>

              <p>The few times I’ve facilitated OSR games, it’s been with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knave - Very easy to use, and to teach new players. I used it for one of my previous F2F groups, and they responded well to it. It’s an easy project to hack too, since the rules are very streamlined.</li>
<li>Vagabonds of Dyfed - Stand in a nice middle point for me. They give me, and my players, more to work with than WoDu does, but keeps many of the OSR staples that I like.</li>

<p>I’ve read the Black Hack 2e, and I’m very interested in running it someday. It’s mechanics seem fun, but I Haven’t found a book to use it with, just yet.</p>
