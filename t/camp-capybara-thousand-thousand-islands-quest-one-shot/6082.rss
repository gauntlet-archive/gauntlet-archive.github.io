    <title>[Camp Capybara] Thousand Thousand Islands - Quest One-Shot</title>

    <description># **This is a practice event for Camp Capybara only**

**This will be a one-shot of Thousand Thousand Islands via Quest!**  You do not need to be familiar with the game, I&#39;m happy to teach you!

**Quest uses a relaxed and flexible rule set that allows players to focus on the story they want to tell. Our system only has a few things you need to learn to get started, and reading the basics take** **s most players about 20 minutes.**


A THOUSAND THOUSAND ISLANDS
A porous, patchwork reality -- where rice grows in blood-red paddies, where princesses romance their spears, where it is a bad idea to mispronounce a crocodile’s name.

A THOUSAND THOUSAND ISLANDS is a series of zines, designed for use in fantasy adventure tabletop RPGs. Ongoing since 2017, this project draws from the overlapping material cultures, lived stories, and mythistories of that region of the world variously called Indochina, Suvarnabhumi, and the Nusantara -- Southeast Asia.
