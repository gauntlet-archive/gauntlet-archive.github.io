    <title>13th Age: Shards of the Broken Sky</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/13th-age-shards-of-the-broken-sky/7241</link>
    <description>This is for seven sessions of *13th Age* running Thursdays in October and November. Characters will begin at 2nd level—classes from the core book and *13 True Ways* are available (with the exception of the Necromancer and Occultist). We will be playing from the *Shards of a Broken Sky* campaign published by Pelgrane. This is set in *13th Age’s* Dragon Empire setting. One seat is being held for Darin.

General RSVPs open 8/5.

*When the flying realm of Vantage crashes to earth in the Dragon Empire, a long-kept secret is revealed: it was the control point for magical wards that kept a dozen ancient evils in check.*

*The icons have offered you rival opportunities for glory, plunder, and/or heroic sacrifice in Vantage. Will you rescue its survivors? Restore its magical wards? Or loot everything that isn’t nailed down while trying to stay one step ahead of the apocalypse?*

Rules will be taught. You’re welcome to put together your character ahead of time (once we’ve confirmed class picks). Alternately I can build it and you can tweak the choices. If you don’t have a copy of  *13th Age*, there’s a good SRD out for it (and it’s available on the Humble Bundle as of this writing). Racial feats are permitted, but anyone can choose to take any one of them to define their heritage. You will assign a +2 bonus to a stat of your pick, rather than be limited by the racial bonuses in the rules.

We will be using Roll20 for maps and character keeper—it’s just easier that way. You can use that roller or another. But we will be using Zoom for the video meeting. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct ](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
