You are squires on the cusp of knighthood, venturing into the treacherous Bleakwood on a quest to prove yourselves worthy and discover the elusive Tower Perilous. What wrongs will you right and lessons will you learn along the way?

**Vow of the Knight-Aspirants**  is a PbtA game of fantasy adventure, inspired by Arthurian legends, fairy tales, and  *Magic: The Gathering* &#39;s plane of Eldraine. This will be its very first playtest. In this playtest, we&#39;ll build characters and throw them into some action, hopefully testing out the game&#39;s modular playbooks, basic moves, and the Lesson mechanic that can grant Advantage or Disadvantage.

DURATION: 3 and 1/3 hours

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 4 players total.

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: We will use CATS, the X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and the Open Door Policy. This event abides by the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

SET UP INFO: We will play over Streamyard. Expect a set-up email from me about a week before the session, with a link to a Google sheet character keeper.

BREAKS: two ten-minute breaks (and more as requested)

RECORDED: Provided all players give permission, sessions will be recorded for my reference, and possibly posted to the Cloven Pine Games Youtube channel.

PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: No, rules will be taught in play.

Starring: Brandon B, Marc M, <a class="mention" href="/u/groupsoliloquy">@GroupSoliloquy</a>, David L<br>
In the very first playtest of a new game, we follow a quartet of squires venturing into a dark fairy tale wood to prove themselves worthy of knighthood. Bronwen strikes down a wolf that turns out to be a cursed man. Lancer recovers tome full of spells and considers whom it rightly belongs to. Ozadeam glimpses a terrible future and works to prevent it. Caelia taunts an angry mob and a bitter sorceress to buy time and space for her allies.<br>
