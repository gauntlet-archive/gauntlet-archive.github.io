    <description>Mentioned elsethread: the sorts of games we play change our thinking.

At its most obvious, this is obvious: Doing the same thing repetitively modifies how we think about the world.

In what ways -- positive, negative, indifferent -- do you see your thinking affected by gaming?

Here are a few obvious ones for me:
1. 3x3 grid alignment. Despite _reading lots of books on ethics_, I use the 3x3 D&amp;D alignment grid as a shorthand and how I generally think about morality.

2. Hit points. Oh god. I think of people as having hit points. This is being modified by PBTA in general and Blades in particular, but still.

3. Spell slots. I think of the harder things I do as spell slots, and wonder if I have enough spell slots to do hard work in a given day.

I&#39;m positive there are lots of others, both that I have and that others do. How have RPGs / board games / etc impacted your thinking about the world?</description>

<p>Totally this! RPG terms have become common lexicon in our house. Conversations with my husband will often look like:</p>
<p>“That new coworker? I’m learning that he’s got a really high intelligence score, but really low wisdom.”<br>
or<br>
“If she were a Monsterheart’s character, she’d be the Queen, hundred percent.”<br>
or<br>
“So…bad news: I burnt dinner. Good news: I get XP!”</p>
<p>It’s a nice way to shorthand a lot of things, and to gamify life when it might otherwise be tedious or disappointing.</p>

<p>I also think in terms of skill checks/saving throws. Examples: If I fumble something, I “failed my Dex check;”  if I sneak up behind someone, I “made my Stealth check;” or if I can’t resist taking a third donut, I “failed my Will save.”</p>

              <p>oh yeah. I think of a lot of shows as RPGs, and wonder which system they fit. The Expanse is clearly from Traveller, but it’s more AW with it’s partial successes, plot advances on misses, etc.</p>
<p>And of course: Shows are actually scripted and there’s no chance involved. But, RPGs have made me think of the world as a place with chance, partial successes, source of drama, etc. Even though I know that, more or less, the world isn’t actually a narrative.</p>
