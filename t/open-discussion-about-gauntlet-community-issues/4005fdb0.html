          <p>As a follow up, here is a more detailed post on why I stopped supporting the Gauntlet.</p>
<p>I ultimately left and stopped supporting the Gauntlet because I was angry, frustrated, and exhausted. I was proud to be a member of The Gauntlet. I felt like I contributed a lot to make it a better place. Seeing many people, many marginalized people, speak up about concerns only to be dismissed and gaslit for months was frustrating and anger inducing. I was exhausted from putting energy in trying to make the changes I wanted to see‚Ä¶ and seeing few, if any, results.</p>
<p>There were many hurtful actions</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking good faith criticisms on Twitter as bad faith engagements</li>
<li>Using Slack admin power to remove someone from Slack over a personal disagreement</li>
<li>Using the blog to attack another person</li>
<li>Lying to the community about what happened with hurtful actions</li>
<li>Lying to the community about who was running the Gauntlet Twitter account</li>
<li>Promises of leaving a space, then coming back, sometimes as a different persona</li>
<li>Us vs. Them attitude, we‚Äôre the best everyone else isn‚Äôt as good as us</li>
<li>‚ÄúSubtweeting‚Äù both on Twitter and in the Gauntlet Slack, especially in a channel expressly designed for being safe where you could be vulnerable</li>
<li>Dismissing, gaslighting, and silencing folx, often marginalized folx, when they brought up concerns</li>
<li>Fostering an environment of silence, where it did not feel safe to bring up legitimate concerns</li>
<li>Swearing and abuse in direct messages</li>
<li>Not financially compensating or under compensating those who contribute, especially to projects being sold</li>
</ul>
<p>Above, I intentionally focused on the actions and not the people, because it was not just one person. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list. These are things I observed or was made aware of by people I trust, there very well could be more, this is just my perspective.</p>

<p>Jason is owner of The Gauntlet as a company. He is in charge of the financial (Patreon) and publishing side (Kickstarters, Codex). He handles payment for things like the developer services, server for the calendar, and other upkeep. Jason‚Äôs ownership is not going to change.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For me this was the final straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I don‚Äôt want to make the sole proprietor LLC or the brand more valuable. I don‚Äôt want to contribute my time, labor, or money to it. That might seem like a small and petty thing to leave over, especially considering all the other hurtful actions, but like I said it was the final straw, everything else also weighed heavily on me.</p>
<p>I have the privilege to have multiple gaming events still in my life. And if I wanted to, I am positive I can arrange more gaming events outside the structure of the Gauntlet. I have multiple places I can talk about games and game related discussions outside the Gauntlet. Those were the two primary enticements to me, with my privilege to be able to do those elsewhere, I don‚Äôt need to support the Gauntlet.</p>
<p>I totally understand that for some people the Gauntlet is still a good place for them to be able to play games and have discussions around games. I hold no ill will towards any who need or want to stay for these reasons. I would still love to talk with you and play games with you. I totally welcome you to find me and reach out to me outside of the Gauntlet structure.</p>

          <p>Thanks Yoshi!  This makes a lot more sense after your explanation.  As an only forum level contributor I finally have an idea of what kind of situation we have here.  It is much appreciated.</p>
<p>For those of us on the outside,  it felt bizarre. Shane was one my primary contacts on here (more of my likes than anyone else). Then, Nov.9, bam, this cool little forum I found a few months ago was frozen for day after a brief announcement from Shane.</p>
<p>Then, the next day it was back‚Ä¶ with no info about it except that a bunch of admins quit en masse unexpectedly and without warning shutdown the forum (although it is now shown to be attrition for weeks). Then, an online row broke out on this thread‚Ä¶of which, I for one, could not figure out how that fight was related to the sudden shutdown in Nov.</p>
<p>Thanks for clearing this up‚Ä¶for me at least.</p>

Until the mods update the title on the thread here, I can totally understand the confusion. This thread now, has turned into a Q&amp;A and information dump of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the moderators stopped being mods</li>
<li>Why many folks have and are leaving the Gauntlet</li>
<li>Some additional details on what events have taken place</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a additional thoughts on what the thread should be renamed, I‚Äôm sure the remaining moderators would love to hear those suggestions (but maybe not as part of this thread)</p>

<p>There were some internal discussions on the Basecamp for selecting additional members, but it had stalled out with other tasks taking more focus. When I left some names had been suggested, but no one had been approached yet. As of right now the only members were those from the earlier formation when Lowell took over as Community Manager.</p>

          <p>Cross posting from the Slack because Slack deleting messages is part of the problem.</p>
<p>I was on this bandwagon because I believed in it and now I can‚Äôt anymore. I am amongst the marginalized folx whose harm is ACTUALLY being erased here. Read: those in power aren‚Äôt being erased, that‚Äôs propaganda and further adds to real erasure. I legit never got a fucking ounce of recognition or restitution when Jason continually escalated a social media war with Ross Cowman in some fucked up ways over my game Wolf Run AND IGNORED MY WISH NOT TO. This was well over a year ago, and as you new folx may have picked up, it‚Äôs only gotten worse. Now you know. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/sparklesc164.png?v=9" title=":sparkles:" class="emoji" alt=":sparkles:"></p>
<p>I‚Äôm sorry this community‚Äôs promise was shattered. Despite all the negativity, there‚Äôs a lot to be learned here, and I‚Äôm taking it forward.</p>
<p>Find &amp; make spaces (pluaral) you can believe in and have a voice in. Don‚Äôt be a pillar for a hierarchy that can‚Äôt hold a bad actor accountable just because he insists upon you that HE owns the community &amp; production YOU worked to help succeed. Fuck capitalism, love y‚Äôall, you‚Äôre amazing and deserve the best <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/sparkling_heartc164.png?v=9" title=":sparkling_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":sparkling_heart:">  I know some of you won‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm saying here, and I may be burning bridges, but this is a long time coming and I stand completely with the others who have left.</p>
