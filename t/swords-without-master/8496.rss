    <title>Swords Without Master</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/swords-without-master/8496</link>
    <description>*“Gather writing implements, scraps of paper, three or four of your cohorts, and two six-sided dice that you can easily tell apart to a table. A mahogany table adorned with thick, greasy candles and five human skulls. Failing that, a stout oaken table near a glowing hearth, replete with ale-filled steins and a succulent roast. Or, if you prefer, a tabletop chipped whole from a single obsidian stone, placed on the back of a coiled serpent of silver in a room high in a lonely tower shrouded in a prismatic fog.”*

A game of strange sorceries, brutal violence and astounding wonder by Epidiah Ravachol. Become rogues in a world of swords and sorcery, living by your wits and prowess, plunging into the unknown, and seizing from it untold treasures.

**System:**  Swords Without Master (No experience with the system is necessary, rules will be taught.)

**Time:**  Saturday, December 17th at 8:00 PM EST

**Number of players:**  3 - with one extra spot reserved for José 

**Duration:**  3 hrs

**Break:**  10 minute break about halfway through

**Recording Session:**  With consent from all players

**Posting Recording:**  With consent from all players

**Concept**

Classic sword and sorcery in the vein of Conan, Fafhard &amp; Grey Mouser, Dying Earth, etc. 

**Aim**
Create moments of wonder and pen a tale of larger than life heroes. 

**Tone**
Over the top adventure. 

**Subject Matter**
There will likely be themes of violence and death

**Technology:**
Zoom - for video communications
Roll For Your Party - for dice
Pinterest - we have a pinterest board to facilitate finding images so a pinterest account is recommended but not required

**Safety tools** : Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html), Lines &amp; Veils , X-card, Open Door policy

I will send further information in an email one week before the game.
