    <description>I found this while going through some old game storage boxes of mine. Pretty sure I got this at a con in Lexington, KY in 90 or 91. If anyone&#39;s interested I can do some scans. Just for nostalgia/fun.

<p>The good thing about <a href="http://archive.org" rel="nofollow noopener">archive.org</a> is that it aims to be a digital library and their main reason for existing is preserving of all kinds of stuff, both digital and digitized real world items. They generally have a pretty good track record of defending their right to preserving the items on their servers.</p>
<p>I am not a  lawyer, but uploading something <a href="http://archive.org" rel="nofollow noopener">archive.org</a> is similar to donating to your local library. I say that coming to it mostly from retro computing angle, but I have also seen scans of magazines for example preserved there. I think you should be in the clear when it comes to copyright concerns in that case.</p>

              <p>I would also love to see the scans. There is a part of me that aches knowing stuff like this will be lost to the mists of time. I remember reading an old issue of Dragon magazine once and was shocked by how much modern thinking in game design actually originated in these old sources.</p>
<p>Someone should really start some kind of ttrpg ephemera preservation project. Hell, I’d spend some budget on that if someone wanted to spearhead it.</p>
