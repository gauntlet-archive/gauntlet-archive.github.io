<p>And PbtA games tend to have quite a large space to maneuver in without triggering any rules.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think this is misunderstanding what‚Äôs typically going on in archetypal OSR play.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre not ‚Äúavoiding triggering the rules‚Äù; that a player is allowed to attempt something using fictional positioning is very much part of the rules that people play the game by (arguably the most important rule, for a lot of people).</p>
<p>The ‚Äúcleverness‚Äù is in <strong>being able to suggest that the situation in question can be resolved through the use of a bespoke move outlined by the player</strong> (typically to their own advantage; otherwise it‚Äôs not really all that clever). Perhaps in the most lopsided of situations this results in the situation being resolved by clear declaration of fiat, but in many cases it‚Äôs far less clear-cut.</p>
<p>In OSR play, <strong>everything</strong> that exists in the fiction can potentially have teeth, because everything that exists in the fiction might potentially be a challenge or a way to overcome a challenge; player cleverness is in figuring out how to hook into those teeth. This is, I think, rather the opposite of ‚Äúfictional positioning without triggering a move‚Äù that happens in PbtA play.</p>

          <p>Yes, I think that‚Äôs a very good distillation. I agree with yukamichi.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I got my hands on Vagabonds of Dyfed and read through it. It‚Äôs a nice ruleset! Seems quite well put together, and would work work challenge-oriented play.</p>
<p>It avoids many/most (maybe even all?) of the pitfalls posed by typical PbtA designs which might get in the way of ‚Äúchallengeful‚Äù play. (I think freeform tags are a problematic match for this kind of gaming, for example, but I‚Äôm sure some people can make that work.)</p>
<p>However, I think it‚Äôs not a coinidence that‚Ä¶ it has almost no PbtA-based design features whatsoever. Aside from rolling 2d6+adds and a similar scale of success, does it actually have anything in common with PbtA games? There is no move structure (either player-side moves or MC moves), no playbooks, no picklists, no subsystems that tie into that, no attempt to structure the ‚Äúconversation‚Äù - which, according to Vincent Baker, is one of the foundational things that makes PbtA PbtA, it has an initiative system, etc, etc. I don‚Äôt see much that‚Äôs definitionally PbtA here except for the dice mechanic.</p>
<p>Perhaps the list of techniques could be seen as a sort of PbtA-ism? Maybe, if you squint.</p>
<p>Perhaps that‚Äôs actually a good proof of concept? <em>Vagabonds</em> had to step <em>this far</em> away from typical PbtA design in order to fulfil its desired agenda.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôm sorry; but this feels like a niggling distinction to me ‚Äì you‚Äôre basically playing the ‚Äúunwritten rules vs written rules‚Äù card where I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate.  All these rules are rules, and I don‚Äôt think anything I have said breaks down when it is applied unwritten rules.</p>
<p>‚Äúthat a player is allowed to attempt something using fictional positioning is very much part of the rules that people play the game by‚Äù is absolutely a part of PbtA principles. Maybe even <em>the</em> principle. ‚ÄúThe game is a conversation and moves only occur when they specifically say so.‚Äù</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not even sure which set of games you are talking about with ‚Äúproposing bespoke moves‚Äù because it sounds like you are still talking about OSR games, but you are using PbtA terminology.</p>
<p>Lastly, ‚ÄúIn OSR play, <strong>everything</strong> that exists in the fiction can potentially have teeth, because everything that exists in the fiction might potentially be a challenge or a way to overcome a challenge‚Äù ‚Äì is precisely true in PbtA play as well.</p>
<p>So no; I don‚Äôt get it. It sounds like you are using different words to say exactly the same thing.  I‚Äôm going to duck out of this conversation at this point, because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ‚ÄòGetting it‚Äô and I‚Äôm just making a bunch of noise to people who clearly think they do.</p>
