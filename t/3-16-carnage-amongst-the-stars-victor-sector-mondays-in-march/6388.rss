    <description>***For the first 48 hours (*until 16th January at 1pm*) please only sign up to this game if you have already played in a previous game of 3:16 with me on The Gauntlet.***

*“Tired Of Life? Join The Expeditionary Force And See The Cosmos.”*
— **Recruitment Advert**

![Vrakk-300x218|300x218](upload://xbnxgKRSq4X1KcNzjxKjf85Twk8.jpeg) 

The elite 3:16th Expeditionary Force left Terra many years ago with an explicit mission: Alien civilizations, intelligences and life of any kind are to be wiped out to protect the future safety of the people home on Terra.

This is the 3:16th&#39;s final sector, and things are going to get bloody!

This session is scheduled for 3.5 hours, and will be recorded (though I&#39;ll check with everyone at the end of the session to make sure it&#39;s ok to make public).

This is for 4 sessions of 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars. Being able to attend each session is encouraged but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. This is a continuation of previous sectors played and if you played in those you are welcome to return to duty with your Trooper. But if you didn&#39;t, fresh meat is always welcome on the front lines!

**Content Warning:** Militarism, Genocide

We will be using Zoom as the platform. Participants must be able to access Roll20 tools for the game.
The X-card will be used. The community&#39;s Code of Conduct will be in operation.

RSVPs open to all on 17th January at 1pm
