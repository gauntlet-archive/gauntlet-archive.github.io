They say it can cure any ailment or injury: *mellified man*, a human body steeped for a century in the sacred honey of the Bleeding Kaleidoscope. If you could bring back even a small piece of this unthinkable delicacy you could be set for life, or longer…

Trophy Dark is a collaborative storytelling game about doomed treasure hunters and the forest that will destroy them, by Jess Ross. No rules knowledge is expected or required, and rules will be taught during play. The Paperflesh Advent is an incursion by Speak The Sky and includes both psychological and body horror elements. Jason Cordova and Judd Karlman discussed this incursion on the first episode of the Trophy podcast, The Sixth Ring, praising its creepiness and grotesquerie, and the quality of its writing and structure.

The game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct and use safety tools including lines and veils, the X Card, and the open door policy. 

This will be a four-hour one-shot with ten minute breaks on the hour via StreamYard, with optional recording if all players consent.
