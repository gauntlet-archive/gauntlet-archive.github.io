    <title>Trophy Dark risk roll question</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/trophy-dark-risk-roll-question/7891</link>
    <description>Hi!! I just discovered this great game and I was thinking to master a session with my friends . Checking the rules I found something that I don&#39;t fully understand, is about the risk roll . In a risk roll , the only way to get damage is to have your black dice the higher (or equal to the white higher) and more than your ruin, in this case you will increase your ruin by one . But what if you fail, in a potential dangerous situation, but your black dice doesn&#39;t match this , so is not the higher and is not over your ruin? 
Example you have 1 ruin . You want to dodge a attack by an angry village , you roll 2 dices (you have any skill , and the black dice because you are in danger) , the results are 2 on white and 1 on black , is a fail . So do you don&#39;t have any damage for that? Even if is a fail in a danger situation???
I hope this makes sense üòÖ
Thanks</description>

              <p>Thanks for the reply , all makes sense now , I think my problem was to think that the ruin was directly related with  a physical damage , and is not , you can have damage but not a ruin increase . They can be different things . Even usually ruin means physical damaged is more related to the forest corruption .<br>
Thanks a lot ! Now I understand way better the game .</p>

<p>As <a class="mention" href="/u/dereel">@DeReel</a> says, the roll usually covers more than a single action, and can cover an entire obstacle if you want to it.  The other key thing to remember is that Ruin isn‚Äôt damage.  It is your countdown to being out of the game, but it doesn‚Äôt represent how badly hurt you are, it represents to what extent you have been coopted by the Forest, and turned towards its ends.  Ruin isn‚Äôt a consequence of failure, as you note, it only happens under certain conditions.   From your later response, you seem concerned about the language ‚Äúrisk your body or your mind‚Äù when using a dark die.  But a failure on that roll is no different than a failure without a dark die, if the dark die isn‚Äôt higher.  Think of it this way. You risked your body or your mind (mechanically, you risked the dark die being higher than the light die), and that risk worked out in your favor.  Even if you didn‚Äôt succeed at what you were doing, the additonal wager doesn‚Äôt cost you anything.  So it‚Äôs just like any other Risk roll.  When you fail a Risk roll, the situation gets worse, that is, narrative consequences take place.  That can mean bodily injury, it can mean somebody or something you care about is hurt or lost, it can mean the enemy gets stronger, it means you can get lost or separated from the party‚Ä¶ really anything that makes sense narratively.</p>

              <p>Hi!! Thanks for the reply ! Yes my playing experience is more task-orient , like CoC , so this kind of mechanics are a bit confusing to me . I totally understand your point , and I was thinking something similar, so it‚Äôs not a dodge but a leaving battle goal. that would be in a normal risk roll, but in Trophy Dark you can add a black dice if you want to put in risk your body or your mind , so basically you get another dice but the situation becomes physically or psychologically dangerous. And if this dice is the higher and higher than your ruin , you will get 1 ruin penalty ( the ruin can be interpreted as damage of different types and the closer you are to surrender to the forest‚Ä¶more or less). But what happen when you fail a risk roll with the ‚Äúrisk your body or your mind‚Äù dice, but the black dice is not the bigger?  I think here there are 2 ways , one is the situation just become dangerous ( physically or mentally) when the black dice is bigger ( increasing the number of black dices increase the probability of this to happen ) if not is just a non dangerous situation or two, receiving a physical damage doesn‚Äôt need to be reflected in your ruin, it can be a wound ( for example)  that will make your life more complicated in the adventure.<br>
Or maybe is just both and depending on the situation <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:">.</p>

              <p>I don‚Äôt know the game well, and I don‚Äôt know your past playing experience, but I‚Äôll try guessing.</p>
<p>If Trophy Dark uses conflict-based rolls as I believe it does, combat/action scene are abstracted like this : the player states a goal for the conflict/scene. If the goal is for the character to evade unharmed, then it‚Äôs not a mere dodge (tasked-based roll). Success means leaving the battlefield, and the end of the conflict/scene. This player, rolling as you said 2W-1B, would not have their character hurt, but stuck in the scene.</p>
<p>This is me supposing that you come from a playstyle where rolls tend to be more task-oriented (note the careful wording), which could be totally wrong - please excuse me for that wild guess, and doubly so if I‚Äôm wrong.</p>
