              <p>Hm, not really, unfortunately. You are a very generic character; it’s not like Pandemic, where you have individual strengths, roles, and a little portrait. You’re just a meeple and no more. Sometimes you “get” to be shift manager, which is extra stressful, because you have the last word on which task other people place their meeple and also take all the blame (“stress” tokens) if you fail that round. Otherwise everybody is the same.</p>

              <p>That sounds interesting. Is it possible to roleplay the board game, i.e. playing a role even if it means board game mechanics inefficiencies?</p>

              <p>I have played <strong>Holding On</strong> (I was a play tester, in fact) and it is emotionally very fascinating. It has been controversial for its not-happy subject matter among some board gamers - you play a group of nurses and doctors trying to find out the backstory of a dying old man who is not very coherent most of the time.</p>
<p>What has rubbed some people the wrong way, but is also one of the most important part to me is that there’s the constant dilemma of whether to focus on physical care and pain and learning more information (which will help you contact any next of kin and bring the patient some peace of mind).</p>
<p>As a board game, it is not exceedingly innovative for its mechanics, though it has something like a light legacy-style campaign mode with more stuff and goals being revealed over time.</p>
