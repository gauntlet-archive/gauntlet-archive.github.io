    <title>Hard science fiction games</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/hard-science-fiction-games/3821</link>
    <description>I&#39;m interested in finding some [hard science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_science_fiction) games set in space. That is, games where the science is reasonably accurate: no magic, no FTL, etc. In terms of fictional touchpoints, think &quot;Gravity&quot; and &quot;The Martian&quot; or, at the very outside, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. I&#39;m not super concerned at the moment with the &#39;mechanical genre&#39;, as it were, whether it&#39;s PbtA or traditional or something else entirely.

While I&#39;ve played (and enjoyed) other science fiction games, this is a really specific itch that things like Traveller and Scum &amp; Villainy don&#39;t quite scratch. Thoughts / suggestions / pointers welcome.</description>

              <p>I’ve been told that the 2300 setting for Traveller is pretty hard sci-fi, and takes place before the advent of jump drives. Also, it probably wouldn’t be hard to reskin Scum and Villiany to the task. Just change the setting and remove/replace the jump drives with another ship module, and declare that Xenos either don’t exist or aren’t available for use as player characters.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.tckroleplaying.com/marscolony/" rel="nofollow noopener">Mars Colony</a> is a great two-player game. If you both know a few things about plausible Mars colonization, it will naturally make for a hard sci-fi story.</p>
<p>But the real reason I’m replying to this topic is to further boost the signal for High Frontier. The game is easily the best hard sci-fi story-telling engine I’ve encountered. It doesn’t tell stories at the individual scale, but at the crew/company/nation-state level. While that might sound a little difficult to engage with, I guarantee that if you like stories set in the solar system in the next couple hundred years, High Frontier will generate experiences that totally captivate you. Until an RPG-version of it exists, it is the closest I’ve come to a truly great hard sci-fi story game.</p>

              <p>What, in your mind, would qualify a game as a “good hard science fiction” game? Do you need rules that simulate real physics with detailed descriptions of how the science works?</p>
<p>Or do you just want a storytelling system that could generate the kind of “plot beats” in the source material you’re citing (Gravity, The Martian)?</p>
<p>I think many systems are actually capable of the latter as long as the players understand enough of the science.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/yoshi">@yoshi</a> gets to the point. Being hard sci-fi isn’t much of a premise for a game. People go to science fantasy and pulp sci-fi because they want games that include travel to different planets and zipping about on spaceships. The Expanse is a ship based adventure story, so the main way it breaks the hard SF mandate is in a silly powerful drive system.</p>
<p>So what is the actual premise of the game? What do the PCs do?</p>

              <p>Based on a few articles I’ve seen the system was apparently d20 Modern with homebrewed space combat. Personally I find it interesting that people often recommend the Expanse as hard sci-fi because while many aspects are (notably space travel / flight mechanics) there are many bits that aren’t (which I won’t mention due to spoilers). I skipped the RPG kickstarter so I’ve no idea how well it does in emulating a hard sci-fi feel.</p>

              <p>I reckon Flotsam would, if you choose the right set of options. The “spirits” would need to be AIs or aliens rather than gods or ghosts, for example. But the game does provide those options, you don’t have to do any reskinning.</p>
<p>I think my question would be, what are you looking for the game to do for you in the way of supporting hard SF? If you’re looking for rules for interstellar travel and hard vacuum, that’s a totally different game from one which allows you to create interesting social situations of the sort you find in hard SF, but leaves all the tech and physics simulation up to you.</p>

              <p>What kind of story would you like to tell? To me, if the main detail is that it is hard sci-fi in space that implies you will want stories that deal with the difficulties of space travel/living. To me, this then implies you might want a system or module that really supports having the rigors and difficulties of space come into play.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> maybe you just want that as a backdrop, in which case you might be able to do a bunch of different things (that don’t have magic) just with a space sci-fi backdrop.</p>
<p>For me, my first recommendation is Dialect with either the “The Outpost” or the “2081, Solar Slums” backdrops. Though “Sing the Earth Electric” might also work.</p>
<p>I haven’t played it yet, but “Flotsom: Adrift amongst the Stars” by <a class="mention" href="/u/rabalias">@rabalias</a> might work as well.</p>

              <p><strong>Mothership</strong> is popular right now. The characters are all working-class spacefarers in a primarily human universe. It’s a horror game that focuses on the human scale, so it’s probably a bit more <strong>Alien</strong> or <strong>Moon</strong> than <strong>Maritan</strong> or <strong>Gravity</strong>, but the intimate, almost claustrophobic focus on individuals fits with what you’re asking for, and any tech you deem off-limits can be safely excluded for the same reason. The larger universe is very much in the background.</p>

<p>I would also recommend the boardgame High Frontier if you can find a copy of it. It’s detailed enough to work as a ship movement system for a roleplaying game by a large margin. Like “you need to calculate how much reaction mass you need for this particular type of engine moving along this path from this Lagrange point to that specific asteroid, oh and don’t forget you’ll want to be able to land, and also the trip will take four years there and maybe you won’t be able to come back home again” detailed. It also includes a bunch of more or less reasonable technologies that can make for a fun setting.</p>
