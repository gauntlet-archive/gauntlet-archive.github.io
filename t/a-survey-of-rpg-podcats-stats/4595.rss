    <description>[Admin - not sure if this is the right place for this discussion, if not tell me and I&#39;ll repost where appropriate]

Hello friends, 
I&#39;m trying to understand how well (or not well) my RPG podcast is doing but I have no other RPG podcast stats for comparison, so I&#39;ve created this survey for RPG podcats. 
It&#39;ll help a lot if you could pass this link to any RPG podcast and I&#39;ll be happy to share the results &amp; insights of the survey with anyone who will be interested. 

The survey: https://forms.gle/FCLc3cGwBeSGWcvg6</description>
