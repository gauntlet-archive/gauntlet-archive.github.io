    <title>Ask the Oracle - Official Podcast for the Ironsworn RPG</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/ask-the-oracle-official-podcast-for-the-ironsworn-rpg/3859</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started putting out a weekly podcast dedicated to my free small press RPG. The first two episodes, available now, are dedicated to world creation and character creation for the two-player, GM-less campaign which we&#39;ll undertake in future episodes.

Available at https://ironsworn.podbean.com/, and (hopefully) on your preferred podcast app.

Mad respect to all of the Gauntlet podcasters. Holy cow, is it a bunch of work.</description>
