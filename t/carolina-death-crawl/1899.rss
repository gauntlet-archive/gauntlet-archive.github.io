    <description>CAROLINA DEATH CRAWL is a swampy, Southern Gothic roleplaying card game for three or more players. At the height of the American Civil War, your characters have been abandoned deep behind Confederate lines. Can they fight their way through enemy territory and treacherous terrain back to safety? For all but one, the answer is “no!”, but the dark story you tell in trying will be memorable and thrilling.

This is a game about trying not to die in a swamp, but you probably will. You&#39;ll probably be murdered by another player character. The game asks your character to do bad things, so please be prepared for that. But! [The X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will always be on the table, and [the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in effect. We’ll also use [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and lines and veils.

This event is scheduled to run for 4 hours. With the consent of all participants, it will be recorded.
