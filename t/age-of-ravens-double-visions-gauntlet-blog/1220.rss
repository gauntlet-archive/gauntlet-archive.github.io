    <description>Today on the blog I follow up my &quot;Lazy Hacks&quot; post from last week. This time I walk through two quick reskins that I&#39;ve been working on: one well on its way and the other superseded by recent events. I also mention fast hacks suggested by @darren and @Auzumel_S. It&#39;s a fun piece which also gives me an excuse to link to a couple of ongoing Kickstarters.

**[Age of Ravens: Double Visions](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-double-visions)** 

If you have ideas for fast reskins, I&#39;d love to hear about them here or in the blogs comments. Or if you have feedback/suggestions for either of my hack concepts. Hack, hack, hack. I keep saying it because that phrase drives a player in our f2f group into a rage.</description>

              <p>Yeah, I’m trying not to drive off a side road thinking about that. There’s a “Close Quarters” move from IIRC <em>Uncharted Worlds</em> that helps set up those one-on-one convo bits from travelling stories. Combine that with some moves or charts for generating what happens when you arrive at a new settlement (like old histories popping up, the problems its facing), and some stuff for fighting your way up the food chain of villainy towards the Big Bad (with each victory having an emotional/social cost).</p>

              <p>Mystic Veil/Veiled Streets is blowing my mind. When <a class="mention" href="/u/darren">@darren</a> suggested using  Veil 2020 to explore that fantasy city, my mind was <em>blown</em>. I love the fantasy <em>aesthetic</em> but I can relate more with the <em>themes</em> of cyberpunk.</p>
<p>I bet that one easy way to approach a fast-hack is by mashing up an aesthetic and a theme. I always recommend the <a href="https://www.stophackandroll.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Stop Hack and Roll podcast</a> to folks interested in hacking RPGs. One game they developed was Luchadoratón, which mashes up the themes of lucha libre with the aesthetic of tiny mice. This might also be a fix for <a class="mention" href="/u/auzumel_s">@Auzumel_S</a>’s issue with steampunk: all aesthetic, no theme. Steampunk needs a partner to become interesting.</p>
