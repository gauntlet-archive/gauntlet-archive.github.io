          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/11/08/crowdfunding-collection-155/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #155, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/01 and 11/08</b></a>.</p>
<p>Despite I all challenges, I am back with a small, but excellent collection of ttrpg crowdfundings project started last week. Let’s delve into it.</p>
<p>I would like to start by presenting you <b>Summon Skate</b>. The project is about funding the translation of an existing Japanese ttrpg. The game itself has the players fighting strange, nightmarish monsters by summoning counter measures and fighting them… via figure skating. Which happens in a somewhat different temporary dimension, akin to X/1999. The game offers various difficulty settings and various game modes from conventions to campaigns. It’s really cool, and deserves more support. I am in and you should take a look. Maybe you like skeletons and want to have a fun game for one shots? <b>Bones and Basements</b> has you covered. You’ll be trying to please the Lich lord. It provides a rulelite system and fun approach to do so, thus take a look. Then there’s <b>Nuclear Winter wonderland!</b> For a glowing christmas season. Well, you’ll be playing Santas elves, who have to provide him with stuff to build toys for kids. Only problem, you are playing in a post-nuclear war world. It’s cute, zine sized and rules lite. Neat! Maybe you want to <b>Boldy Go!</b> where no one has gone before and explore space. Well, Boldly Go has you covered. While taking cues from Star Trek (TOS &amp; TNG), the game only spans 80 pages, yet still enables you to craft your ship, crew and captain next to your characters. Take a look!<br>
Of course there are more projects. <b>Vice &amp; Virtue</b> a system-neutral mechanic to spice up your game with moral challenges and options to open up the direction of your games to players input. I am quite tempted. Fans of D&amp;D 5E get a multitude of sourcebooks, adventures and with <b>The Eastmere Lands</b> a fresh setting. There are beer inspired dice with the <b>Brew Dice</b>, that actually look good, as do the <b>SD Dice, Sharp Edge Dice Collection</b>. Though am not sure about putting sharp edge dice into soap. You’ll find that Alis Games finances the Polish translation of <b>Kult</b>. Well and the two French projects – <b>Hong Kong – Les Chroniques de l’Étrange</b> and <b>27C</b> – do look cool tool.<br>
You’ll find these and many more cool projects overe here:</p>
<p><b>English Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>4 Roleplaying Games<br>
1 Setting<br>
5 Sourcebooks<br>
3 D&amp;D 5E Adventures<br>
4 Dice Projects<br>
4 Accessoires<br>
1 Online Platform<br>
1 Enamel Pin<br>
2 Various RPG Projects<br>
1 Other Game</p>
<p><b>French Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>2 Roleplaying Games</p>
<p><b>Polish Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>1 Roleplaying Game</p>
