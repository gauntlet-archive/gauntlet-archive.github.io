    <title>Looking For Feedback: Get Ready 2 Rock</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-for-feedback-get-ready-2-rock/1959</link>
    <description>After a useful playtest on the Gauntlet (as well as Metatopia and Breakout), I&#39;ve produced another iteration of Get Ready 2 Rock, my GMless PbtA game about stupid rock star drama (inspired by things like This Is Spinal Tap, Flight of the Conchords, and VH1 Behind the Music). I&#39;m hoping this version is more streamlined and gets closer to being able to click with how I envision it being able to play.

Play materials (note: any moves highlighted in yellow still need to be rewritten from the previous iteration): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Va6owW9xuu8XGqsWnPk4teRe_LFLgvwk12gYAXnic0/edit?usp=sharing</description>
