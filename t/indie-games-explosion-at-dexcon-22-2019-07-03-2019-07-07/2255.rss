    <description>(on behalf of @Michael_Miller) 

 &gt; The *Indie Games eXplosion* schedule for DEXCON 22 (July 3–July 7, 2019 in Morristown, NJ) is now available: http://ipressgames.com/igx-update/ We are still looking for GMs to offer games, get a free badge, and have a great time. Deadline for events is *June 10* (this coming Monday).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks. Hope to see you at the con!

This will be my (@shanel) fourth Dexcon and, although it&#39;s not Dreamation, every year it&#39;s been more indie game infused than the year before. A ton of that is because of the work the Millers do with IGX and their Sparks program (games on demand).

If you are local I totally recommend coming out. Plenty of Gauntleteers will be in attendance and running games.</description>
