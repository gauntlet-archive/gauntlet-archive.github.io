    <title>The Pack - Pets in the Post-Apocalypse (play test) - Tuesdays in October</title>

    <description>Sprocket was in the woods out back when the light flashed, brighter than any storm she’d ever seen. The light blinded her momentarily, even through the dense trees. She paused, nose to the air. Something was different, and she could tell immediately by the shifts in the scents on the air. But it was the sounds that confirmed it: One moment she heard her person calling for dinner and the next moment, total silence.

Running at full press toward her home, she couldn’t help but notice wisps of smoke rising from the ground. Not a person in sight, but it was the silence that made Sprocket’s heart race.

She burst through the back door into the kitchen, finding her food spilled all over the floor, a wisp of smoke rising nearby. Only then was the silence broken: dozens of dog voices lifted in a collective howl.

-------------------

The Pack is a Belonging Outside Belonging game about pets in the post-apocalypse. The players play as dogs who come together after discovering their humans are gone.

This is a play test of a game currently in development. To paraphrase Jammi: the game might not work as expected, but I will try to make sure everyone has fun.

The main touchstones for The Pack are comics like [Beasts of Burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beasts_of_Burden) (Evan Dorkin and Jill Thompson), [We3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We3) (Grant Morrison), and [Rover Red Charlie](https://www.comixology.com/Rover-Red-Charlie-1-of-6/digital-comic/55411) (Garth Ennis).

-------------------

**System**: The Pack (Belonging Outside Belonging)
**Duration**: Four 2.5-hour sessions
**Breaks**: 2 five-minute breaks per session
**Venue**: GM’s Zoom
**Recording**: Yes, but made public only with consent from all the players
**Attendance**: Joining all four sessions is ideal but not required
**Safety**: Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, any others suggested by the players

This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)
