    <title>Criteria for prepacked demos</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/criteria-for-prepacked-demos/7917</link>
    <description>Are you familiar with actually good &amp; free TRPG demos which help you to jump into play without proper experience and and get the gist of the game in one-two hours?

I am not looking for *general* starter sets, or little pre-packed games, but more like pre-packed introductory adventure modules with pregen characters and all the necessary rules both for players (and GMs, if there is any) to convey the essence of the gameplay &amp; setting.</description>

              <p>There are a couple for <em>Legacy: Life Among the Ruins</em> which are quite good. They have good pre-gens and campaign starters with enough to play from iirc. Free League’s starter for <em>Mutant Year Zero</em> is also pretty complete and solid. OOH the <em>Coriolis</em> one references things not present in the shortened rules and has some other issues. I’ve run from a couple of the Modiphius starters alone (<em>Star Trek Adventures</em> and <em>Conan</em>). For the Conan one, they have two and one is more interesting than the other (the one with the drums along the river is not very good).</p>
