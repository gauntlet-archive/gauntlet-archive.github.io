              <p>Lowell is correct. We reserve Hype for users who are at trust level 2, in order to prevent people from joining the forum just to spam their products.  Trust levels are earned through interaction with the forum, reading, liking and posting. You can read about trust levels here: <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/">https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/</a></p>
