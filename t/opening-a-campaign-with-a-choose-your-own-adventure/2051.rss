    <title>Opening a Campaign With a Choose Your Own Adventure</title>

    <description>About a year ago, I ran a campaign of Apocalypse World: Fallen Empires for my home group.  I had a couple specific setting details that I wanted to include from the start, and a specific tone I wanted to shoot for.  We had done collaborative setting creation for previous campaigns (with Microscope or The Quiet Year) and for my first campaign, I had created a setting Codex that (understandably) no one wanted to read.  I wanted a way to convey the broad strokes of the setting before our session zero conversation, without having any assigned reading: so I made a game!

I&#39;m thinking about doing the same thing for my next campaign, since it was fun to do and my players really liked it.  Has anyone else tried something like this?  Any pitfalls or pro tips to be aware of?</description>

              <p>WOW, that is cool. There was one odd jump, where I thought I’d be advancing on the Franks, but then… nothing?</p>
<p>I don’t know that I’d ever have the time to make such a thing, but it is a great idea.</p>
