          <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/davidmk">@DavidMK</a>, I playtest anywhere and with anyone I can find, but here are a few tips/tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look for Discord servers that have active playtesting channels. For example, Magpie has a monthly community designers spotlight to test new games from designers that are part of their community. There are a couple of servers that are specific for designers as well, like RPG Talk and TTRPG Game Development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run sessions of games that are similar to yours. Even if your game is ‚Äúunique,‚Äù it will have some DNA from other games. For example, my game mixes PbtA, FitD, Cypher System, and old-school D&amp;D. Unique? Sure. But I have run games in those other systems with a few hacks here and there (hacks that look/feel like the game I created), and after those sessions, I ask players if they would like to try a new game that has similar hacks to the ones I incorporated in that session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playtest with your usual group. That obviously requires a ‚Äúusual‚Äù group ‚Äúwilling‚Äù to do it. The way I did it was like this: I first introduced the systems that would lead up to the game I have written. So I run a long campaign of Cypher System, a few one-shots of DW, and a couple of games of BitD for them. Then, I introduced my game, just a one-shot during an off week from our usual game. They enjoyed it so we started a long campaign. But I had to prepare them (similar to what I have to do in education when teaching a new concept: scaffolding the ‚Äúlessons‚Äù).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run your game at cons. Sometimes, it works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully that helps!</p>

<p>That‚Äôs a useful tip. Thanks for sharing. I find discord a little painfully ‚Äúsilo‚Äôed.‚Äù i.e. almost impossible to find anything from a web-search among other challenges.</p>
