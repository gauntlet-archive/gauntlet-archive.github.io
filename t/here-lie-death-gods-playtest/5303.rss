This one shot game is scheduled for 4 hours. I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance. Sessions will be recorded through Zoom for playtest reference only.

***Here Lie Death Gods*  is a story game that is inspired by the slice of life and mundane magick anime &amp; manga like  *Omakae Desu*  and literally any other Shinigami(death gods) format out there. But you do not need to be familiar with either to enjoy this game! This is a loosely Belonging Outside Belonging Game which focuses on a death gods and their day to day life as fetchers of souls. Playbooks center around: ghost that doesn&#39;t want to be fetched, death god assistants, human astral proejects and our characters&#39; overall relationship w/ regrets or dying. Players choose from a series of prompts to help satisfy a 3 act structure.**

This game is being playtested please be kind to maria HAHHAAAA

**Safety tools** : x-card, script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
