          <p>On The Day Of Your Daughter’s Wedding is a Hearts of Wulin hack about organised crime intrigue and melodrama, inspired by feelings-heavy gangster media like The Sopranos, The Godfather, Goodfellas, etc. Play is focused on the characters’ relationships and power struggles rather than the crimes they carry out.</p>
<p>This will be the game’s first play test. We’ll mostly work through character creation and set up stuff, with a little time to play through some scenes, and at the end I’ll ask for any feedback you have. The usual playtest caveats here: this is a rough draft and there are likely to be some gaps and mechanics that aren’t quite clicking, but I think/hope we’ll still have a good time. Only sign up if you’re comfortable playing around with a work in progress.</p>
<p>Because it’s an early playtest, I think this will work better if the players are at least a little familiar with the game’s touchstones and tropes. You don’t need to have seen Godfather Part Two quite as many times as I have, but if you’ve never seen a gangster movie, this may not be for you.</p>
<p>Subject matter for this game includes violence and references to sex work, substance use, gambling, religion and the police. Crime is also obviously and inextricably bound up with major forms of exploitation and oppression, including race, class and gender, so the game may touch on those subjects. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the x card, and the open door, and play under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>The session will be played over Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. I’d like to record the session for my reference if that’s okay with everyone, but happy to keep the video private if anyone prefers that.</p>
<p>I’ll send an email a week before the session to confirm attendance and share play materials.</p>
<p>Open access time for sign ups will be 6pm Christmas Day (!!) AEDT.</p>
