    <title>Droids! A hack of The Skeletons by Jason Morningstar</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/droids-a-hack-of-the-skeletons-by-jason-morningstar/81</link>
    <description>Hey! Throwing this out there for not only some public feedback, but also testing links within posts. Surely most of the stuff here will be links to Google Docs. 

The concept of this game is: What happens to the droids at the palace after Jabba&#39;s death? 

It is inspired by a discussion held during one of @RichRogers Star Wars Saturday games. It borrows heavily from The Skeletons and at this point, needs some trimming of extra droids and some more ideas around the existing playbooks.

Please! Comment on the text and let me know what you like and, more importantly, what you DON&#39;T like!

Edit:
I have removed the link while I continue to work on this project. I will reshare it if and when it is complete, and I have explicit blessing for it&#39;s public dissemination. Thank you everyone for your feedback!</description>

              <p>As far as a game about robots with feelings? I’m 100% about that.</p>
<p>The star wars theme is certainly heavy here because the idea stemmed from Star Wars Saturday games. I might re-write it at some point to be less offensive to a certain mouse and his lawyers and reach out to Jason Morningstar about publishing it. It’s tricky because there is no explicit license to The Skeletons, so I’d have to gain permission. Honestly not sure if I should even be posting this. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/grimacing.png?v=6" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"></p>
