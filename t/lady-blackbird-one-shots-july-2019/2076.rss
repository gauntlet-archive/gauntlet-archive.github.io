Four stand-alone episodes exploring different milestones in Lady Blackbird and companions&#39; adventure through the Wild Blue.

(please note: no Snargle or Goblins in these one-shots)

[Lady Blackbird: The Hand of Sorrow](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LfMhKANoNQ1vvqLfFiB)  (one-shot)
[date=2019-07-06 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-07-06 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
Lady Blackbird fled from a wedding to Count Carlowe because she is still in love with Uriah Flint, a pirate king at the far-end of the floating worlds. She hired a smuggler to ferry her across the Wild Blue, but halfway toward Haven, they were captured by an Imperial Cruiser, the Hand of Sorrow. Unbeknownst to the Lady in disguise, this Captain Cyrus Vance may be wanted by the Empire for more than just smuggling charges.

How will they escape the Imperial reach that threatens to destroy their future?

[Lady Blackbird: Haven](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LfMiymJ9UF_oMHB0-4g)  (one-shot)
[date=2019-07-13 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-07-13 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
Lady Blackbird fled from an arranged marriage in the Imperial World, but here at Haven, a beacon of the Free World, she is cut off from her nobility privileges, especially access to her wealth.

Ex-Imperial soldier Cyrus Vance offered to take her as far along the journey as possible, but their smuggler ship needs fuel, supplies, and a few repairs from their earlier encounter with an Imperial Cruiser.

How will they fly again, before bounty hunters catch up to them?

[Lady Blackbird: Nightport](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LfMjqUP46JDOVgM-tH4)  (one-shot)
[date=2019-07-20 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-07-20 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
Lady Blackbird fled from the darkness of the Imperial World, only to land in crime-infested Nightport. On this dark side of a tidally locked floating world, she and her companions must obtain the Secret of the True Course, so that they may fly through a dangerous cluster of asteroids and debris to reach the palace of the pirate king.

Will they get out of the wheeling and dealing unscathed?

[Lady Blackbird: The Remnants](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LfMkYeCLollMKO9BB9Y)  (one-shot)
[date=2019-07-27 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-07-27 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
Lady Blackbird fled from an arranged marriage to Count Carlowe in the Imperial World, because she is still in love with the pirate king, Uriah Flint. After days of flying through blockades, running from bounty hunters, and dealing with shady crime lords, she and her hired crew are finally approaching the dangerous debris field known as The Remnants.

But it has been six years since Lady Blackbird last seen her old flame. What fate truly awaits them all once they reach the hidden palace of the pirate king?

Each session is scheduled for 3 hours (post-session debrief is OPTIONAL). It is recorded ONLY IF all participants give me permission.

Each session has no exact continuity with the other (other than some key plot line detail), so if you attend more than one session, you can try a different character (with varying shared history) or even a different version of the same character each time.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
------------ AIM -------------
We play to find out what happens to the characters (within a limited time-span). It&#39;s not a competition where one player wins in the end.
---------- TONE ---------------
Swashbuckling melodrama; serious or semi-serious; romance possible but drama more likely (similar to Firefly/Serenity)
--------- SUBJECT MATTER ---------
Imperialism. Vengeance? Power imbalance? Choosing between the lesser of evils? Slavery? (can be &quot;veiled&quot; upon request)

[Disclaimer] I&#39;m a new GM. Introvert, slow thinker, but I&#39;m generally responsive. Feel free to contact me if you have questions or concerns.

Thank you for your time. :innocent:</description>
