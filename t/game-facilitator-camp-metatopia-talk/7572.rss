    <title>Game Facilitator Camp: Metatopia Talk</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/game-facilitator-camp-metatopia-talk/7572</link>
    <description>Last week for Metatopia @Alun_R , @swordqueen, @JimLikesGames  and I did a panel on Game Facilitator Camp, our community&#39;s program to help GMs (new &amp; old) polish skills and get used to running online. These voluntary workshops have a mentor and 3 participants. They combine Q&amp;As, participant-run sessions, and feedback debriefs. GFC covers safety, specific play culture, technical aspects, and game facilitation skills. In our talk we went over how these work, what the syllabus looks like &amp; lessons we learned from running them. (Big thanks to @Tylom for managing the behind-the-scenes on GFC).
