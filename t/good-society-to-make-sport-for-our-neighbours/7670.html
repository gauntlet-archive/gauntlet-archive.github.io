          <p>“For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?” - Jane Austen,  <em>Pride and Prejudice</em></p>
<p>A place in this game is saved for Elizabeth Hurley.</p>
<p>Good Society is a collaborative rpg that seeks to capture the heart and countenance of Jane Austen’s work. It is a game of balls, estates, sly glances, and turns about the garden. At least on the surface. Underneath this, just as in Austen’s own novels, it is a game of social ambition, family obligation and breathtaking, heart-stopping longing.</p>
<p>In this series we’ll be playing the base game, without any of the various rules expansions. No rules knowledge is required, and all rules will be taught during play. Familiarity with Austen’s work is also not required (but honestly her books are great, do yourself a favour).</p>
<p>Subject matter in the game includes romance, difficult relationships and courtships, and all manner of Regency-era scandal, but shouldn’t include anything that would be out of place in Austen’s work. Period assumptions about class, race and gender may inform the game, although this is something we’ll discuss in our first session (the game includes options for more or less historical accuracy on these and other topics). We’ll also collectively decide on a suitable tone: more or less dramatic, more or less comedic.</p>
<p>We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the x card, and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Sessions will be played over Streamyard, with short breaks on the hour, and will not be recorded.</p>
<p>Signing up for all sessions is strongly encouraged but not required, but you will need to sign up for all sessions you wish to attend. Note there are no sessions on the last weekends in February or March due to prior commitments.</p>
<p>I’ll send an email a week before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials.</p>
<p>Open access time for sign ups will be 7pm 20th December AEDT.</p>
