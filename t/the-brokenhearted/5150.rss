    <description>*You are a Creation.*

*Your Creators brought you into being by science, magic, power, or energy.*

*You are their greatest Creation. But you were a prisoner. Now, you are free.*

*You know they are after you. You know they will find you.*

*You will destroy them. Or they will destroy you.*

*The Brokenhearted* is a game by Tracy Barnett based on For the Queen. You play a Creation who has escaped from their Creators, who now pursue you. You take turns answering questions, learning more about yourself and your creators, until you encounter your pursuers in one final encounter, in which you must either destroy them or be destroyed yourself.

I will be running a one-shot of *This Thing We Started* , a companion game in which you play Creators pursuing their escaped Creation, the previous Monday.

We will be using the X-Card, the Open Table policy, and Lines and Veils as safety tools. Tone will probably be PG-ish.
