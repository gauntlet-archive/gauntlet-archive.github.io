    <description>**The Queen and I -- Part 1 and Part 2 (2-shot)**

&gt; The land you live in has been at war for as long as any of you have been alive.
&gt; The Queen has decided to undertake a long and perilous journey to broker an alliance with a distant power.
&gt; The Queen has chosen all of you, and no one else, to be her retinue, and accompany her on this journey.
&gt; She chose you because she knows that you love her.
&gt; ...
&gt; However, as the journey continues and you learn more about your relationship with the Queen, what will you decide to do when she comes under attack — help to defend or to attack her?

**Session 1 (Aug. 20):** We will play For the Queen to create characters and setting. The ending of For the Queen will serve as setup for the start of session 2.
**Session 2 (Aug. 27):** We will use a barely there rules hack of DramaSystem to play out what happens next for the characters and their queen.
**Note:** Playing both sessions is desirable given the setup from the first session.
**Reserving spots for two players:** Gareth and madelancholy.

About the RPGs:
* A tale of love. A land in peril. For the Queen is a card-based story-building game that you and up to five other players can begin playing in minutes. Choose your queen from among fourteen gorgeously varied illustrations—or start from scratch—and use the prompt cards to collaboratively tell a story of love, betrayal, doubt, and devotion. https://evilhat.com/product/for-the-queen/
* With the Hillfolk roleplaying game, you and your group weave an epic, ongoing saga of high-stakes interpersonal conflict that grows richer with every session. Its DramaSystem rules engine, from acclaimed designer Robin D. Laws, takes the basic structure of interpersonal conflict underlying fiction, movies and television and brings it to the world of roleplaying. This simple framework brings your creativity to the fore and keep a surprising, emotionally compelling narrative constantly on the move. https://pelgranepress.com/hillfolk/
