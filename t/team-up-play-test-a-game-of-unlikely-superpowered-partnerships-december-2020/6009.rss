    <title>Team-Up (Play Test) A game of unlikely superpowered partnerships - December 2020</title>

    <description>Ever since you donned the cape, you’ve worked alone. Partnership isn’t your thing. A sidekick? A student? A “guy in the chair?” They’d just get in the way. Imagine you had a partner when you went after Doctor Virus or Miss Cellany or The Devastation Duo: they would have cramped your style! Yes, you always worked alone.

But that was before. Before this moment, which happens to feature you lying in a bloody mess on the roof of an abandoned building, three members of the Roving Raptors standing over you. They cackle or squawk or whatever. Conniving Condor and Falcon Furious take to the sky. Maybe they’re done with you? But no. The Osprey extends his talons and grabs your limp form, taking to the air. He gonna drop you. You know it. The roof pulls away fast, at a sickening angle, and then goes out of sight, only to reveal the street below. And then you’re falling.

You await the impact of concrete, but it never comes. Instead you find yourself on a glider, Captain Wonder at the controls. She gives you a little salute and revs the engine, made from alien tech she recovered 10 years ago. Everyone knows her story. She flips a switch and eases a control forward, and the glider pursues the murder bird villains.

You sit up, painfully, and with a groan. She turns to look at you, and you manage to squeeze out between gritted teeth, “I work alone.”

Captain Wonder turns back to the controls with a snort. “Sure you do, champ. Sure you do.”

### The Pitch

*Team-Up is a game about unlikely superhero team-ups. It’s about building trust, overcoming differences, and taking down the big boss.*

*This is a playtest of a game currently in development. If you don’t like testing unpolished systems, do not sign up for these sessions. To paraphrase Jammi: the game might not work as expected, but I will try to make sure everyone has fun.*

*One seat of this game is reserved for **Rich Rogers**.*
