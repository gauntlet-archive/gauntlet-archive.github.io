    <description>Hey, guys!

I teach some classes on comics writing for teens in a local University and their favorite bit is by far the creativity exercises we do at the beginning of every class. 

SO, to have some fun and relieve all this pandemic anxiety, I was thinking about an online workshop made up of writing games and exercises. What simple* story games do you think would be best to turn into a writing challenge for a class of about 10 people? And it doesn&#39;t have to be the whole game, but interesting mechanics and pieces, like the setup for Shock: social sci fi.

*The &quot;simple&quot; part is there because I would also have to translate some of the game to Portuguese.

On my list right now I have:
* Purplest Prose (it can be played pretty much as written)
* Dear Elizabeth (a 200 word epistolary rpg they could play in pairs)
* Alone among the stars (solo, the oracle is really nice)
* and I would like to do something with the setup bit of Shock:Social Science Fiction and maybe the tables from Fiasco?

There are other games I would like to play, but it would be hard with this many people (Warrior Poet, CYOA, Mission Accomplished, Highlander II). So I guess it would have to be something they could discuss as a group, but write by themselves?

What do you think? Any suggestions?</description>

              <p>SO! i’m going to hype my own work here because my games are story-driven and narratively focused. I have one that I think would be super good for your students:</p>
<p><a href="https://lhcodega.itch.io/siii-superhero-service-and-support" rel="nofollow noopener">Superhuman Industrial and Immaterial, Inc</a> is a game about being an average person in an above-average city. It’s a choose your own story generator that allows for flexibility, improvisation, and is a story generator. The game is classic and cliche, fun and without a lot of fluff, and the full version takes inspiration from classic comic ads. The anti-comic, comic print.</p>
<p>All you’ll need is a D6 and a way to write/record your answers.</p>
<p>For advanced peeps who want to spend an hour or two with a storygame, there’s <a href="https://lhcodega.itch.io/stardrawn" rel="nofollow noopener">Stardrawn</a>:  A storygame about a galaxy at the end of the war using Tarot cards to build plot, characters, relationships, and interactions.</p>
<p>This is a GM-less game for 1-4 players. You will create characters, bonds, stories, hopes, dreams, and even futures together, using Tarot cards and spreads to explore the galaxy. This is a game about a struggle past and a struggle present, but, as in many stories, there is always hope.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about Stardrawn or want it for class I’ll send you a copy! I love both of these pieces and they’re both oriented towards writers.</p>
<p>Also (sneak peek here) The Gauntlet’s Codex Magazine has a game that encourages writing out the beats that will be released in the Yellow issue!</p>

              <p>Rickard! I found your game last year when searching for material about Kishotenketsu. I never had the chance to play it, but I love the structure and it helped me develop a slice-of-life story I hope will be drawn soon. I was a little insecure about writing a comic book where “nothing happened”, but it turns out I’m pleased with the results (and the phrases at the start of Imagine were part of this). Thank you.</p>

              <p>There’s an writing exercise in which you compose a story from the point of view of an object. I loved how this game go about setting the elements and tone for the story (the OST is so evocative). I’m already adapting this for the workshop, thanks</p>

<p>Lexicon is a computer-assisted role-playing game invented by Neel Krishnaswami and popularised by the indie role-playing game community. As originally proposed, it is played online using wiki software. Players assume the role of scholars who write the history and background of a particular fictitious time, setting, or incident. As the game goes on, the players collaboratively create an elaborately interwoven account.

              <p>Hey, guys!</p>
<p>I teach some classes on comics writing for teens in a local University and their favorite bit is by far the creativity exercises we do at the beginning of every class.</p>
<p>SO, to have some fun and relieve all this pandemic anxiety, I was thinking about an online workshop made up of writing games and exercises. What simple* story games do you think would be best to turn into a writing challenge for a class of about 10 people? And it doesn’t have to be the whole game, but interesting mechanics and pieces, like the setup for Shock: social sci fi.</p>
<p>*The “simple” part is there because I would also have to translate some of the game to Portuguese.</p>
<p>On my list right now I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purplest Prose (it can be played pretty much as written)</li>
<li>Dear Elizabeth (a 200 word epistolary rpg they could play in pairs)</li>
<li>Alone among the stars (solo, the oracle is really nice)</li>
<li>and I would like to do something with the setup bit of Shock:Social Science Fiction and maybe the tables from Fiasco?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other games I would like to play, but it would be hard with this many people (Warrior Poet, CYOA, Mission Accomplished, Highlander II). So I guess it would have to be something they could discuss as a group, but write by themselves?</p>
<p>What do you think? Any suggestions?</p>
