          <p>I present to you the <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2019/09/15/crowdfunding-collection-118/" rel="nofollow noopener">new Crowdfunding Collection #118, including every tabletop rpg project started between 09/09 and 09/15.</a></b></p>
<p>In this collection you’ll finde 8 roleplaying games.<br>
I’ll start with <b>Hyper Light Drifter</b>. The game is based on the videogame by the same name and shares its aesthetics as well as setting. Thus the players will be exploring a post-apocalyptic world with forgotten technologies to discover using a d20 system alongside tactical combat using a mat. The whole game will come in a stylish SNES style packaging and it does look enticing. Then there’s the <b>Otherworlds RPG</b>. It’s a colorful rpg with a varied fantasy setting that has some SF elements here and there. Personally, I like the vampires, of whom some can turn into giant spiders (cool!) and it has a kind of „energetic“ vibe to it which is why I got it starred. In regards to the system it looks rather tradition. <b>Retired</b> on the other hand is a story game that sees two gamers – narrator and a player – exploring the retirement life of a former super villain. The concept sounds fresh as well as interesting and I trust Caias Ward in realizing projects, thus take a look and give it a chance. If you prefer playing heroes maybe <b>Disposable Heroes</b> is better suited to your interest. Though heroes might be a bit optimistic for glorified mail man in this card based PbtA rpg. It does sound interesting. Then there’s <b>Neotoma</b> with it’s original Science Fiction setting with some Sword &amp; Sorcery elements. It does use d12 and d20 for its system, the character sheet looks rather traditional and if you want to learn more you should follow the link to its website. Then there’s <b>SLICE</b>, a rules light game that should be approachable to kids. Well and there’s Ashes of New Earth, which aims to finance the <b>Art</b> for the game.<br>
I wasn’t actually sure how to fit in <b>SQUABBLES</b> or whether it fits at all. The term roleplaying game is used in the more educational to therapeutic sense of trying to teach lessons. In this case how to handl, react and resolve conflicts based on the methods devolped by Brooks Gibbs. It’s still a game, yet not exactly a normal „roleplaying game“.<br>
Among the other projects I am highly enamored with the <b>Story Engine deck</b>. It offers various sets of card to come up with stories including characters, antagonists, aspects, twists and more. I like the idea, presentation, did back it and do recommend having a look. Another project worthwhile checking out is <b>Homunculus Assembly Line</b>, a magazine which is created in a collaboration of 6 artists who all contribute to the project.<br>
There are many more fascinating and cool adventures, sourcebooks, dice and more! Just take a look:</p>

          <p>Hey friends! I’m not sure what the etiquette here is for hyping your own gear, but I’m running the Disposable Heroes Kickstarter, and would be happy to chat about the project if anyone’s got any questions or interest in it. We’re doing some neat stuff with the PbTA system I’d love to expand on - the variable difficulty setting, and the roguelike design in particular.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
