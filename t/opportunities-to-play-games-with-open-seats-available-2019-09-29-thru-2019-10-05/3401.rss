    <description>Hey folks!

In this post, we will highlight games for the upcoming week which have open seats and therefore the opportunity to add some more gaming fun to your week.

### [ Spire: Ironshrike ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LjaN6v8Xk2tvGOzDLHK)

[date=2019-09-29 time=12:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-09-29 time=15:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
We will be playing Spire: The City Must Fall by Grant Howitt and Christopher Taylor. A city of magic, religion and oppression, with you as drow revolutionaries dedicated to rebelling against your aelfir overlords. We&#39;ll be using the Ironshrike scenario, written by Benjamin Brock, as found in the Strata sourcebook. Ironshrike is the market for the desperate, a clot in the commercial bloodstream of the city. Anything possibly of value is for sale though often what&#39;s being sold is dignity and pride. No, Ironshrike is a well of gravity from which its poorest inhabitants find unable to escape, all the while the aelfir up top reap the biggest spoils.. And so, the Ministry has tasked your cell with a simple goal: the murder of a market.

### [ Downfall: Cat Edition ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LmXqXe7uahrUKZRJcUe)

[date=2019-09-30 time=20:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-09-30 time=23:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
&quot;Our home is breaking, and we have no one to blame but ourselves. We built a flawed society, and soon it will destroy itself. Though most of us can’t perceive the coming doom, a Hero arises to fight against the impending collapse. Downfall is the story of how we try to save our society and ourselves, and fail.&quot; Downfall is a game about creating, then destroying, a society. In this session we will be playing with a twist: our society is a society of cats. No prior knowledge of the system is required.

### [ Trophy - No Masters ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LpRIDs3R875WePQ9Of4)

[date=2019-10-01 time=18:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-10-01 time=22:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
Join me to play a one-shot game of Trophy - No Masters: a GM-less modification of Jesse Ross&#39;s awesome game. As with the original, we will play treasure hunters delving into a mysterious forest that doesn&#39;t want us there. The key difference with the original game is that the forest does not take over our minds; rather, it strips away the lies concealing the real motives for our attempted plundering. In other words: The true horror was inside of us all along. (My underlying goal is to promote critical thinking about the rationalizations that we use to justify our exploitation of people and nature.)

### [ Spectaculars: October Issues ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Ln5FrVcQlkpDyA9jFtn)

[date=2019-10-05 time=12:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-10-05 time=15:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
Spectaculars is an episodic super-hero game by Scratchpad Publishing. It explicitly supports drop-in play and quick characters. During the course of a Spectaculars campaign, it&#39;s possible to essentially create several series of comics---street level, magical, Fantastic Four-ish, and Cosmic adventures. In many sessions, new things will be added to the world and decided on by the players.

The world that has currently been build (as of 8/24) has most supers being Veterans who were given powers as part of their deployment. Hearded into ghettos made specifically for them by the GI Bill and kept track of by microchips embeded deep in their sternum and a need to take the medicine &quot;Ten&quot;, which controls their powers and helps with PTSD, they&#39;ve been thrown aside by the country they served.

We&#39;ll decided if we&#39;re doing Street Level, Magic, or Avengers/Xmen at the start of the month. New characters can be made quickly and we&#39;ll play through the issues as we build the story of the world in the Gauntlet&#39;s version of Spectaculars.

### [ L5R: Spring Festival of the Topaz Academy](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LmFccXBS1CGM_xmGgAd)

[date=2019-10-05 time=14:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-10-05 time=17:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
Welcome to the Emerald Republic, a coligation of free peoples fighting for democracy, liberty and self-determination in a world under the control of divine tyrants. (Note: Character creation should be handled before the first session a player joins.)</description>
