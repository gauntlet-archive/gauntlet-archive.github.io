<p>When I talk about the complexity of D&amp;D combat (even, like, Basic D&amp;D, but more like 5e), I‚Äôm not just talking about whittling down hit points, and I think reducing D&amp;D combat to just hit-point accretion either does it a disservice or badly misunderstands its complexity. I assume that anyone in this thread who has played D&amp;D will understand what I mean after a bit of thought, but I‚Äôll break it down for anyone who genuinely doesn‚Äôt understand.</p>

          <p>I like the Encounter rules from The One Ring. They‚Äôre simple, don‚Äôt cover all of your bullet points and are kind of specific to the setting, but I feel they might still help with what you‚Äôre trying to do.</p>
<p>The two features that make them stand out to me are Introductions and Tolerance.</p>
<p>The former simply says that whoever wants to participate in a social situation has to introduce themself first. NPCs have a (usually secret, might be inferred though) preference of whether they wish to interact with a single spokesperson for the adventuring party or whether they‚Äôd like everyone to introduce themself.</p>
<p>Tolerance is either a number of rolls that the party may collectively fail until they‚Äôve overstaid their welcome and the encounter ends. Or the number of rolls they are allowed to make/points they may raise (that‚Äôs a house rule variant I like). Calculating Tolerance counts in social standing, customs, the immediate situation and so on. There is another house rule variant, where the manner in which the encounter ends when the party runs out of Tolerance is cleverly tied to the lands they‚Äôre in. In Free Lands for example, there will be a polite close to conversations while in Shadow Lands you will be threatened with violence and essentially never talked to again.</p>
<p>[House rules by Ralph Mazza, Paul Beakley, Ara Winter. They‚Äôre probably still available from them.]</p>

          <p>Or moves?</p>
<p>Blades is, of course specifically about scoundrels and would take some adapting to be what you want. Still, these moves are more than ‚Äúroll dice, tick a clock‚Äù. The clock is to obstacles in Blades as hit points are to combat in D&amp;D ‚Äì the baseline that is changed by abilities. Instead of Sleep and Bless spells, we gotta look to the moves.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a few moves that do that, taken from the Blades online SRD:</p>
<h3>Like looking into a mirror</h3>
<p>You can always tell when someone is lying to you.</p>
<h3>Leader</h3>
<p>When you Command a  <strong>cohort</strong>  in combat, they continue to fight when they would otherwise  <strong>break</strong>  (they‚Äôre not taken out when they suffer level 3 harm). They gain  <strong>+1 effect</strong>  and  <strong>1 armor</strong> .</p>
<h3>Mesmerism</h3>
<p>When you Sway someone, you may cause them to forget that it‚Äôs happened until they next interact with you.</p>
<h3>Subterfuge</h3>
<p>You may expend your  <strong>special armor</strong>  to resist a consequence from suspicion or persuasion, or to  <strong>push yourself</strong>  for subterfuge.</p>
<h3>Trust in me</h3>
<p>You get  <strong>+1d</strong>  vs. a target with whom you have an intimate relationship.</p>
<h3>Weaving the web</h3>
<p>You gain  <strong>+1d</strong>  to Consort when you gather information on a target for a score. You get  <strong>+1d</strong>  to the  <strong>engagement roll</strong>  for that operation.</p>

          <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/thomas_junk">@Thomas_Junk</a> I‚Äôll peek at that!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/julian">@Julian</a> That‚Äôs a very cool mechanic. Worth stealing and reusing for when I inevitably write my own game to do what I want.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/william_nichols">@William_Nichols</a>:</p>
<p>Yeah, that stuff is all cool, and I can see that it‚Äôs definitely more complicated than ‚Äúone and done‚Äù systems for interpersonal interactions, but I don‚Äôt see how it handles any of the larger scale stuff I want to do.</p>
<p>I have a setting based on 1300 AD Hungary, which faced a ten-year interregnum during which time ‚ÄúBaron Palatines‚Äù (oligarchs) ruled giant swaths of the country and jockeyed to place their choice of dude on the throne. At least four different people made some claim to the throne, with the Pope backing one and a bunch of barons backing one other.</p>
<p>So I have to figure out how PCs can play kingmaker. Some of it may be by sword or by spell, but I think a lot of it can come down to influence peddling, and I want to model that fairly strongly. I could turn it into a series of a hundred NPC interactions but that‚Äôs probably not optimal.</p>
<p>I also have this idea of growing (PC) fame that I‚Äôd like to model somehow. Because of their deeds, PCs are literally impressing spirits into bonding with them, giving them power. If they can awe spirits, they‚Äôre probably gobsmacking villagers. I‚Äôd like to know how PCs can use their fame to sway crowds or organizations. The <em>Leader</em> move looks cool to make a cohort fight, but it doesn‚Äôt make them elect the 13-year-old girl as Queen of Junnia.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>Okay, dude, this is awesome. The first page of the Moves document already addresses some of my ‚Äúnot psychopathic‚Äù social interaction concerns. Its heart is in the right place but it still treats NPCs as objects to be manipulated, but it‚Äôs a lot softer than a lot of mechanics.</p>
<p>(There seems to be this belief among game designers that you can just wield personal charisma as a sharp sword to make people do what you want, without consequence. Building rapport really doesn‚Äôt work that way.)</p>
<p>I do love the idea of essentially marking stress (‚Äúelements‚Äù in the text) when you won‚Äôt do what people are pressuring you to do, and then an Inner Conflict move that forces you to deal with the stress you‚Äôve let build up.</p>
<p>I think there are some great ideas in Hearts of Wulin to mine for my inevitable game design quest.</p>

          <p>hey Adam ‚Äì</p>
<p>Nice. Agreed, you‚Äôre going to need new moves to fit the specific theme and scope you‚Äôre looking for. Regarding scope; that‚Äôs what tier is for, basically. The Faction game is all about what you‚Äôre thinking about, namely:<br>
‚Äì It‚Äôs not wielded like a sword: If you don‚Äôt honor your commitments to other factions, they like you less. That is, if you treat an Ally like you don‚Äôt care about them, they will do the same.<br>
‚Äì As Tier increases, so does your sway. A Tier 0 faction has gangs of a couple of people with crappy equipment and nobody knows them, while a Tier 4 faction has large gangs and a lot of sway.</p>
<p>Hearts of Wulin is likely also your jam! There‚Äôs a lot of good design out there to steal from.</p>
