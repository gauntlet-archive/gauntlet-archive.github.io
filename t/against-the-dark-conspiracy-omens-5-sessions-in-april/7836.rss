    <title>Against The Dark Conspiracy: Omens (5 sessions in April)</title>

    <description>***I’m saving one spot in this game for someone who hasn’t played a regular series on the Gauntlet before. If that’s you, please message me to take the spot. If nobody does, I’ll take the first player from the wait list a week before the first session.***

Europe in the 70s. Cold War, oil crisis, recession, the collapse of liberation movements and the decline of social democracy: but now you’ve learned that even darker forces are at work. Omens and hard-won intel alike tell you a vast and powerful demonic conspiracy are plotting to birth an Antichrist and end the world. You are the only ones skilled and ruthless enough to stop them: a ragtag bunch of burned spies, mercenaries and criminals. 

This is a light reskin that sets Alun’s Against The Dark Conspiracy in the 1970s, drawing inspiration from the era’s Satanic horror films (The Omen, Rosemary’s Baby, etc) and political thrillers (Day of the Jackal, Marathon Man, etc). Because the game involves collaboratively generating the group’s missions during play, a little familiarity with those or similar touchstones and 70s tropes generally will be helpful. No rules knowledge is required, and all rules will be explained during play. 

Subject matter in this game includes Horror, Gore, Risk to loved ones, demons and christian iconography and lore, Tension between player characters, Intimacy between player characters, Verbal or physical abuse between player characters, Drug and alcohol abuse by player characters, Verbal or physical abuse of non-player characters by player characters, Intimacy between player characters and non-player characters.

We’ll be using the x card, lines and veils and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

Signing up for all sessions is encouraged but not required. Please sign up for all sessions you wish to attend. 

Sessions will be run over Zoom with short breaks on the hour. If the players agree I’ll record the sessions for my own use (bc I’m terrible at taking notes) but won’t post them publicly. 

I’ll send out an email a week before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials.
