    <title>Gateway RPGs in different countries</title>

    <description>I wasnt 100% sure whether to put this here or in rpg chat, but I believe its design related, so I did here.
Some time ago I started to try and get information about gateway games - games which were the first that kickstarted rpg community in a given country (or more then one, if that&#39;s the case). I believe that first popular game is usually the one that becomes the point of reference, and also shapes design trends and community.
I know that in US and many many countries it was D&amp;D, but for example in Poland it was Warhammer.

This is what I got so far:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iysoHG8xatjRitpMor6qGUN2bOCLg2XSx86rKSKLD8Q/edit?usp=sharing

I would welcome any additional info (doc its editable), and also discussion on how games in different countries inspired design trends and community there.

EDIT:
Games I got at the moment of posting:
|Country|Gateway games|
|---|---|
|Poland|Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay|
|Germany|Die Schwarze Auge|
|Sweden|Drakar och Demoner (CoC/BRP inspired)|
|France|D&amp;D / Die Schwarze Auge|
|Japan|Sword World|
|Spain|D&amp;D (to be confirmed)|
|Israel|D&amp;D (to be confirmed)|
|Brazil|GURPS and Vampire the Masquerade|
|Russia|Russian gateway game was Age of Aquarius (local developed) in early 00-th. And Savage Worlds from 2011 till now.|
|Norway|The red and blue box of BEMCI D&amp;D was translated into Norwegian in the mid &#39;80s. Also the Norwegian edition of Drakar och Demoner.|
|New Zealand|D&amp;D (Red Box and later)|
|Austria|Die Schwarze Auge|</description>

              <p>I’m from Poland as well and my history absolutely confirms both your points: the first game I ever played was WFRP in mid 90s, the first game I ever owned and ran was Vampire the Masquerade, which I got in the late 90s. So as far as I’m concerned, you’re both right. BTW, I didn’t have any contact with DnD until many, many years later and even then it hardly made any impact on me, but I know I’m an outlier in this respect.</p>

D&amp;D gave us another big wave though.</p>

              <p>In Hungary MAGUS used to be the gateway game (it was a D&amp;D-esque, class-and-level game with damage reducing armour, mana points, and its built-in world supported by multiple fantasy novels), especially in the 90s. Then, it was either Vampire: the Masquarade (3rd edition) or D&amp;D 3.0. Nowadays, I <em>think</em> it’s D&amp;D 5E, but I’m not entirely sure.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>WRT Poland it depends on “when?” as mainstream games changed over time. There is an old current (some would say an infamous one) of what’s known as “jesienna gawęda” (Autumn Tale/Fable) which is pretty hard to explain but can be simplified to “deep games are all about suffering and pain and you want your game to be deep”. This led to WFRP tradition of gloomy ambience, rain, mud and world void of hope. I barely touched Warh so I don’t know if this is at all what authors intended. I suppose not.</p>
<p>Whether this contributed or not, IDK, but Poland was WoD heavy for a long time. I’d go as far as claim that VtM penetrated mainstream more than WFRP ever did attracting people of all genders (but that could just be my POV so take it with a grain of salt). This was around late '90s.</p>
<p>Then once D&amp;D 3ed got translated I suspect it became the gateway drug. WFRP was long out of print and D&amp;D guides (dm/player ones) were claimed to be the best selling rpg books ever.</p>
<p>There’s a helfy contingent of BW and AW gamers post 2010 which were very active but I didn’t pay attention any more so don’t know if this became the new common “first”.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that Poland had it’s first local RPG syndicated in a popular rpg magazine (Kryształy Czasu/Stones-or-Gems-or-Crystals of Time). I know people who started with it but I think WFRP was more commonly run for newcomers. Poland is also heavy into post-apo (it had one of the largest Fallout scenes out there) which led to a game that fused jesienna gawęda with post-apo looting: Neuroshima. It was huge at one point and was a gateway rpg for many video game fans turn roleplayers.</p>
<p>But this is all my perception and I don’t have the numbers so Warhammer in the spreadsheet is probably a safe bet. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>I wasnt 100% sure whether to put this here or in rpg chat, but I believe its design related, so I did here.<br>
Some time ago I started to try and get information about gateway games - games which were the first that kickstarted rpg community in a given country (or more then one, if that’s the case). I believe that first popular game is usually the one that becomes the point of reference, and also shapes design trends and community.<br>
I know that in US and many many countries it was D&amp;D, but for example in Poland it was Warhammer.</p>
