    <title>No Where to Hide - Unincorporated (Playtest)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/no-where-to-hide-unincorporated-playtest/6953</link>
    <description>CONTENT WARNING: Small town small mindedness, drugs, abuse, abuse of power, feeling trapped.

DESCRIPTION: This will be a one-shot of Unincorporated which is currently being playtested. Unincorporated is a game by Bethany Harvey about being stuck together in a small community with a limited pool of other people. The characters are ordinary people caught up in petty dramas, grudges, and hopeless love affairs, while trying to shake off the weight of their reputations and define who they are for themselves. This is a GMless game.

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, and the Open Door Policy. The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct will also be in effect. (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html). All games should follow this.).
