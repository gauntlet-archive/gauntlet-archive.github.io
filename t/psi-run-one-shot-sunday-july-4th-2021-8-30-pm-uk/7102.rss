*A space in this game is being held for Vicki Kim*

Psi*Run by Meg Baker is a low-prep, GMed roleplaying game designed to explore the stories of amnesiac psychics fleeing relentless pursuers. 
https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-McPnojC9rdBhE6EbuA4

Whoever’s after you, you know one thing: they will stop at nothing to capture you and you’ll stop at nothing to stay free. The holes in your memory vie for attention with your startling abilities - stay one step ahead of the Chasers long enough to answer your questions, and hope your psychic powers don’t go wild.

They took your life.

You got away.

They want you back.

Run!

These sessions will use:

- a content &#39;palette&#39; incorporating Lines &amp; Veils

- X-card

- active check-ins where requested

These sessions follow The Gauntlet’s Code of Conduct.
