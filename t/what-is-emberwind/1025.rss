    <title>What is Emberwind?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/what-is-emberwind/1025</link>
    <description>Has anyone played it? Do you like it? Why or why not? It looks pretty neat to me. Good production values and I love that it&#39;s Canadian. You can play with a GM or not. What little reviews I&#39;ve seen have been positive.
