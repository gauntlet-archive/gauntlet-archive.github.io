    <description>
It seems that most/(all?) of the planned upcoming gaming sessions will be recorded or the host would prefer to record them. This feels a bit daunting to me after being out of roleplaying for a while, so interested in why there’s an emphasis on recording gameplay. Any background would help me get my head wrapped around the idea. Thanks!</description>

              <p>I think that’s a great analogy and pretty much sums up why I prefer to play in sessions that are not recorded. However if you don’t want to join games because of privacy concerns, you shouldn’t worry: If you join a game on the Gauntlet and you don’t want the recording of the session to be made public everyone will honor your request.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all your thoughts.</p>
<p>This helped me better understand this community, for instance the emphasis on designing games and improving being the DM.</p>
<p>It sounds like in many cases the <em>intention</em> of recording is for private review (mostly by those who participate or this community). I have no reservations about that, but the issue is that using YouTube for example is not private. Are most recordings just privately available?</p>
<p>I see where the concept of using a pseudonym / avatar comes from, but I would assume the primary goal is for the enjoyment of those playing the game in that session (?). For me at least, I would like for everyone playing to see who I am and my real name   (assuming everyone was ok with that and people were sharing video).</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

              <p>I actually share your discomfort with recordings and would like to see more sessions on the Gauntlet without recording them. There is this weird element of performing <strong>for</strong> someone else who is not at the virtual table instead of playing <strong>with</strong> the people who actually are there that bothers me - although the feeling always fades into the background after playing for like 5 minutes. Personally I only record sessions if I think that there hasn’t been an actual play of that specific game or scenario on the internet.</p>

              <p>What <a class="mention" href="/u/blakeryan">@BlakeRyan</a> &amp; <a class="mention" href="/u/jesseabe">@Jesseabe</a> said but, personally, I like to review the recordings of sessions I run as part of a personal development process as a GM.  Sometimes during a session I spot a player’s attention drifting or I’m conscious of my own failure to keep the game moving at the pace I aim for, or leave a session thinking ‘that was OK, but …’. Because I have the recording I can review it to ask ‘what would have been better?’.</p>
<p>Also, as someone who writes games then my sessions are often playtests so a recording to check if mechanics and narrative are meshing as I imagined are really useful. To be honest, those recordings are also helpful in engaging people and illustrating how the game plays in practice … I edited transcripts to put together ‘examples from play’ to include in my last game (Against the Dark Conspiracy).</p>
<p>Playing without video and using a pseudonym is an effective way to separate professional and gaming life, for instance, if that’s a concern.</p>
<p>Finally, the Gauntlet is one of the most sensitive and supportive groups I’ve ever played with, so don’t worry about being a bit rusty or not reaching some sort of ‘performance’ level … this is emphatically not Critical Roll or its ilk.</p>

<p>Our memories are not perfect. I played and ran hundreds of sessions in the 90s that are all a blur now.</p>
<p>Since we have the option to record them, we get to keep a copy of the wonderful interactive dynamic stories we create, thus it seems bizarre to me not to record them.</p>
<p>Had one friend who was self conscious about his appearance and wanted a clear divide between his gaming and work life, so we used a nickname and profile pic instead of live video feed for him, worked fine.</p>
<p>Lastly, i’d rather watch or listen to actual play than the predictable capitalist biased garbage on commercial tv any day of the week.</p>

              <p>Speaking only for myself, I like to record for a few reasons 1) it’s a more accurate record I can use to prep the next session, I don’t have to rely on notes.  2) I have found the Gauntlet’s library of recordings extremely useful in a few ways. They provide me examples of skilled play that aren’t highly edited or produced APs, I get to see how the game plays out with a generally normal group of players that isn’t really trying to play to an audience outside the table. I can learn about the game from watching the video. It’s also just fun to watch my friends play games. I record to contribute to that library and pay it back a bit. 3)If I’m trying out something new, or play testing a hack, it’s helpful to me to be able review video and see how it went from the outside.</p>
<p>All of that said, if a player doesn’t want to record, I don’t and that’s a community wide rule.</p>
