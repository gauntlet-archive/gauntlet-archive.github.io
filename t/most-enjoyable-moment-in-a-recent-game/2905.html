          <p>We made characters for a game of Sig, and the players have a duty to pair up and create NPCs for me (the GM) to pay. I have a large group of people, and it‚Äôs noisy, so I mostly help the players nearby figure out their NPC, then work around to the far side of the table.</p>
<p>The first ones are fine: He‚Äôs a talking frog that‚Äôs the captain of the city watch. Cool. And a fire elemental priest of sorrow, and a paranoid librarian. All pretty typical for how the game works.</p>
<p>Then we get to Blarrk. Blarrk is a giant flying tumor with hundreds of eyes. Once every hour, he shouts prophecies and unwelcome truths in the town square. They couldn‚Äôt decide if Blarrk had one huge shouty mouth, or one thousand tiny whispering mouths, so they rolled a die. (They got one big shouty mouth.)</p>

          <p>I was running a <em>Monster of the Week</em> one shot recently, and one of the players was playing the Divine and had chosen the following Mission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The  End  of  Days  approaches.  Your  role  is  to  guide  these hunters and ensure it comes to pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn‚Äôt pass this up, so it turned out the underground lair of the Monster (an ancient wolf spirit and its werewolf children) contained one of the seals of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>We ended up in a three way stand off between the Divine (who wanted to open the seal), the monster (who wanted to destroy everyone who had seen the seal), and the hunters, who just wanted to get out of the situation.</p>
<p>Everyone had a great time and it made me wish that I was local so we could keep going with this story.</p>

          <p>Playing Undying.</p>
<p>We (three players) spent the whole night scheming against the Princeps to overthrow him. We had everything planned - who would be new the Princeps, new Patricians, the new hunting grounds division, etc.</p>
<p>On the final showdown we have the Princeps and his pawns cornered. The win seems guaranteed. Every player put firsts forward with hidden amounts of Blood wagered to the fight (GM included, representing the Princeps). Then, at the GM signal, everybody opens it up simulataneously. We add the values and it‚Äôs an easy win for us.</p>
<p>Except‚Ä¶</p>
<p>One player wagers on the Princeps side, describing his character turning on us in the fight. A betrayer. He turned sides at the last moment, it seems. We lost the fight, the two losing players (me included) becoming Pariahs.</p>
<p>It came so out of nowhere, and in the right timing, that it was marvelous. Even the GM was taken completely by surprise. One of the best sessions we had ever for sure.</p>

          <p>In The Spectaculars, our support group/neighborhood watch tracked a group of bank robbers to their warehouse hideout. Our top priority is not to get the cops involved, so we decide to approach openly, carrying bags of take-out, and see if we can peacefully resolve the situation through talk. The metas invite us in, my teen hero Sp√øwn flies down dramatically from a nearby rooftop with his costume billowing gently, flashing finger-guns at their lookout, and immediately asks Timberwolf, the one with a cool cybernetic wolf companion, for a selfie. GM describes how she sighs and strikes a pose with the wolf. ‚ÄúGreat. I immediately tweet that out.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Running Lady Blackbird, and Vance heads the Owl to Nightport to meet his ex-wife, who wanted him to leave the Empire years ago when he didn‚Äôt want to, but was so done with him that when he went renegade she had no use for him. I grab the name list and come up with Jezebel as just the right name for her. Vance‚Äôs player says she‚Äôs in the Crimson Sky pirates.</p>
<p>So they hit Nightport and Vance goes to a bar and orders the drink that‚Äôs actually a code word. ‚ÄúLove to serve that to you,‚Äù says the barkeep, ‚ÄúBut things are quiet now. One of the capos opened up a nightclub, and now Everybody goes to Jezzies‚Äô.‚Äù</p>
<p>What follows is twenty minutes of me riffing on a Lady Blackbird-style Rick‚Äôs Cafe Americain, down to a guy named Ugarte selling a possible imperial navigation document into the scatters, a goblin harpsichordist named Samel, and Jezzie‚Äôs entry line: ‚ÄúOf all the skytch saloons and all the gin joints in the Wild Blue, you had to walk into mine.‚Äù</p>

          <p>In my ongoing 5E dungeoncrawl set in ‚ÄúThe magical lands of Feary‚Äù the party of former wedding caterers, distant ‚Äúwood fey‚Äù cousins and changeling descendants has decided to remake themselves as hardboiled fixers. They have this endearing combination of ruthless pragmatism and utter terrified (admittedly two are ‚Äòrabbitmen‚Äô former bandits) fecklessness.</p>
<p>In this weekend‚Äôs session they wrapped up their infiltration of a Redcap briar fortress, using some wild schemes (recruiting giant crow allies, disguising themselves as town militia, overfeeding the giant spider cavalry mounts to make them torpid, poisoning the well, wedging shut the barracks doors) while running about commando style - and amazingly avoiding and distracting patrols - they find themselves face to face with the tower‚Äôs lord, their assassination (overreaching - he‚Äôs the cousin of their royal patron and they weren‚Äôt told to assassinate him, just disrupt his mortal stealing scheme) target.  They‚Äôre all ready to go when the Redcap noble predictably grows in size - and keeps growing - suddenly they find themselves facing a giant sized forest spirte made of root burls and dried heartsblood.  The party fires an arrow and spell or two but then just decides to flee.</p>
<p>Pursued by the rallying defenders (somewhat hampered by the party‚Äôs past efforts) the adventurers are justifying their change of plans and keep running down the spiral stairs, past the entry level into the caves below the briar.  They manage to get a few doors between themselves and the angry redcaps, the spiderknechts are especially peeved as thier mounts are bloated and unwilling to ride, and decide that rather they need to both escape and burn the entire place down.  The rest of the session was spent creating an elaborate trap involving the fortress booze store and broken furniture, and arguing with a magic postern gate that would only believe logical fallacies. Eventually the party no true Scotsman‚Äôs the door open with ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be a real gate, because a real gate must open as well as remain barred‚Äù and flees, leaving behind fuse burning to the wine cellar.</p>
<p>They also didn‚Äôt steal anything valuable - they were so into their self imposed commando mission and didn‚Äôt want to risk theft being noticed, so no XP.</p>

          <p>GMing Blades for a party of two. They get asked by the Gray Cloaks to go hide a spooky ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let it touch your skin‚Äù artifact in the Billhooks‚Äô lair (a butcher shop), then go back a week later and retrieve it, no questions asked. Crew agrees, and Hix (not normally the planner of the two) immediately has a plan. He walks right in there, asks to use the bathroom, stuffs the artifact down the toilet, and then makes a Wreck roll.</p>
<p>Crits.</p>
<p>So he comes out of the bathroom apologizing profusely, all the Billhooks on site vacate the premises, and they board up the bathroom door. A week later Hix comes back, apologizing again and again, and offers to fix the toilet up for free. They‚Äôre not happy to see him but allow it. Rolls himself a Tinker.</p>
<p>Crits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Arden‚Äôs been using all this bathroom time to chat up the head of the Billhooks. Takes him out to a nice Skovlan restaurant, they make out in the alley while they‚Äôre waiting on the food, and long story short now he‚Äôs one of Arden‚Äôs Friends, and the crew is friendly with the Billhooks.</p>

          <p>I was running a cyberpunk game for a friend and he rolled a trans man character, somehow it felt good for me to share him parts of my personal experience when I described him stuff through a trans person point of view. It was the first time this ever happened to me, being able to use my personal experience as a trans person in a RPG game to describe the world. It was not much, just small details there and there but I don‚Äôt know, it made the game session more interesting for me. I think that the sci-fi setting helped me a bit to approach this lightly.</p>
