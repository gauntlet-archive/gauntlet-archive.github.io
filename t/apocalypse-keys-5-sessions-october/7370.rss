    <description>**This is a 5 session series of Apocalypse Keys Playtest Edition.**

You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Prior experience isn&#39;t required, all rules will be taught in play. The game will not be recorded. We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils, the X-Card and the Open Table safety tools.

APOCALYPSE KEYS is a Powered by the Apocalypse game about monsters holding back the apocalypse. They are agents who work for the DIVISION, a mysterious organization dedicated to understanding the occult, taming the supernatural, and protecting the world. A world that is built for the mundane and for humans. A world that tries to pretend that monsters are not real. It is mainly inspired by Hellboy, the films and comics, as well as the spin off comic series B.P.R.D. that focuses on the other monstrous agents. But this game also leans into the other stories and genres that focus on investigating the strange and weird.
