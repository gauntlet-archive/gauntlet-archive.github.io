    <description>If you had to give just one piece of advice for new GMs, what would it? Something you learned along the way that you discovered right away or wished you knew earlier. This came from a convo we had last night around a specific point that @RichRogers told me that changed my GMing for the better. 

Always address questions to specific players. Don&#39;t drop open-ended questions on the table. It&#39;s true f2f, but especially online. You cut out dead air and keep the scene&#39;s momentum. This works, even if you&#39;re asking something like &quot;What does the group want to do next?&quot;. Ask that, but address it to a specific player &quot;What do you want to do next, let&#39;s start with Sherri&#39;s thoughts&quot; and so on.

Obviously there&#39;s exceptions to this, but as a general principle, I think it holds up. Learning this, ***deep*** into my GMing career, made me better at it. 

Some what&#39;s the **one** piece of advice you would give?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>A few things come to mind for me which I haven’t seen other people mention (I’ll try not to be redundant here):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Play with honesty and clarity. Try to make sure that costs, consequences, and considerations are always clear to the players, at all times. Practice transparency of method and clarity of communication: there is enough murk and confusion in real life, human communication, and a fictional reality that working extra hard to be clear is always welcome. Do say, “if you do that, you might knock the Wookie off the cliff - we’ll probably have her make a Dexterity check - are you OK with that?”, or “if you fail this roll, you could lose some hit points, which will make it harder to use your spells until the end of the session”, or perhaps, “…you should know that if any of you decide to attempt the archery challenge, we’ll resolve it using a Long Contest where none of your Personal Traits will apply.” Also say, “John, I’m setting up a scary scene where you’ll have little say over the outcome - are you cool with that?”, as well as, “I’m really curious to see where Lando’s loyalties lie, so in this session, I’m going to lean on that extra hard. OK? Lando’s player, is it cool if the other players pitch in on that too, adding even more pressure to your character?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along the same lines, don’t be “mysterious” or put on an unreadable poker face. Cheer, boo, laugh at the stuff that’s happening and tell the players how you feel about it. Maybe it’s a case of saying, “Wow, I can’t believe Rogar pulled off that stunt! I never thought he could, and that was one of my favourite moments in this session!”, in order to celebrate a major success with a player. Or maybe it’s a case of saying, “Wow, Duke Dooku is such an asshole. Even though he’s my NPC, I will probably be dreaming about throttling him in my sleep. I hope he gets his just desserts in the end!” Share. Don’t be quiet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen to your players even when you might not be supposed to, and take as much of their input as possible into the game. When they shout out suggestions, say, “Yes! That’s exactly what happens!” more often than not. Your games will be better for it and your players will be more involved and more invested. (But also know your games well enough to know the moments where you <em>shouldn’t</em> do so! Know the places and times where that would undercut the creative goals of your game.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When prepping for a game, try to limit yourself to material that’s already been introduced by the players. For instance, if you need a “bad guy”, look through the character sheets first, and see if any character has a hated enemy or a nemesis or a father figure who died during the Clone Wars, and bring that in, rather than making something up whole cloth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of my best game experiences have come from making a rule for myself not to introduce or prep <em>anything</em> that doesn’t come from or flow directly from something on a character sheet or that a player has said. It makes GMing feel so easy, and leads to such consistent quality!</p>

              <p>I tell them that I aim to create what some call “Grand Argument Stories.”</p>
<p>Granted, doing so simply as an author is severe enough. Doing so with random variables, including human behavior, makes ending an RPG “campaign” or series of sessions resolve into a coherent story, even a bad one, improbable.</p>
<p>It’s not quite as “bad” as the universe coming from an ex nihilo explosion, but it’s up there.</p>
<p>In the interests of transparency, of late, my forays into the “GM” world have been few. Not many people want to do stories or, more to the point, they want to do stories <em>and</em> whatever they want in a game.</p>
<p>Can’t do both, and most players read that as “railroading,” when all but perhaps the most chaotic sandbox that permits almost anything could face the same charges for the same causes.</p>
<p>This isn’t a bad thing, however. You want your gun to fail at the gate, not in sector, and there’s no point in anyone joining that doesn’t want, or doesn’t get, what you’re trying to do.</p>
<p>“Win/win, or no deal.”</p>
<p>Expectations are a bear. Best to kill them young and small, unless they serve, or at least don’t obstruct, everyone’s purposes for playing.</p>

I spent so many games afraid to let things change unless the PC’s were directly involved. Now I build precarious situations, factions at each other’s throats, families one week away from ruin. And to follow through on that motion. If the PCs don’t interact with these elements, I can still let them feel the ripples of those events in the background. If they do, the interaction between their characters and the status quo’s inbuilt tension leads to much more dynamic narratives than either alone.</p>

<p>I think “collaborative storytelling” would be clear to a lot of people and implies a lot about a game. I’m always looking for new ways people might describe what they want from play. Especially ways to describe it for folks who are maybe new to RPGs and don’t have as many points of reference.</p>
<p>But I think what you called out about these not being “mutually exclusive axes” is important. There’s no reason you can’t like all these styles for different reasons.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is “collaborative storytelling” too simple? I agree that there are definitely different style of DMing, and a lot of the immediate descriptors I think of aren’t mutually exclusive axes.You could describe your style as “reactive vs.proactive”, “antagonistic vs. cooperative”, “structured vs. sandbox”, “rules heavy vs. rules light”,  and/or “narrative vs. crunchy” and any combination of those factors could be a valid style.</p>

<p>For example, most gamers that this writer encounters think that RPGs are storytelling games when they are not. If one is gaming to “tell a story,” it is like that itch never quite scratched.</p>
<p>One can “do a story” with RPGs, at least in theory; this writer is not contending otherwise. However, being unaware of what each thing is, thinking that one thing <em>is</em> another thing when it is not by default is a recipe for disillusionment and walkaways.</p>

Being able to talk things through with your players as equals is incredibly valuable.</p>

              <p>I really like the advice in Trollbabe from pages 15-22 on creating adventure scenarios, and it made a big difference for me when I read it. It’s pretty simple and probably has been stated in other ways, but it really helped me see the potential drama in different scenarios.</p>
<p>It basically boils down to picking a person, place, or thing which is the “stakes”. And then you add to that two or more people or groups who disagree about what should happen in regards to the stakes.</p>
<p>So for instance imagine a human village and a troll village which are situated close to one another. The trolls have a strict “no eating humans” rule, but a troll named Blorg eats one anyway. Now Blorg is the “stakes” of the adventure, since the humans and some trolls want her killed while some of the other trolls want to protect her. And Blorg herself very much wants to stay alive (and who knows maybe there were extenuating circumstances). What will happen, will our heroes get involved? What do they think should happen?</p>

              <p>This is not a generally applicable advice, but only what eased my own GMing anxiety. I personally found that transparency and setting the “right amount of” expectation really helped my StoryGame play, or at least gave me the confidence to run storygames without being perfect at it (rules, facilitation, improv) first. This probably won’t work for traditional tactical games.</p>
<p>Transparency: I tell everyone almost everything about my thoughts and plans as appropriate, I say things like “I don’t yet have a solid idea of where things are going (I don’t mean have a story/ending in mind), but we’ll ease into it and I’ll hopefully connect the dots soon.” Downside is it does hurt players’ enjoyment somewhat if they liked that tension of not knowing but expect to be pleasantly surprised…</p>
<p>Setting Expectation: From Same Page Tool, CATS and Safety Tool discussions overall, I learned to really examine what I want from a game and then try to express that in the pitch (or through answering questions), so that more players can make informed decisions before agreeing to play. And if everyone know they can veto ideas during a game (reasonably), the story can venture into territories otherwise untouchable. I still don’t do this well enough with people I have more familiarity with (such that I know their preferences ahead of time), but we talk more often outside of the games that I can check in more often.</p>
