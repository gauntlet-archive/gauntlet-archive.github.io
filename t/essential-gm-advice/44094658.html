<p>I think ‚Äúcollaborative storytelling‚Äù would be clear to a lot of people and implies a lot about a game. I‚Äôm always looking for new ways people might describe what they want from play.

I spent so many games afraid to let things change unless the PC‚Äôs were directly involved. Now I build precarious situations, factions at each other‚Äôs throats, families one week away from ruin. And to follow through on that motion. If the PCs don‚Äôt interact with these elements, I can still let them feel the ripples of those events in the background. If they do, the interaction between their characters and the status quo‚Äôs inbuilt tension leads to much more dynamic narratives than either alone.</p>

          <p>I tell them that I aim to create what some call ‚ÄúGrand Argument Stories.‚Äù</p>
<p>Granted, doing so simply as an author is severe enough. Doing so with random variables, including human behavior, makes ending an RPG ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù or series of sessions resolve into a coherent story, even a bad one, improbable.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not quite as ‚Äúbad‚Äù as the universe coming from an ex nihilo explosion, but it‚Äôs up there.</p>
<p>In the interests of transparency, of late, my forays into the ‚ÄúGM‚Äù world have been few. Not many people want to do stories or, more to the point, they want to do stories <em>and</em> whatever they want in a game.</p>
<p>Can‚Äôt do both, and most players read that as ‚Äúrailroading,‚Äù when all but perhaps the most chaotic sandbox that permits almost anything could face the same charges for the same causes.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt a bad thing, however. You want your gun to fail at the gate, not in sector, and there‚Äôs no point in anyone joining that doesn‚Äôt want, or doesn‚Äôt get, what you‚Äôre trying to do.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWin/win, or no deal.‚Äù</p>
<p>Expectations are a bear. Best to kill them young and small, unless they serve, or at least don‚Äôt obstruct, everyone‚Äôs purposes for playing.</p>

          <p>A few things come to mind for me which I haven‚Äôt seen other people mention (I‚Äôll try not to be redundant here):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Play with honesty and clarity. Try to make sure that costs, consequences, and considerations are always clear to the players, at all times. Practice transparency of method and clarity of communication: there is enough murk and confusion in real life, human communication, and a fictional reality that working extra hard to be clear is always welcome. Do say, ‚Äúif you do that, you might knock the Wookie off the cliff - we‚Äôll probably have her make a Dexterity check - are you OK with that?‚Äù, or ‚Äúif you fail this roll, you could lose some hit points, which will make it harder to use your spells until the end of the session‚Äù, or perhaps, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know that if any of you decide to attempt the archery challenge, we‚Äôll resolve it using a Long Contest where none of your Personal Traits will apply.‚Äù Also say, ‚ÄúJohn, I‚Äôm setting up a scary scene where you‚Äôll have little say over the outcome - are you cool with that?‚Äù, as well as, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really curious to see where Lando‚Äôs loyalties lie, so in this session, I‚Äôm going to lean on that extra hard. OK? Lando‚Äôs player, is it cool if the other players pitch in on that too, adding even more pressure to your character?‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along the same lines, don‚Äôt be ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù or put on an unreadable poker face. Cheer, boo, laugh at the stuff that‚Äôs happening and tell the players how you feel about it. Maybe it‚Äôs a case of saying, ‚ÄúWow, I can‚Äôt believe Rogar pulled off that stunt! I never thought he could, and that was one of my favourite moments in this session!‚Äù, in order to celebrate a major success with a player. Or maybe it‚Äôs a case of saying, ‚ÄúWow, Duke Dooku is such an asshole. Even though he‚Äôs my NPC, I will probably be dreaming about throttling him in my sleep. I hope he gets his just desserts in the end!‚Äù Share. Don‚Äôt be quiet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen to your players even when you might not be supposed to, and take as much of their input as possible into the game. When they shout out suggestions, say, ‚ÄúYes! That‚Äôs exactly what happens!‚Äù more often than not. Your games will be better for it and your players will be more involved and more invested. (But also know your games well enough to know the moments where you <em>shouldn‚Äôt</em> do so! Know the places and times where that would undercut the creative goals of your game.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When prepping for a game, try to limit yourself to material that‚Äôs already been introduced by the players. For instance, if you need a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù, look through the character sheets first, and see if any character has a hated enemy or a nemesis or a father figure who died during the Clone Wars, and bring that in, rather than making something up whole cloth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of my best game experiences have come from making a rule for myself not to introduce or prep <em>anything</em> that doesn‚Äôt come from or flow directly from something on a character sheet or that a player has said. It makes GMing feel so easy, and leads to such consistent quality!</p>
