    <title>Getting Into Gauntlet Calendar Games</title>

    <description>This is an evergreen question, so I want to answer and pin this response. Anyone can sign up for sessions on the Gauntlet Calendar. GMs post from one week out to two months out. For most sessions, there&#39;s a 48 hour window for Patreon supporters to sign up. After that anyone can. Some sessions, aimed exclusively at new players waive this period. 

But sessions can often fill fast, so what can you do?
1. Sign up for the waitlist. The  **majority**  of our games draw from wait lists as folks schedules changes. Every month we have players join from there, sometimes several persons deep.
2. Keep an eye out for games aimed at new players. Some GMs will hold the first several days of their games for new members or players who they haven’t run for yet. They’ll announce that in the listing. It will often be in the title of the game posted here. 
3. Make a post in the Gauntlet Community channel-- stating that you&#39;re looking to get into a session on the Calendar. This is especially useful if you have some time restrictions: only certain days and times you have free. Mention if you&#39;re looking for particular games. Event Creators often keep an eye out for these threads. They might set up a session and reserve a seat for a new player. 
4. Be flexible and willing to try games you might not otherwise.
