    <description>*They speak in our stories, those sparkling stories,*
*Of a land so very far away,*
*Where their ain’t no tyrants, ain’t no evil things,*
*Ain’t no Admen, ain’t no kings.*
*But it’s hard to imagine those grasslands greener,*
*When I toil so long on the rust.*
*For the big folks seem to always get meaner,*
*While the small folks turn to dust.*

*Yet still I’m dreaming, always dreaming,*
*Of that land where the water tastes like wine,*
*Where our city sits, always gleaming,*
*Oh Lord Almighty, tell me one day I’ll be fine,*
*For though my fire burns low*
*And my story’s nearly told,*
*Still I’m marching, always marching,*
*To The West.*

*They say across the ocean, that Peaceful Ocean,*
*Of that sea on fire with the sun,*
*There’s a better place there, that’s my notion,*
*Where they’ll never make us run.*
*But it’s hard to see through all of the dust they blew,*
*To keep our heads so bowed and low,*
*It’s hard to hold onto what we all know is true,*
*To remember what we’re owed.*

*Yet still I’m dreaming, always dreaming,*
*Of that land where the water tastes like wine,*
*Where our city sits, always gleaming,*
*Oh Lord Almighty, tell me one day I’ll be fine,*
*For though my fire burns low*
*And my story’s nearly told,*
*Still I’m marching, always marching,*
*To The West.*

*Well my sun dips low, and my eyes are closing,*
*As I breathe in ragged gasps,*
*And I don’t know what waits, but I’m supposing,*
*That these’ll be my last.*
*But God as my witness, I’ll go out swinging,*
*For I was never made to bow,*
*And God as my witness, I’ll never stop singing,*
*And I’ll meet my Maker tall and proud.*

*‘Cuz still I’m dreaming, always dreaming,*
*Of that land where the water tastes like wine,*
*Where our city sits, always gleaming,*
*Oh Lord Almighty, tell me one day I’ll be fine,*
*For though my fire burns low*
*And my story’s nearly told,*
*Still I’m marching, always marching,*
*To The West.*

*For though my fire burns low*
*And my story&#39;s nearly told,*
*Still I’m marching, always marching,*
*To The West.*

*Still I’m marching…*
*Always marching…*

*To The West.*

This session is scheduled for 3 hours. It will be recorded with the consent of all participants.

This is the second playtest of a prototype I&#39;m working on called To The West. It&#39;s a 4-part series. This series will be unrelated to the 2-part series in July, and folks from that are free to join this one, as well. Being able to attend each session is preferred, but not required. You must RSVP for each session you wish to attend.

To The West is about ordinary folks from the United States who have died and came back as Wanderers, individuals caught between the physical reality of the country and its confused, complex psyche. They&#39;re wandering across a United States alive with its histories, myths, and demons in search of passage to a mythical land called the West where they might find a good life. The game&#39;s about folks struggling against powers too large for them to overcome, about contending with the troubled past of the nation, and about finding hope for a better life in bleak times.

We&#39;ll be using the X-Card and Lines and Veils for safety, and the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy will be in full effect.

CONTENT WARNING: American history, pulled from often and directly, in all its horrible, messy beauty, though any elements of it can be Lined at the request of the players.
