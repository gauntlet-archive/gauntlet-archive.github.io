    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/04/18/crowdfunding-collection-165/&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #165, including every tabletop rpg project started between 04/11 and 04/18&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Let’s start with having a look at &lt;b&gt;Orbital Blues&lt;/b&gt;. A roleplaying game, in which you play Space Cowboys, similar as in Cowboy Bebop. Which is one of the inspirations next to Guardians of the Galaxy and Firefly. The narrative, rules-lite system is d6 based, with about five important core stats. Next to that the game comes with a casette, and thus a soundtrack, which is available via Spotify (for free) too. I think it’s a very cool, and I am tempted to back it. If you are intothe Symbaroum setting, yet would like to play it with D&amp;D 5E style rules, the &lt;b&gt;Ruins of Symbaroum&lt;/b&gt; project from Free League has you covered. A more than solid project from an experienced project from my point of view. &lt;b&gt;Jamie Noble´s Masquerade&lt;/b&gt; is more of an immersive theatre, rather larp-y, experience, with a card based system. In the end, I decided it looks roleplayingly and solid enough to warrant an inclusion. The last game to mention is &lt;b&gt;HAWTHORN&lt;/b&gt;, an horror RPG. It offers detective-style horror inspired by cthulhoid horrors. You can checkout the quickstarter at DTRPG.
Among the other projects, you’ll find the &lt;b&gt;Comets &amp; Cockpits&lt;/b&gt; setting for D&amp;D 5E. &lt;b&gt;Fantasy City Sites and Scenes III&lt;/b&gt; offers stuff to create locations for your random fantasy game, while the &lt;b&gt;Tavern Tales&lt;/b&gt; offers, well, taverns, for D&amp;D 5E. In regards of the dice, I like the &lt;b&gt;Purryhedrals&lt;/b&gt;, transparent dice with little dice figurines in them.
You’ll find these, and other projects, over here:
