          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2021/04/18/crowdfunding-collection-165/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #165, including every tabletop rpg project started between 04/11 and 04/18</b></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with having a look at <b>Orbital Blues</b>. A roleplaying game, in which you play Space Cowboys, similar as in Cowboy Bebop. Which is one of the inspirations next to Guardians of the Galaxy and Firefly. The narrative, rules-lite system is d6 based, with about five important core stats. Next to that the game comes with a casette, and thus a soundtrack, which is available via Spotify (for free) too. I think it’s a very cool, and I am tempted to back it. If you are intothe Symbaroum setting, yet would like to play it with D&amp;D 5E style rules, the <b>Ruins of Symbaroum</b> project from Free League has you covered. A more than solid project from an experienced project from my point of view. <b>Jamie Noble´s Masquerade</b> is more of an immersive theatre, rather larp-y, experience, with a card based system. In the end, I decided it looks roleplayingly and solid enough to warrant an inclusion. The last game to mention is <b>HAWTHORN</b>, an horror RPG. It offers detective-style horror inspired by cthulhoid horrors. You can checkout the quickstarter at DTRPG.<br>
Among the other projects, you’ll find the <b>Comets &amp; Cockpits</b> setting for D&amp;D 5E. <b>Fantasy City Sites and Scenes III</b> offers stuff to create locations for your random fantasy game, while the <b>Tavern Tales</b> offers, well, taverns, for D&amp;D 5E. In regards of the dice, I like the <b>Purryhedrals</b>, transparent dice with little dice figurines in them.<br>
You’ll find these, and other projects, over here:</p>
