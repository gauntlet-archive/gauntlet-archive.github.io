This is playtest of my forthcoming game *Last Fleet* . I need all players to attend every session, please. You must RSVP to all four sessions.

I would like to record the sessions if I can figure out the technology in time.

*Last Fleet*  is a PBTA game where you play brave pilots, officers, engineers and politicians on board a rag-tag fleet of ships, fleeing across space from an implacable, inhuman adversary. The game&#39;s central theme is around pressure: pressure on individuals, pressure on the fleet. The mechanics reinforce this through gradual build-up of Pressure, which can lead to characters hitting Breaking Point, meaning they do something risky or irrational.

Gameplay has three significant elements: intrigue, action and FEELS. Intrigue is around holding the fractured peoples of the fleet together and hunting for traitors and sleeper agents. Action is mostly around space battles and suchlike. FEELS is how you tackle your Pressure. Build relationships or let loose with hedonism - either way you&#39;ll introduce complications and emotional ties that make the intrigue and action all the juicier.

If you want to talk to me about the game, either hit me up on here, or email me at lastfleet (at) vapourspace (dot) net. Don&#39;t leave comments on the event postings as it may take me a long time to notice them!

I&#39;ll be using the X Card, and happy to pick up any other safety tools if the group are keen. Please see the [Gauntlet inclusivity policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) for more details.
