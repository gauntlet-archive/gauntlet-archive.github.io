    <title>Game design with 4-up printing</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/game-design-with-4-up-printing/5536</link>
    <description>Seeking terminology advice. I’m building a Pokèmon-like game that is highly reliant on 4-up printing, but realize that not everyone knows how to do this, or even what it is. What comes to your mind when you see the phrase “4-up printing”?

(To spare the suspense, 4-up printing is when you print four pages of a document on a single piece of paper. Did you know that? Do you call it something else? Do you know how to do this with a PDF?)

I’m assuming I’m going to need to explain how to do this in the game book, with examples, but I’d love to be wrong.</description>

<p>That’s the plan. Going to be an uphill battle, it appears. The people who don’t love the printing instructions are <em>really</em> going to not love the python script alternative. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<p>The game is really niche anyway. Good thing it will be free!</p>

              <p>I’ve been working in a printshop the last couple of years, so I know how to print 4-up, but as a non-native speaker of english, the actual jargon wouldn’t have worked for me.</p>
<p>Also, looking at the people I’ve met at work … you totally can design a game that needs to be printed a certain way, but you will limit your possible audience by doing it and risks frustrating potential players.</p>
<p>This could be alleviated by explaining it instead in a bit more detail, providing links to <a href="https://pdfresizer.com/multipage" rel="nofollow noopener">online tools</a> if you can find any that are easy to use or provide alternatives where possible. (Printing and cutting up, maybe? Digital character sheets for people without printers?)</p>
<p>But, ultimately, printing is messy and hard for a lot of people.</p>

<p>I would have called it “4 page booklet”.  And provided files which flip on the long and short edge, so those who have a duplex printer, but don’t know how to change that setting still can print the game.</p>
