&gt; *In the mists of ancient time, a poet sings of great deeds wrought by mighty heroes—of monsters slain and justice restored, of wise counsel and devious strategies, of courage, valor, and daring—defiant of the gods themselves. In Agon, you create these heroes, crafting their epic tale into an immortal legend.*
&gt;
&gt; *On their way back home from war, a band of heroes become lost among strange islands populated by mythical creatures, dangerous villains, legendary kingdoms, and desperate people—each entangled in strife, at the mercy of the capricious gods.*
&gt;
&gt; *It falls to you as the epic heroes of your age to seize this opportunity for greatness—to set things right in these lost lands, overcome the trials of gods, monsters, and mortals, prove the glory of your name, and win your way back home.*
