    <description>My question is pretty self explanatory. I&#39;m about to start playing in a PbP game of The Sword, The Crown and The Unspeakable Power but we&#39;re not sure how to handle the moves that are built around specific sessions which start and end. Does anyone have any alternatives to recommend?</description>

              <p>When I do these games online (say on Tavern-Keeper) - I generally go by “significant pause/change of scene” which is a fairly subjective call.</p>

              <p>You could handle sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on some written unit of play - number of scenes, number of posts, number of posts per user, or word count.</li>
<li>Based on some game unit of play - perhaps a number of rolls made.</li>
<li>Based on some recurring event in the mechanics or fiction - every time a PC dies, every time someone scores an advance, every time the volcano on the island erupts, after each meeting of the Water Cult…</li>
<li>Based on a real-world calendar - every Sunday, we start a new session</li>
<li>Based on an in-world calendar - each “day” in the game is a “session”</li>
<li>Based on dramatic needs and pacing: basically, each “session” is like an episode of a TV show or a chapter in a book, and at some point in the action, someone declares a “new session”. When it feels right, you declare the end of one chapter and that we are starting a new one. Maybe you fast-forward a little bit, maybe not; but it marks a break in the story.</li>
</ul>
