    <description>AGON: Release the Kraken!

**New Blood Initiative - For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you have not yet had a chance to play AGON**

*In the mists of ancient time, a poet sings of great deeds wrought by mighty heroes—of monsters slain and justice restored, of wise counsel and devious strategies, of courage, valor, and daring—defiant of the gods themselves. In Agon, you create these heroes, crafting their epic tale into an immortal legend.*

*On their way back home from war, a band of heroes become lost among strange islands populated by mythical creatures, dangerous villains, legendary kingdoms, and desperate people— each entangled in strife, at the mercy of the capricious gods.*

*It falls to you as the epic heroes of your age to seize this opportunity for greatness—to set things right in these lost lands, overcome the trials of gods, monsters, and mortals, prove the glory of your name, and win your way back home.*

*Okay, there’s (probably) no Kraken. But this July run will definitely be more *Clash of the Titans* and less Homer.

There will be 3 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Each session is 3 hours.

**NUMBER OF PLAYERS** : Three players in addition to the GM.

**SAFETY TOOLS IN USE** : X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy, Stars &amp; Wishes. The game will follow [the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

**VENUE/TECH** : Zoom Video, Roll20 for character sheets, etc. Expect an email one week before the first session with the Roll20 link, and another an hour or so before each session.

**BREAKS** : Two 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

**RECORDING** : Session will be recorded, but would only be posted with full player consent. Currently the plan is to record only for the GM’s reference.

**PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED** : None – rules will be taught in play.

*Also, this catchphrase would like to distance itself from voter fraud conspiracy theories, so don’t even. :)
