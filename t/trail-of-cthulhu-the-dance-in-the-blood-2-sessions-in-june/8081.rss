    <title>Trail of Cthulhu: The Dance In The Blood (2 sessions in June)</title>

    <description>***I&#39;m saving one space for someone who hasn&#39;t played in a game I&#39;ve run on the Gauntlet Calendar before. If that&#39;s you, please DM me to claim the spot.***

The small town of Keswick sits in the grim countryside of the Lake District in the early 1930s. Whatever brought you here, you’ve found yourself in the bar of the Blackstone Hotel, an old, fading building that retains little of its former charm. The carpets are frayed, the furniture scuffed and a smell of mould permeates. You have a bad feeling about what you may find in this town, and your bad feeling is right. 

We&#39;ll be playing using Trenchcoat, a set of Trail of Cthulhu house rules by Cat Ramen that drift the game towards pbta and away from mental health mechanics. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. The Dance In The Blood is a Trail scenario by Graham Walmsley. 

The tone of this game will be bleak, fatalistic horror, and will best suit people willing to embrace a play-to-lose approach. Subject matter will include violence, body horror, harm to animals and possibly children. We’ll use safety tools including the X card, lines and veils and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

Attendance at both sessions is strongly encouraged. 

Sessions will be played over Zoom with short breaks on the hour. I’ll record and post the sessions only if all players enthusiastically consent. 

I’ll email players a week before the first session to confirm attendance, share play materials, etc.

Open access time for sign ups is 6:30pm 10 May AEST.
