<p>But assuming you had light dice from either skills or devil’s bargains, couldnt you always try that roll with just light dice first, then decide to add a dark die if you needed a re-roll?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep – that’s exactly right, and often how it works in play.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems like in this example, the GM calls for a Risk Roll with a mandatory dark die, which I didnt know was a thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GM can declare that the thing the treasure-hunter is doing is dangerous to their mind or body and so they should include the dark die. If the player wants to avoid including the dark die, they might need to try their action a different, less dangerous way. I always just say “Hey, what you’re doing seems dangerous. You should probably include a dark die on this roll.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or is it that the player, per the fiction, knows that they would need to include the dark die so they do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The player is always free to include the dark die on their own, if they think that what they’re doing is dangerous enough.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p>

              <p>Hello!  Late to the party, but I ran Trophy Dark a few weeks back and was nuts for it.</p>
<p>I’m planning on running Trophy Gold (Hester’s Mill) but we keeps tripping me up is dark dice on Risk Rolls.  The rules claim if you want to risk mind and/or body, you can add a dark die to the roll.  So far, so good.  But assuming you had light dice from either skills or devil’s bargains, couldnt you always try that roll with just light dice first, then decide to add a dark die if you needed a re-roll?  Would there be any mechanical advantage to adding the black die first, or is it just for the player to decide their character is doing it as part of the fiction?</p>
<p>Also, earlier in this thread Jesse Ross quoted an example:</p>
<p>Baso (Ruin 2) is exploring the room for secret passages. The GM calls for a Hunt Roll. Baso gets a 2 as their highest. Something bad happens: a trap is triggered and a volley of arrows are flying toward Baso! The GM calls for a Risk Roll to avoid them, <strong>but their body is at risk, so they need to include a dark die.</strong> Baso rolls a 5… on their dark die. Baso avoids the arrows, but their Ruin still goes up to 3 and there’s a complication. As the complication, the GM decides that in the dive to avoid getting hit, Baso twists their ankle and takes the Condition “Limping”.</p>
<p>It seems like in this example, the GM calls for a Risk Roll with a mandatory dark die, which I didnt know was a thing?  Or is it that the player, per the fiction, knows that they would need to include the dark die so they do?  I’m just a little confused.  Any insight or clarification would be super.</p>
<p>Everything else is dynamite.</p>

              <p>Is this still the place to ask questions about Trophy Gold? I just discovered it, by way of FoaBD, and while I’m really excited about the game, I have a LOT of questions and things I’m unclear on. I’ve listened to all of the relevant FoaBD episodes, and I’ve watched a couple of actual play videos, and I still have so many points of confusion. Should I post them here, or has the conversation moved elsewhere?</p>

              <p>Trophy feels very specific to me and I like it because of that. I don’t want it to be a catch-all system. So that’s why I want to think about how to deal with different settings.<br>
I don’t know 5e, I only played BECMI and AD&amp;D 2nd. But personally I think D&amp;D played outside its tropes is a bad idea unless it’s heavily hacked. It’s how I look at games, I like them to do specific things with its rules and settings. I think mixing the Trophy setting and PC Backgrounds with high fantasy (for example) would make no sense at all. Since the majority of OSR modules include classic elements of high fantasy I think that’s something to deal with.</p>
<p>It’s not a huge problem though, just something I’d like to talk and think about.<br>
If there are modules without orcs they are the exeption and it would not change much in my question. Or do you think we should just convert modules from non-classic fantasy settings?</p>

              <p>Oooh I seee, so these are like two different ways to play the game right? Or you stay in setting and maybe convert alot of stuff, or you simply use Trophy as a tool to play old modules with all the implied setting. Ok.<br>
Frankly I was hoping in something more then “it’s up to you” in the system (not in your answers). I still think it’s a fairly common situation and should be addressed directly if you take the time to build a conversion system “for classic OSR” to a game with a setting that is pretty different.</p>
<p>Btw it’s a long time that I don’t play old-school fantasy stuff (early 00s) but I’ve never seen a D&amp;D campaign without orcs. And I’ve never really been a fan of reskinning modules; I think it was a pain in the ass and ultimately not worth it (often) because every setting has its own mood and it’s not “satisfying” to import export that between games. But that’s me, and maybe in Trophy that works better, I’ll have to try.</p>
<p>I’ll think about it a bit more</p>

              <p>It’s up to you if you map the module you are converting to the Trophy setting, or just use Gold’s rules, but ditch the setting for one more appropriate for the module you are running. I think in general it’s not uncommon to re-skin a module to make it work with the game you’re currently playing. (If you have a long running D&amp;D campaign set in a world without orcs, what would you do? Trophy isn’t special here.)</p>
<p>The Kalduhr setting is currently some forum posts, and whatever is implicit in the rules themselves, and the existing incursions.</p>

              <p>First, that’s just because Trophy includes a built-in setting of Kalduhr. If your game is not set there, all that means is that you have a few minutes of writing to do. The game currently contemplates three other “backgrounds” that are not, strictly speaking, “human”: Unmasked Faeborn, Cured Beastbitten, and Orphaned Manikins. Mechanically, all you do is write a skill for each of them (and of course you could have more than one background per heritage, each with its own skill). The rest is just in the fiction, and that’s up to you!</p>

              <p>Hi guys, for some reason the Trophy marketing didn’t clicked with me initially so I skipped it completely. But I’m really happy to have backed yesterday after reading the Dark quickstart (and Gold partly) and I’m frankly so stoked about the rules, I can’t wait to get down with it at the table!</p>
<p>For now I just have a question about Gold: <strong>how is it supposed to work on module conversions from different settings?</strong> I understand it’s a more abstracted approach <em>for the structure part</em> of the module and I love it. But. More specifically for the setting, if Trophy have no classic Tolkien/D&amp;D creatures like Dwarves, Elves and Orcs, what am I supposed to do when they are part of a module? I presume I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>convert them to humans</li>
<li>leave them as they are and just exclude them as “people of the crown”</li>
</ul>
<p>The first solution can be OK in some case, but probably less so in others. The latter solution seems a bit off to me.</p>
<p>What I think right now is to exclude Tolkien’s humanoid “good people” and just go with humans, and also not to use the Tolkien’s “bad people/mass foes” Orcs, Goblins-Hobgoblins which are all very specific to the Middle Earth setting. D&amp;D and other fantasy games versions are more varied but I consider them similar, particularly because they are all implying some sort of standard for the “size”, power-level and social organization of those creatures.</p>
<p>On page 15 of the Trophy Gold quickstarter when describing Medium monsters, I believe goblins, orcs, skeletons, dwarves, and elves are referred to the typical D&amp;D module version, right? But folklore orcs maybe would better fit a Large monster.</p>
<p>In Trophy I would be more inclined to use some sort of folklore versions of the same creatures, which are vastly varied in scope, specific powers and role.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about all this?</strong> (I hope it’s clear what I’m talking about…)</p>

<p>You study the spellbooks to learn the Rituals – narratively, you don’t need the spellbook and once a Ritual is learned it can’t be lost, even if it’s one you learned after character creation. The reason your Ruin doesn’t go up is purely mechanical, so that you can learn more Rituals without running out of Ruin, since there are only 6 Ruin slots to play with.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, I published last week a french adaptation of Trophy Gold, along with a Trophy Dark one. Since it’s on a pwyw basis, you can check both there, even if you’re just curious and don’t have any french skill: <a href="http://nicolasfolliot.itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">nicolasfolliot.itch.io</a><br>
… and since I finally started playing the TOSK incursion (yes, <em>after</em> publishing the game), here I am with a couple questions I hope you might all help me with.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Ruin and Rituals:</strong> Does the starting Ruin being at 1 goes with a mandatory pick of <em>at least</em> 1 Ritual? Or should you be allowed to pick no Ritual, which means a 1-Ritual character should actually start with 2 Ruin points?<br>
<strong>Rituals and Spellbooks:</strong> What happens to your learned Rituals if you eventually lose the book? Have you learned the Ritual enough to use it without it, and if so why hasn’t it raised your Ruin like starting Rituals?<br>
<strong>Weapons and Combat:</strong> “<em>Weapons allow you to participate in a Combat Roll</em>”, does this mean you can’t even get involved in a fight with your bare hands?</p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts!</p>

              <p>Congrats on running Gold for the first time, and extra congrats for doing on a livestream! You’re braver than me!</p>
<p>I’ll check out the recording and give you more specific feedback later on, but based on how you described what you did, you made the right call.</p>
<p>If they were looking for clues, that’s definitely a Hunt Roll. And following up a Hunt Roll with a Risk Roll or Combat Roll is also the right call in a lot of cases. Hunt Rolls shouldn’t directly affect Ruin, so if they’re about to do something dangerous, then call for one of those other two rolls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baso (Ruin 2) is exploring the room for secret passages. The GM calls for a Hunt Roll. Baso gets a 2 as their highest. Something bad happens: a trap is triggered and a volley of arrows are flying toward Baso! The GM calls for a Risk Roll to avoid them, but their body is at risk, so they need to include a dark die. Baso rolls a 5… on their dark die. Baso avoids the arrows, but their Ruin still goes up to 3 and there’s a complication. As the complication, the GM decides that in the dive to avoid getting hit, Baso twists their ankle and takes the Condition “Limping”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, a Hunt Roll failure leads directly to the Risk Roll. Had the trap been a wondering monster, then it could have lead to a Combat Roll instead if the players decided to engage with the monster, or a Risk Roll if they just wanted to get away.</p>
<p>Original Trophy is all about the Risk Roll, but in Trophy Gold, almost everything that happens  flows out of a Hunt Roll.</p>

              <p>I ran my first Trophy Gold game today (and livestreamed no less, which didn’t help the nerves). The group had a good time and particularly liked using the <a href="http://character.totalpartykill.ca/trophy/" rel="nofollow noopener">random character generation</a> by <a class="mention" href="/u/funkaoshi">@funkaoshi</a>. This really highlighted the idea that looking for those connections between otherwise random results can create interesting narratives in a way that feeds into collaboration!</p>
<p>However, I can’t shake the feeling that I was “doing it wrong”. (We had a good time, so I’m not getting down on myself - it wasn’t <em>wrong</em> wrong!) Specifically, I kept referring to the original TSK text instead of the example conversion in TG. I think this might have been part of why I had trouble with Hunt vs Risk rolls, because I used these mechanics at the same time I <em>also</em> used traditional OSR/D&amp;D techniques (in hindsight, anyway). Much like when I first started playing Dungeon World, it’s hard to run things without falling into old habits!</p>
<p>With that in mind: <strong>how do folks determine when to use which kind of roll?</strong> Specifically, let’s say a player is describing how they are interacting with a dangerous object or environmental element, looking for clues. On the one hand, it fits the criteria of “exploring your environment”. On the other hand, it definitely also qualifies as “attempting a risky task”. Sometimes I used a Hunt roll, with the idea that that (say) the poison gas inside the coffin or whatever would then generate a Risk roll if they got “something terrible happens”. Other times, I felt like they knew it was dangerous and I just had them make the Risk roll straight out.</p>
<p>Again, this was our first session, and we all went with the stated assumption that we are learning and figuring out the system. I will do some things differently next week, for sure, but I’d really appreciate any advice on this aspect.</p>

I think when I run town in the future  I’ll encourage the players to set  scenes when they spend gold or go rest at thier household by asking questions.</p>
<p>The beasitary has been ignored by the players. I brought up in our first session and they have not touched that mechanism since. Its there when they want to use it or engage with it but I am not going to force them to use it. It could be possible that online its harder for the players to use the beasitary because its a couple of spreadsheets tabs away.</p>
