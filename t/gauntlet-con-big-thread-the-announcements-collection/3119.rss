              <h3>Update on 10-02-2019</h3>
<p><strong>Getting Admission to the Con</strong></p>
<p>As of yesterday, you can get admission to Gauntlet Con 2019 via <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-con-2019-registration.html" rel="nofollow noopener">either Patreon or PayPal</a>. Also, if you’re a Patreon supporter and need me to confirm you as an attendee, be sure you <a href="https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">log in to the RSVP site first</a>, then leave a post on this <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/gauntlet-con-30290293" rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Into Games</strong></p>
<p>If you logged into the Gauntlet Con Events/RSVP site in the last 48 hours, you should be approved to sign up for events now!</p>
<p>Early registration start last weekend (Sept. 28), but we still have over 90 events with open spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse <a href="https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/calendar" rel="nofollow noopener">calendar</a> and <a href="https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/all-events-info" rel="nofollow noopener">full schedule</a>
</li>
<li>Check out this <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-con-games-with-openings/3464">forums thread of open games</a>
</li>
<li>Check out my <a href="https://twitter.com/Arr_Roo/status/1179167069092356098" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter thread yesterday</a> (even if you don’t use Twitter)</li>
</ul>
<p>Open games include games with guests and in-demand games such as Monsterhearts, Dungeon World, Hearts of Wulin, and OSR Adventures. Don’t despair - come check out the RSVP site and sign up!</p>
<p>If you’ve got questions about registration or games available, please reach out.</p>
<p><strong>Waitlists</strong></p>
<p>Each game also has a waitlist option. If you see a game you’re interested in but it doesn’t have openings, don’t hesitate to join the waitlist. For any event, we find that 50-75% of games have at least one attendee drop, sometimes more. The waitlist may get you into games you really want.</p>
<p><strong>Helpdesk</strong></p>
<p>If you’re returning to Gauntlet Con, you’ll know that we have a helpdesk that’s legendary. You can approach them for tech help, game recommendations, game mustering, panel/workshop access, issues you’re running into in-game, or anything else. We need help staffing that helpdesk this year, especially in non-US/Canadian timezones. If you’re willing to help out with helpdesk, get in touch and let me know.</p>

              <p>We’ve got just 1 week before Gauntlet Con registration opens on Saturday, Sept. 28 at 5 PM Eastern (NYC/Toronto Time). Here’s what you need to know to get ready!</p>
<p><strong>Be a Gauntlet Patreon Supporter!</strong></p>
<p>The first week or so of registration is for Gauntlet Patreon Supporters. You can back the Gauntlet Patreon at any level $2+ to get the start of registration, as long as you sign up by Sept. 23!</p>
<p><strong>Sign up for the Registration Site!</strong></p>
<p>Patreon supporters will then need to login to the con registration site: <a href="https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/</a>. This creates your registration site account, and we can’t confirm you as an attendee until  <em>AFTER</em>  you sign into the site.</p>
<p><strong>Get a Look at the Games!</strong></p>
<p>While you’re on the registration site, take a look at the games on offer. We’re planning for over 80 GMs running more than 170 games. As of this morning (9/21), there were already 150 games on the site.</p>
<p><strong>Get a Look at the Guests!</strong></p>
<p>We’ve got guest announcements each day. You can check them out on the con Website: <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-con-2019.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-con-2019.html</a> or at our forums (where we also link to the games each guest is running): <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-big-gauntlet-con-2019-guests-thread/3113" class="inline-onebox">The Big Gauntlet Con 2019 Guests Thread</a>.</p>

<p>Just a couple of announcements this week…</p>
<p><strong>Guests!</strong></p>
<p>We’re in the middle of our guest announcements process, and you can see the guests we’ve announced so far on our <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-con-2019.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Gauntlet Con site</a> or the guest thread on <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-big-gauntlet-con-2019-guests-thread/3113" rel="nofollow noopener">Gauntlet Forums</a>.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve announced: Diogo Nogueira, Sharang Biswas, Abigail LaLonde, Storybrewers (Hayley and Vee), Ben Laurence, GMDK (David, Fiona, Camilla, and Vivien), James Mendez Hodes, and Jahmal “Mad Jay” Brown. More coming between now and registration starting.</p>
<p><strong>See the Calendar</strong></p>
<p>Our event creators are still adding their games to the registration site, but you can check out the 117 games already on the calendar here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/calendar" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/calendar</a></p>
<p>While there, go ahead and sign into the site with your Google ID! This will speed up the registration process for everyone who’s a Patreon supporter.</p>
<p><strong>How to Register!</strong></p>
<p>Gauntlet Con 2019 registration begins at 5 PM Eastern/NYC/Toronto Time on Saturday, Sept. 28.</p>
<p>To be ready to register, you need to complete two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support <a href="http://patreon.com/gauntlet" rel="nofollow noopener">The Gauntlet on Patreon</a>  <em><strong>by</strong></em>  Sept. 23! People who back us after that point may not be able to register on Sept. 28.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Log into the registration site with a Google ID</a>. Even if you are a Patreon supporter, we  <em><strong>cannot</strong></em>  approve you as an attendee until after you log into the registration site at least once. Your logging in is the only way we have to create your account on the registration site.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know this can be a bit of a hassle, but this will ensure you can register when registration opens!</p>
