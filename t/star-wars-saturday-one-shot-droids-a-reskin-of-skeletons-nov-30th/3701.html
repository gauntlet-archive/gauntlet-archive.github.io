<h1><strong>Jabba’s Palace</strong></h1>
<h2>Shortly following his death…</h2>
<p>The death of Jabba on his sail barge leaves some questions. Most of his court died in a fiery explosion, but not everyone. What became of Jabba’s droids after his death? What became of his palace in the sands?</p>
<p>This game seeks to answer these questions using the framework of Jason Morningstar’s  <em>The Skeletons.</em>  Instead of skeletons defending an ancient tomb, you will play as droids, recently awoken from their scheduled memory wipes, to a palace they no longer recognize.</p>
<p>The fleeing bodyguards and slaves ransacked the palace, leaving behind traces of luxury and cruelty. The sands stretch far and wide. Jawas would certainly take any droid that leaves. A spark of independence and freedom from servitude exists here, but interlopers from outside seek to take the palace. The sands intrude.</p>
<p>Time, and The Force, echo in these empty halls.</p>
<p><em><strong>Awaken droids, and defend the palace!</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>THE SKELETONS</strong>  is meditative structured freeform game for 1-6 players. You’ll need a few hours and a private space.</p>
<hr>
<p>This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that’s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this session will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.We will be using the X-Card as well as Roses and Thorns after the session.This game session will be recorded.</p>
