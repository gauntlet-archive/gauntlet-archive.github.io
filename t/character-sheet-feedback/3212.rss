    <description>Hi ya&#39;ll! Second post on here so please be gentle :slightly_smiling_face:

I was pretty active a few months back on the Gauntlet but life got in the way and I&#39;m eager to get back into the groove. I&#39;ve also been working on my own game for the last couple years and it&#39;s finally ready to be play-tested which im **very** excited about. It&#39;s also going to be my first time GMing on the Gauntlet so I&#39;m a bit nervous too. 

Anyhow, I&#39;d love any feedback I can get on my current character sheet. The working title for the game right now is Archetype, btw. I had several design goals:

* I wanted to keep it to 1 standard sheet of paper, back and front.
* I wanted one side of it to be a source of roleplay inspiration (fluff) and the other to detail the mechanics (crunch). 
* I wanted good visual hierarchy and to keep it relatively uncluttered even with the space restriction.

You&#39;ll probably get a sense for some of the rules of my game merely by glancing at the character sheet, so I&#39;d love some feedback on that as well if you have any. 

And lastly, a shameless plug: if checking out the link gets your role-play juices flowing, I&#39;m running 4 sessions on Sundays in October with space and I&#39;d love it if you could help me make my dreams become real, literally. 

Thanks friends!

              <p>I’d say it’s coming together pretty well. You’ve got a lot to fit in there, so helping people find stuff quickly is key. I’d suggest</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to get rid of the rotated headings. I know it’s a great way to save space, but it is hard for people to read.</li>
<li>Be as clear as you can in terms of what are headings, what are stats, and what are supporting text. I don’t know what ‘SP Total’ is, but the layout suggests it’s the single most important thing on the sheet. Is that really the case in play?</li>

              <p>The equipment has “tags” which pretty much only keep track of item features, like at what range they’re useful as well as advantageous features (in green - might give bonus die in certain situations) and “flaws” (in red) which might be utilized by the GM when a player fails a roll. They’re pretty rules light and almost describe themselves.</p>
<p>As for the fonts, the game itself is totally setting agnostic; this just happens to be a cyber punk character but the game could play equally well in a fantasy or stone age setting so it’s hard to really do any font themes. I do agree with you, however, that the font choices aren’t my favorite. When I started designing the sheet there were only 10 or so fonts to choose from on Google Sheets and those were just the best of a list I wasn’t all too happy with.</p>

              <p>I don’t know what game it’s for, it seems like you need a lot of complex modifiers for things like equipment so the small font and a lack of space to show what those modifiers do mechanically (it might be elsewhere on the sheet?) are perhaps an issue - hard to do when keeping the sheet small with a complex system.</p>
<p>Second, I don’t know about the fonts - the sort of Diesel-punk, pulp or jet-age italic font doesn’t read very cyberpunk to me.  The small serif looks sort of typed dossier as well, so I would consider maybe finding some fonts that do a tiny bit of setting work for you?</p>
