    <title>(Playtesting Weekend) Defy the Gods</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/playtesting-weekend-defy-the-gods/7760</link>
    <description>*Defy the Gods* is a GM-less sword-and-sorcery game set in a pseudo-Mediterranean ancient world. Inspired by Conan, *Princess Mononoke* and Ray Harryhausen movies, with a queer perspective. Play a swordfighter, a ship captain, a scholar of Atlantean sorcery, and other classic characters from sword &amp; sorcery tales. Also play as the gods, the city, the wilds, and other forces that destabilize the world.

This is a game in early development. It may not go as planned, but we&#39;ll have fun regardless. We&#39;ll do some world-building and character creation, and then hopefully have a little time for play as well.

Characters explore who they are and who they want to become, balancing human connection, immortal glory, and mortal doom. Play may involve exploration, combat or sorcery.

We&#39;ll play over Zoom, for about three hours, with short breaks on the hour. If everyone&#39;s okay with it, I&#39;ll record the session for my own reference.

I’ll send out an email the week before the session to confirm attendance and share the character keeper.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play, and safety tools such as Lines &amp; Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.
