    <description>Forgive the gushing, but I am pleased that a networking gambit paid off.

Today being Free RPG Day, I was running some Cthulhu Dark in North London, largely so I could start up a good dialogue with the rpg buyer.

Suffice to say, Leisure Games in Finchley now stocks [**EXUVIAE**](gum.co/exuviae) and I&#39;m very pleased to soon be shelved alongside **The Clay that Woke**, **Dream Apart / Dream Askew**, and **Durance**.</description>
