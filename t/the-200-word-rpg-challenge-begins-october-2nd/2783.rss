    <title>The 200 Word RPG Challenge Begins October 2nd</title>

    <description>Hello everyone! 

This year&#39;s schedule has been posted, as well as our panel of excellent judges! 

https://200wordrpg.github.io/

This small tabletop game design challenge encourages **everyone** to make a complete role-playing game. It’s hard to work on a game, and much harder to finish one. This is an opportunity for participants to brainstorm, write, edit, playtest, and polish a game idea from start to finish.

I hope you&#39;ll be able to participate this year, get some feedback on your entries, and maybe even win some cool prizes!

Let me know if you have any questions.</description>
