    <description>When the weather in the U.S. became too harsh to live outside, corporations built high-tech biodomes so people could survive. Anyone unwilling or unable to work for them and live by their laws was stuck in urban slums full of pollutants, fake food, solar burn, and gangs. It’s here where we live, a group of rebels who refuse to cave to the cultural suicide that is corporate life. Among the people who are just trying to survive in this consumerist dictatorship is a resistance of competent cyborgs and hackers who oppose corporate life. Here in these neon city streets, you gotta talk fast to make friends, and you need to prove your cred to be trusted.

Dialect is a GM-less game about an isolated community, their language, and what it means for that language to be lost. In this game, you’ll tell the story of the Isolation by building their language. New words will come from the fundamental aspects of the community: who they are, what they believe in, and how they respond to a changing world.

I hope we can finish the session in around 3 hours, but not having played before, the extra hours is available if necessary. We will be using Streamyard &amp; playingcards.io, and the session will be recorded with the agreement of all participants. The game will go ahead with 2 or more signups.

We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.</description>
