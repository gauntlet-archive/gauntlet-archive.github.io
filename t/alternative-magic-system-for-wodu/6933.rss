    <title>Alternative Magic System for WoDu</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/alternative-magic-system-for-wodu/6933</link>
    <description>I am trying to create a magic system to use in my [World of Dungeons](http://www.onesevendesign.com/dw/world_of_dungeons_1979.pdf) games that is: 
  - simple 
  - has a `Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell` vibe
  - _levelless_
  - favors creativity/roleplay over math


# Magic

## Types
&gt; magi can cast spells in the following ways...

  1. Learned: +int - cast a number of known spells (equal to your level) or from texts (eg. scrolls, books)   
  2. Arcane: +wis - cast _experimental_ spells spontaneously by _intuition/feel_ at disadvantage (until you cast it successfully in combat)  
  3. Ritual: (requires `Ritual`) - 1+ hours time to cast; various components; more powerful spells take longer
  4. Bargain: +cha (requires `Summon`) - you employ the services of a demon, fae etc... _be careful!_
  5. Cantrips: (requires `Cantrip`) - parlor tricks can be _powerfully effective!_

## Mechanics
&gt; magic takes effort and stamina (con) and thus can be _painful_ if overused

  - 2d6+int/wis/cha
  - cast spells up to your number of hd+con
  - after casting hd+con number of spells, you take 1d6 damage for each spell cast (regardless of outcome)
  - spell damage is 2d6+level
  - spell damage increases +1d6 at 5th and 10th levels
  - spells are restored after resting in comfort and safety


  _Thoughts are most welcome..._</description>

              <p>First, I suggest checking out <em>Whitehack</em> for a great HP-driven free form magic system. Do yourself a favor and buy the book - I cannot recommend it enough.</p>
<p>Next, I’d suggest looking at <em>Freebooters on the Frontier</em>. While I like the idea of point-buy spellcasting, it was too fiddly at the table.</p>
<p>Lastly, here’s the system I’ve settled on, borrowing random spell tables from FotF and Maz Rats. These spells are all utility; direct damage requires Evocation.</p>
<p>Note that I use Mage as the singular spellcasting class; Cleric has morphed into more of a Priest/Paladin.</p>
<p><code>MAGE: You possess the spellbook of [MASTER]. No class skills. Special Abilities: * FAMILIAR: you always have a minor animal or monster assistant * SORCERY: Roll on the Spellbook table, once per HD. When you cast a spell that has been memorized from your spellbook, describe the intended scope and effects according to the spell name * SUMMONING: Your spellbook contains the rituals necessary to summon spirits, one per HD. Each spirit has a name, skill, want, attributes and HP equal to yours, and do 2d6dmg. When you command a summoned spirit, they will do what your tell them unless it is contrary to their want * EVOCATION: When you unleash arcane projectiles with unerring accuracy, inflict a total of 1d6 damage daily per HD.</code></p>

<p>Ahhh… good call.</p>
<p>So, some of my players just immediately fight the quicksilver/mage-in-a-bottle vibe of WoDu. Fair… so the goal is to give WoDu some options.</p>
<ol>
<li>learned magic should be a straight-up replication of a <em>more OSR</em> 5e? Maybe?</li>
<li>arcane is a throw towards Jonathan Strange; I want to offer the ability to: if not straight up <em>create</em> spells, then maybe to always be <em>enhancing them</em>? Also, any new spells in my game likely get added to the list <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
<li>Ritual is <em>essentually</em> WoDu <code>Ritual</code>
</li>
<li>Bargain == WoDu’s RAW magic system</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m liking the idea that:</p>
<ol>
<li>different magics logically take different attributes: thus it’s really hard to min/max</li>
<li>it’s <em>mostly</em> easy/intuative?</li>
<li>it uses existing mechanices</li>
<li>magic is hard; dangerous; damaging?</li>
</ol>
<p>Magic is hard work and takes a toll on the caster. In my game, you probably don’t want to go with the <em>feeble old wizard</em> trope <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Using HD basically for <em>spell slots</em> seems logical… but if they want to cast more, they’ll take damage.</p>

<p>Not <em>effectiveness</em> but having some constraints to the amount of spells you can cast. You can attempt to case &gt; hd+con but <em>it’s gonna literally hurt</em>.</p>
