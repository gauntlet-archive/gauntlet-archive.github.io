          <p>Two spots are currently reserved in this game, for a total of four PCs.</p>
<p><em>In a fantastic version of ancient China, the boundaries between the Six Realms have begun to collapse, bringing forth plagues of undead, powerful witches and sorcerers, and shapeshifting demons bloodthirsty for revenge on the mortal realm. The gods in the celestial realms are distant and aloof–the only remaining signs of their influence an isolated collection of shrines, relics, and magical weapons passed down by immortals who have long since disappeared. It falls to you to quiet the restless spirits, to soothe the ghosts of the past, and to bring honor to yourself and your clan. Steel now your heart and soul, wulin–for dark days still lie ahead.</em></p>
<p>This is a quarterly run of 13 sessions of Hearts of Wulin on Friday evenings (US time zones) in April through June. Rules will be taught and all are welcome to join irrespective of prior experience with the game. This game will be played using the Open Table policy and is likely to contain multiple story arcs, so there is no need to commit to the full run - though you are welcome and encouraged to do so if you enjoy the game. Sessions will be three hours in length and we will play using Zoom. I would prefer to record and release the game on YouTube with the consent of all participants, though players will not be barred from participating if they prefer for the game not to be posted.</p>
<p>We will be using the Fantastic Wuxia playbooks, moves, and mechanics to tell a wuxia story with elements of high fantasy and supernatural horror, emphasizing Chinese folklore and mythology. Touchstones include epic wuxia films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, supernatural romances and horror films such as Bride with White Hair and A Chinese Ghost Story, and high-powered xianxia media such as Thunderbolt Fantasy. Players may take on roles of not only highly-trained martial artists, but also sorcerers, exorcists, cursed outsiders, and monsters in human form. Most characters will also be members of powerful wulin clans, ranging from the upright orthodox sects to the villainous unorthodox cults. We will establish the factions and places of our world during character creation in the first game session.</p>
<p>The core rulebook describes Hearts of Wulin thusly: <em>In HEARTS OF WULIN, the player characters play potent heroes in a fantastic version of ancient China. PCs can do amazing things: fight expertly, balance on roof peaks, run along walls. But for all that skill and competence, the characters are undercut by their own hearts. Unrequited love, conflicting filial duty, loyalty to sworn friends—all these pull the characters in different directions.</em></p>
<p>Content Warning: Due to the supernatural elements featured in this game, this run will rely on horror and occult themes moreso than in standard martial art media. Romance (between PCs and/or NPCs) is also a recurring theme of the game, but we will avoid any graphic sexual content. Please note that while this is fundamentally a game of fantasy and imagination, it is inspired by Chinese culture and sensitivity to this is required, including some elements of Chinese religion and mythology. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct</a> and safety tools will be in use to ensure the comfort of all players. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.</p>
<p>Hearts of Wulin is designed by Lowell Francis, with additional development by Agatha Cheng, Rae Nedjadi, Alun Rees, and Sherri Stewart.</p>
