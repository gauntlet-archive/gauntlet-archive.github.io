*Life in the Commonwealth of the little folk is full of worries. You wrote your elderly aunt in a neighboring village a week ago and haven’t yet received a reply. A particularly large dire-badger has been digging into your half-cousins hole and escaping. A traveling conjurer named Lathspell shows up claiming to sell genuine magical artifacts. We need to address these problems, and quickly, before more severe perils start troubling our peaceful village.*

*Let&#39;s meet at The Singing Fool Tavern to discuss it.*
