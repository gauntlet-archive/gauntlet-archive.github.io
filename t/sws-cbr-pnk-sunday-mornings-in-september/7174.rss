In September, we&#39;ll return to high-tech Carannia, the capital city of Serenno. Carannia stretches as far as the eye can see, from the toxic coast to the city limits where the walls keep the wasteland from encroaching. Despite plentiful and abundant Imperial technology, most people continue to live as cogs in the machine of Zsinj&#39;s Empire, distracted from their ineffectual lives by slick consumerism and invasive media.

**CBR+PNK**  is a tabletop RPG for the cyberpunk genre. Player characters are a team of  **RUNNERS**  — mercs, criminals, activists living on the edge and running in the shadows of a gritty, ultraviolent world.

In these two sessions, you&#39;ll play a cast of characters making their  **LAST RUN** .

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

**CW: Violence, Imperial power abuse, violence. Strong emotional ties.**
**System**  :  *Forged in the Dark*
**Duration**  : Two 3-hour sessions
**Breaks**  : 1 mid-point break per session (10 mins)
**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom
**Recording**  : Yes, but made public only if consent by all the players
**Attendance**  : Joining both sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 
**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
