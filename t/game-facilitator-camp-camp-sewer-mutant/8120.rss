***PLEASE NOTE: an RSVP to this session constitutes an RSVP to the other three sessions running as part of Game Facilitator Camp Froghemoth in the same timeslot the following three weeks: July 8th, July 15th, and July 22nd at 8pm EST.*** ***If you will not be able to attend all 4 sessions it would be best to wait and attend a Game Facilitator Camp when your schedule is more open.***

Hi there! I’m Alexi Sargeant, and I facilitate games on the Gauntlet Calendar.  *And I want you to, too!*  In July I will be coaching four sessions of Game Facilitator Camp: one part support group, one part crash course on facilitating TTRPGs online.

During GFC I will be offering to help out new GMs run their first one-shot of a game of their choosing for the Gauntlet Calendar.

In this initial session I will walk you through the steps of starting a video call, creating events on Firebase, and sharing your events through the official channels. I will demonstrate how to use resources like [rollwithme.xyz](https://rollwithme.xyz/) and the [Play Aids folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11kvNX8LzFPLODGgnbXXGTOJ0bieDCfeF). We will go over the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and safety tools.

In the next three weeks, each participant will facilitate a one-shot session. I will attend each of these games myself, along with your fellow campers. Each one-shot will take place on the same day of the week and time as this event. First come, first served for reserving days for one-shots. When choosing what to run for your first session, pick a game that you feel comfortable with, that you find personally exciting, and that can support a number of players equal to the other participants and coach (that&#39;d be two other participants and one coach). It can even be a GM-less game! I will work with you to make sure you have everything you need to facilitate the game online.

I look forward to learning and playing together this July!
