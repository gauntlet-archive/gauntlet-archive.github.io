Project: Perseus is a game about superspies and their handlers fighting in the shadows against supernatural conspiracies and rival agencies during the late &#39;80s and early &#39;90s.  We play to find out if the Agents can outwit, outrun, or outfight their opponents while finding a balance of trust with their Operators—which may not be easy, as some Agents may not have the same objectives and agendas on the mission. This is a game inspired by superspy movies like James Bond or Atomic Blonde, classic government agency shows like Alias, Ghost in the Shell, or Witch Hunter Robin, and urban fantasy novels.

**Please note: This is a game with asymmetric player roles. One of the players will be an Operator, while the rest will play as Agents.**

**CW: supernatural horror, romance, possible betrayal, violence.**

**System** : [Project Perseus](https://www.evilhat.com/home/project-perseus/) (open playtest), rules will be taught in play.

**Duration** : A single three-hour session.

**Breaks** : 2 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

**Venue/Tech** : GM’s Zoom and Jon Grim’s Roll with Me. https://rollwithme.xyz

**Recording** : Yes, but only if all players consent to recording and publishing. (GM recording for reference).

**Attendance** : It’s a one-shot!

**Safety** : Lines &amp; Veils, The X-Card, Open Door Policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

**Open access** : Public signs up are available 3/25/2021 15:22 US CDT.

This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gauntlet-rpg.com%2Fcommunity-code-of-conduct.html&amp;v=3).
