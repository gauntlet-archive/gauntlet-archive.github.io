    <description>All access time for this session is [date=2021-03-04 time=12:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;]

*The Soul Sword Forge has lain abandoned since the death of the powerful sorcerer who created it. Since then, armies have fought, died, and scattered trying to claim Castle Rex for their own. Now you, a group of brave adventurers, have decided that you have what it takes to reclaim the forge. Will the castle let you escape with your lives, or will your own ambitions and desires be your undoing?*

This is an experimental run of The Soul Sword Forge, a Trophy Gold and OSE module, using the Thirsty Sword Lesbians ruleset. Thirsty Sword Lesbians is a game of daring action, fantastical adventure, and hot-blooded lesbians fighting against toxic powers. This series will have a slightly darker tone, and focus more on the fight against toxic powers than other TSL series might.

This is a 4 session series. I fully expect drop-in, drop-out play, so please sign up for as many sessions as you are able.

No knowledge of the rules or pregenerated characters are necessary, everything will be taught during the session.

We will be using Zoom and an online dice roller to play. The series will be recorded and shared with player permission. I will send out an e-mail 1 week in advance with all of this information again to remind folks.

## Content Warnings and Safety Tools

This module is fairly dark, and we may interact with the following topics. We can use Lines and Veils to mitigate these as appropriate, but by default these themes will be in play:

* Overambition
* Imprisonment and abandonment
* Graphic descriptions of injury or violence
* Desperation, obsession and poverty

In addition to using Lines and Veils, we will be using Script Change, the X card, and the Open Door Policy. All of these will be explained at the beginning of the series as needed. This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)
