    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Blood 3! This one is called “Three Dozen MORE Cult Horror Movies.” It&#39;s a blood-curdling sequel to the original &quot;Three Dozen Cult Horror Movies&quot; miscellany in Codex - Blood 2. 

Submissions should be no more than a short paragraph. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please avoid anything that seems like misogyny or sexual predation—we won&#39;t publish stuff like that. 

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

For example, please see the original &quot;Three Dozen Cult Horror Movies,&quot; linked below. Feel free to riff off those, make sequels for some of them, whatever. Importantly, please follow the format: &quot;Name of Movie (Year). Summary: Text. Best Kill: Text.&quot; Don&#39;t forget to include a &quot;Best Kill&quot; after your Summary.

Acting is horrible and some deaths seem stolen from other famous films such as Sew or Brunch.

              <p>I thought I was being original with <em>Wiener Schatten.</em></p>
<p>My goal was: 1) Horror movie from the Golden Age of Film; 2) European rather than American; 3) Serious rather than comic/campy.</p>
<p>Thinking about a serious film led me to think of one with a political message… in a pre-WWII Europe that was witnessing the rise of fascism. I then thought it would be cool for the film to be critical of the rise of fascism, which led me to think about portraying fascism as an infectious contagion.</p>
<p>And since zombies weren’t a thing in the '30s, that led me to vampires.</p>

              <p>THE FLICKER (2015) - Featuring silent movie era black and white sequences featuring gruesome murders with the violence itself happening off screen intercut with a 1990’s era suburban pressure cooker of infidelity, drug abuse, and financial peril covered by a thin veneer of success and idyllic marital bliss, The Flicker is a slow burn where tension builds as multiple untenable situations move towards inevitable confrontations only to have the third act explode into a gorefest as the killer from the black and white sequences goes from being a symbolic representation of resentment, regret, and fear to a very real supernatural killer, still rendered in flickering black and white even as the rest of the setting remains drearily naturalistic. Best kill: When failing life insurance salesman Bobby Cormack charges the nameless killer with a pocket knife after losing his wife, his job, his home, and his car in quick succession only to dissolve into a cloud of blood, organs, and bones, the slow motion explosion lovingly rendered from multiple angles in a sudden switch to split screen, a particularly surreal moment in a surreal film.</p>

              <p>WIDOWMAKER (1976) - Critics consider this entry the oddest, but most compelling, of the short-lived bicentennial American folk horror trend. It’s the story of Pecos Bill’s horse, set during the years preceding its actual team-up with Bill. The film (shot from a horse’s POV) featured avant-garde spectacles such as: 1st-person galloping scenes (with some risk of motion sickness), dream sequences about dancing apples and sugar cubes, and several incidents of cruel hoof-murder. BEST KILL: With a twister approaching, a desperado ropes Widowmaker only to be kicked into the air where their lasso slithers around their neck and also catches a spinning weathercock, which swings them in great gasping circles above the town, their lasso transformed into a noose.</p>

              <p><em>Wiener Schatten</em> (“Shadows of Vienna”) (Austria, 1933): Summary: Mysterious yet charismatic politician Klaus Baden [Conrad Veidt] rises to power and becomes mayor of Vienna, his career bolstered by former political rivals who suddenly become ardent supporters. Journalist Maria Stern [Brigitte Hornay] investigates, and discovers the sinister truth: Baden is a vampire, who is drinking the blood of his rivals and turning them into undead thralls! This thinly-veiled critique of the rise of fascism was thought to be lost, until a complete copy was discovered in a private film vault in 1962. Best Kill: In the penultimate scene, Maria confronts Baden, holding him at bay with a crucifix. In a shocking twist, Baden smiles, takes the crucifix from her, and quips, “Not even the church has power over me!” He then pulls her into an embrace and sinks his fangs into her throat. [Final image: The front page of the next day’s newspaper with a headline praising the beloved mayor. By-line: Maria Stern.]</p>

              <p>BLOOD TRACTOR (2014) - A struggling farmer finds his high tech tractor bricked because its manufacturer was sold by stock market profiteers and their servers have been shut down. Desperate, the farmer visits the DARK WEB for bootleg tractor software, little realizing they’ve downloaded a CIA trojan program that converts heavy machinery to moving murder factories! Best Kill: The tractor careens into a corn maze and the screen fills with airborne corn scraps, blood, torn clothing, screams, an entire scarecrow, even more blood, etc. while a lady in a straw hat and overalls repeats “Aww no… aww… aww no!” in dismay from a nearby pumpkin patch.</p>

              <p><em>Ghosts of Yorktown</em> (1976) Summary: Another bicentennial horror movie, this film eschews American folklore for history. The first 25 minutes of the film is a gory reenactment of Washington’s Christmas 1776 nighttime raid on the Hessian mercenary camp in Trenton (erroneously called “Yorktown” in the film). 200 years later, the ghosts of the slain Hessians re-awaken to terrorize the modern-day city. Best Kill: In 1776, a redcoat holds a Continental Army soldier at pistol-point, as a bayonet erupts from his chest. The redcoat slumps forward, to reveal George Washington himself holding the bloody musket!</p>

              <p>Bones’ Boone (1976) - As one of the more sordid examples of the folkhero horror subgenre, this movie recounts the story of Daniel Boone’s bones, and the horrible fate befalling those that had stolen them from their grave in Missouri to perform black magic with them. The movie plots doesn’t make a lot of sense, but there are are lots of gory attacks by fake animals and horrible traps in it.</p>
<p>Best kill (maybe not the best, but certainly the cheesiest): Jasper Shelby (Whittaker Pryce), a corrupt Kentucky politician, gets mauled and killed by a thing that is supposedly a bear, but is really a man in a horrible bear suit. The contrast between Pryce’s realistic screams, groans and whimpers and the Bear Man’s (uncredited) unenthusiastic growling make the scene especially hilarious.</p>

              <p><em>The Residents</em> (1992)<br>
A group of urbane university students on a roadtrip from New York to Miami take a wrong turn and get lost in a suburb near an unnamed city. They get lost among the meandering streets and identical houses that seem strangely empty of people until night falls, when the lights come on to illuminate scenes of horrific violence being played out in every window. Having run out of gas the group tries to escape the area on foot, but the residents stream out of their houses and give chase. Becky, the only main character who isn’t horribly murdered, is pushed into a previously empty house where she is forced to relive the murder of her friends over and over.</p>
<p>Best kill: The drawn-out, partially in slow motion death-by-lawnmower of Becky’s boyfriend Kenneth, played out in gruesome detail while the others are hiding in the bushes a few feet away.</p>

There is a single spot for a gymnast at the Olympics left but a strong batch of fierce competitors for that spot. As the time for the final selection in an old palace turned gymnasium approaches, contenders are dying one by one, their blood devoted to a demonic creature from beyond.<br>

<p>Best kill: When the last living pilot (played by a young Tara Drake) teams up with the track star and the drama nerd to murder her own stolen body. “We earthlings have something you don’t,” she taunts just before triggering the trap. “Life insurance.”</p>
