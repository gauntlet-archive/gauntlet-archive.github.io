          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2021/08/01/crowdfunding-collection-177/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #177, including every tabletop rpg project started between 07/25 and 08/01</b></a>.</p>
<p>The collection is back with a neatly small number of projects, including Monsterhearts 2nd edition coming to Germany. The mix English games posed more of a unique challenge, tho let’s see and get to it.</p>
<p>The second edition of the science fiction game <b>a|state RPG</b> is my clear favorite amongst the games. The new edition uses a Forged in the Dark system and presents a quite neat take on it. The game takes place in a giant, suffocating metropolis, in which the 1% basically custom designed their human form and consider those who can’t afford it as essentially not even human. Which reminds me of Gattaca but with a more capitalist take on it, or the episode „Pop Squad“ from Love, Death + Robots. Whilte it is SF, I do think I might make use of some setting elements within my VtM games. Plus, on top, it looks nice and the gimmicks are nifty. I backed it, and recommend the project. The fantasy game <b>Neoclassical Geek Revival – Acidic Edition</b> aims to fund another print run of their game, as they sold their first one. With the only stretch goal being to aim for an offset print. The narrative game, with inspiration from OGL, looks very solid, thrustworthy and gets a clear recommendation.<br>
Well, usually, my introductions of games aim at being truthful, but positive. An approach that all three projects challenged and kinda broke to various degrees (usually its like max 1 or 2 projects). Thus, if you don’t want to have a negative approach, just skip it? Let’s start with the game <b>Down With The Beargeoisie!</b> The rpg uses a d6 system and appears to be mostly based on the puns Beargeoise and ProleBeariat. While the illustration looks nice, and while I tend to be open towards left(leaning) games, this one appears to thin for my taste. Though it has more meat to it than <b>Timelines: Super Human RPG</b>. A narrative superheroe roleplaying game, which aims to be the best supes rpg ever. How you may ask? I don’t know, the project doesn’t really explain it. Then I took a look at the pledge levels…. uhm, yeah, no. Stop wasting my time. Which doesn’t get better with <b>Blackguard: A deceiver of Time</b>. The projects aims to produce a ttrpg, gamebook, manga and Netflix tv series pilot – at a wholesale cost of 66k. Stuff like the system of the ttrpg? Apparently the creators don’t bother with such trivial things, yet rather present illustrations of (imho) drastically varying qualities (from kinda nice dowards). You can back it, but in my estimate you could light your money on fire instead.<br>
Back to the cool projects! Because, there are quite some, after the games. I did back the adventure module <b>Micro Dungeons for DnD</b>. It looks great, and it comes at a total of $1 – don’t be confused by the pledge it’s in MX$. If I had a dog, or similar animal, I’d by them <b>Paw-lymorph Pet Toys</b>. Basically dice shaped food dispensers aiming to make eating fun for your companion. There are of course cool looking other dice, like the <b>Starfarer Sci-Fi Dice</b>, yet the other dice look nice too. My second favorite are <b>The Pioneer Dice</b>, even as I doubt that I would use them. The <b>SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN</b> is a quite big magazine (think Tankōbon) about post-apokalyptic topics, you can enhance the system of your choice with the modular fantasy setting <b>The Travellers Guide to Prymordia</b>, there is an <b>European Folklore Bestiary</b> for Chivalry and Sorcery and <b>A Trio of Tabletop Tomes!</b> offers a whole total stuff for the games Thunderscape, Tiny Legacies, and Infinity’s Edge.<br>
