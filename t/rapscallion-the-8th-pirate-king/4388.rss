              <p>It can certainly do the Swashbuckling but there’s some very specific magic in the 7th Sea setting, which the Mountebank and Chronicler playbooks (where most of the magic is) would struggle to replicate.  If it has a core it’s closer to Pirates of the Caribbean’s more gonzo supernatural.</p>

Captain Klaus and his crew run into difficulties while looking for the key to becoming the 8th Pirate King.  Morgana the Matelot intervenes to protect a crewmate but causes a fire to break out, while the Captain organises an ineffectual bucket chain and Percy the Mountebank comes to the rescue with the aid of his demon, ‘Grandfather’.  Later young Lucia the Swashbuckler earns her pirate stripes by craching through a window to help kidnap of an informant from under the nose of rival Captain Magda.</p>

The crew of The Black Cat are pursued through a storm by angry Captain Magda’s ship, The Uncanny Walrus. While the first cannonade favours the Walrus Captain Klaus orders ‘Ramming Speed’.  In the boarding action that follows Lucia the Swashbuckler buckles her swash while Morgana the Matelot shows how potent her fire-breathing can be.  Percy feeds his demon with Captain Magda’s life and the Captain takes crew and treasure to the Black Port of the Unquiet Dead … for a peaceful shoreleave …</p>

The crew of The Black Cat arrive at The Isle of Dread in pursuit of the key to making Captain Klaus the 8th Pirate King.  They avoid the siren call of its Leviathan guardians and make their way up to the prison the island hosts.  There they lose an informant, convince the inmates, and confuse garrrison of misfits, before making their way past traps into the bowels of the island.  There they get a harsh reminder of the victims they have left along the way …</p>
