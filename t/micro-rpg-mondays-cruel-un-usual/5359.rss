The all access time for this game is [date=2020-06-05 time=16:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;].

*This is a game of tragic and villainous tales. It is deeply unpleasant, full of elaborately and doggedly overwrought grammar, and liable to have public servants and preachers alike mourning for the damaged souls and minds of those who dare to play it. I would advise you to find an altogether lighter form of entertainment to while away your evening; perhaps your local Nickelodeon is playing the newest Michael Haneke?*

Cruel &amp; Un-usual is a tragic game of poor, nefarious, untrustworthy individuals in the vein of Count Olaf from A Series of Unfortunate Events. Players will go on a doomed adventure in order to try and earn their rightful take.

This is a one-shot. The game will take place over Zoom and will be recorded and shared on YouTube with player permission. I will send out an e-mail 3 days in advance to check on everyone&#39;s availability and provide the game materials. There will be 3 players, one spot is saved for a friend.

This game was published in Codex Melancholy. The rules will be taught at the start of the session and no prior knowledge is necessary.

## Safety Tools

We will be using script change, x-card, lines and veils, and an open door policy. All of these tools will be explained at the start of the session. This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
