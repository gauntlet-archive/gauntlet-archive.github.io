 ## Three Steps to Getting Involved
 ## Step 1: Check the RSVP Site
To see the schedule of games and to RSVP, go to the website linked below. Once you login, event start times will be listed in your local timezone (when not logged in, times shown are EDT). By default, games are presented in a list, with upcoming games at the top. You can see the games presented in different forms by clicking All Events Info or Calendar. 
[/quote]

So I:
1. go to the RSVP Site
2. click Login up top
3. select my google account
4. Login window closes but I am not logged in
5. click Login up top, again
6. Login window pops up, quick loading animation, and it closes again

Alright, so I click About, at the top:
https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/about

and it says:

Gauntlet Hangouts is our space for playing roleplaying games online. Our calendar hosts over 200 game events per month. The games played cover a variety of systems and genres, with an emphasis on indie RPGs, story games, and the OSR. People who subscribe to our Patreon at the $8+ level get one week of RSVP priority for all new games. After that week is over, anyone can join a game. If the game you want to join doesn&#39;t have room, join the waitlist! You&#39;ll receive an email notification if space opens up.
[/quote]

This _seems_ to suggest, since Patreon = priority, there is a non-Patreon (non-priority) way to engage as well, but I&#39;m still not seeing how to proceed.

There is a button that says:

Visit the Gauntlet

which takes you back to:

How can I get into the system for playing games?  I&#39;d love to join some time. :slight_smile:

Thanks!
