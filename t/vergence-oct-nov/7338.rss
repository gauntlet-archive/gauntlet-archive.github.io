    <title>Vergence (Oct/Nov)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/vergence-oct-nov/7338</link>
    <description>This is for seven sessions of *Vergence*, running Wednesday in October and November. Vergence is a Forged in the Dark game of interdimensional conflict and family drama, heavily inspired by Amber. Rules will be taught, but skimming FitD or BitD will be helpful. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. 

General RSVP opens 9/1. I am reserving one seat for someone who I haven&#39;t yet run for this year on the regular calendar—please message me if you’re interested. I’ll update this once I have someone in place.

Note: this game has some player competition elements, but not PvP.

*The Game Blurb:*
*Within the multiverse are a few places of great power called Vergences. They are ruled by families bred for the ability to open portals between worlds.*

*You play a member of one of these empowered bloodlines. Your birthright gives you the capacity to travel across infinite dimensions and manipulate reality.*

*But you’ll need to deal with conflicts involving your own powerful and manipulative family, secret conspiracies, mystical enemies, moldering gods, terrifying monsters, ancient artifacts, and existential threats with the potential to affect all the worlds of the Umbra. And possibly your annoying little sister…*

Details here: https://smallcoolgames.itch.io/vergence

But we will be using Zoom for the video meeting. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct ](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
