**We had such a good time playing Brindlewood Bay that we&#39;re back for a second season!**

Sherri Stewart is a special guest of this series!

**This series is a second run/season, but we will be pulling from the wait list if a player is unable to make it!** You do not need to be familiar with the game or story so far to jump right in, we&#39;ll take good care of you!

This session is scheduled for 3 hours. We will be using Zoom. This session may be recorded, but will only be made public if all players give their consent.

Being able to attend all sessions would be ideal, but is not required! You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. I will send a confirmation email a week ahead of the first session to confirm and with all necessary links, please reply to confirm your attendance.

***Brindlewood Bay* is a roleplaying game about a group of elderly women—members of the local Murder Mavens mystery book club—who frequently find themselves investigating (and solving!) real-life murder mysteries. They become increasingly aware that there are supernatural forces that connect the cases they are working on and, in particular, a cult dedicated to the dark, monstrous aspect of the goddess Persephone will come to vex them.**

**The game is directly inspired by the television show *Murder, She Wrote* , but also takes inspiration from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, “cozy” crime dramas, and American TV shows from the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s.**

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.

Content Warning: Cthulhu-inspired horror, themes normally associated with murder mysteries (we will be keeping everything mostly light-hearted but these things will still come up. **The last two sessions will most likely cover a more intense and horrifying mystery, so please keep that in mind!** )

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
