    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/wanted-suggestions-for-great-western-games-mechanics/6724</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for suggestions on games with an American West setting or mechanics to help shape the feel of an idea I have for a PbtA game set either on a post-event Earth or another planet, so sci-fi lens. I know that there can be some troubling tropes and I hope to avoid those and yet still capture a certain feeling about the frontier, justice, community in a different way.</description>
