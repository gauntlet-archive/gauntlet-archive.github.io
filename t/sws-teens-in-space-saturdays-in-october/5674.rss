The sound of the photon-powered battering ram echoes in your ship.
Your Kaminoan pilot informs you that the doors have an 83.4% chance of breaking with the next hit.
The cyborg Quarren to your right is checking and rechecking her enhancements.
Your hand rests on the blaster at your hip as you hear the battering ram powering up again.
As it hits, the sound of metal rending sends the rest of your crew to  **high alert** . But you smile.

*This is going to be fun...*

-----------------------------------
*Teens in Space*  is a space opera RPG that uses the “Powered by  *Kids on Bikes* ” system, first used in the award winning  *Kids on Bikes* .  *Teens in Space*  is a rules-light storytelling system  **that takes you into the cosmos for adventure and profit.**

The Adventures of  *Teens in Space*  take place across the vast and sometimes uncharted reaches of the universe, with fantastical things like: 

* Diverse and interesting alien species of all shapes and sizes
* Powerful faster than light space ships that can take you across the universe
* Strange, beautiful, and even terrifying worlds ripped right from your imagination

*Teens in Space*  takes characters to places beyond our celestial comfort zone, out into the cosmos where anything and everything *could* happen. 

A seat has been reserved for Sabine V.
