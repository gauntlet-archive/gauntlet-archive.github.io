    <description>*“No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind;*

*The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.&quot;*  ***- W.B. Yeats***

Devil&#39;s Dreams is a GMless story game, in which players share their characters’ dreams as they trade news at a meeting spot. It uses Tarot cards as prompts to create dreams and their consequences. 

These dreams come from the Devil, and are a foretelling of the future.

Set in rural Ireland at the turn of the 20th Century, this may raise issues of women’s rights, the flexibility of tradition, the clash between folklore and religion, the position of the Church and the power of British rule.
