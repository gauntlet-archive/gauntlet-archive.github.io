    <title>Good system for a Succession-style RPG?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/good-system-for-a-succession-style-rpg/5146</link>
    <description>My group has been playing campaigns of pulpy adventure in Star Wars for five years now and we&#39;re about to wrap our latest. I told my group that if we wanted to continue gaming in the Star Wars universe, I needed a tonal break from pulpy adventure in our next campaign.

So that&#39;s how we landed on **Succession but in Star Wars** as our next setting.

I&#39;m excited but nervous - this is way beyond my gaming wheelhouse even though I&#39;ve played some systems that could be adapted for this purpose.

Any system suggestions for this? I think I could do hacks of **Pasión de las Pasiones** or **Smallville** (I&#39;ve been looking for a reason to make a Cortex Prime hack anyway). **Hillfolk** also sounds adjacent but I&#39;m less familiar with that system. I was curious if there was anything else folks here would recommend, particularly if it doesn&#39;t require so much upfront work.

Specifically, here&#39;s what we mean when we say Succession:

* PCs are the main movers and shakers. They are both united and conflicted by a common interest (in this case, ownership of a massive corporation in a galaxy far, far away). There should be a roughly even mix of working together and against one another.
* The mechanics of running a business will figure into the background of the narrative. No one is particularly excited to simulate market conditions too deeply, but the business should regularly provide sources of conflict and drama.
* Very low bodycount for a Star Wars game - physical conflict should be exceedingly rare.
* The system should support a 10-15 session campaign. Some level of character advancement would be great, but we won&#39;t stick with this indefinitely.</description>

              <p>Kingdom is my favorite of the three, as it provides the most interesting resolution system for its premise.  You end up with a lot more character development than in most Microscope sessions, and deeper character conflict than you get in Follow.</p>
<p>However, some of the PbtAs you mentioned above (like Monsterhearts) push the narrative in ways that can surprise everyone at the table (because of the specifity of moves outcomes).  If that’s what you mean by ‘exciting’, Kingdom is unlikely to provide that.  It’s much more interested in conflicting agendas than in dramatic twists and turns, in my experience.</p>

Others here have recommended these systems for generating histories and backgrounds - that may be worth a shot with Kingdom to establish what came before the start of play.</p>

              <p>These are all great suggestions so far, thanks!</p>
<p>The faction-based play of <strong>Legacy</strong> looks close-but-not-quite – players would not represent factions but members of a single faction.</p>
<p><strong>Primetime Adventures</strong> looks super compelling though, I’ll give that a readthrough before I make a decision.</p>
<p>Glad to hear I’m not crazy for wanting to hack <strong>Smallville</strong> - Cortex games are my go-to anytime I want to emulate a TV show (<strong>Leverage</strong> will always have a special place in my heart). The latest Cortex Prime is confusing as heck but I think I’d be fine to start with Smallville and make modifications by stealing from Prime until I have the game I want.</p>

<p>It’s a totally narrative-based game for playing ongoing drama series (<em>Hillfolk</em> borrows from it, and would also probably work well for this). You’d need to not care about anything ‘tactical’, but it’d be great for board-room shenanigans.</p>

<p>Specifically, here’s what we mean when we say Succession:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCs are the main movers and shakers. They are both united and conflicted by a common interest (in this case, ownership of a massive corporation in a galaxy far, far away). There should be a roughly even mix of working together and against one another.</li>
<li>The mechanics of running a business will figure into the background of the narrative. No one is particularly excited to simulate market conditions too deeply, but the business should regularly provide sources of conflict and drama.</li>
<li>Very low bodycount for a Star Wars game - physical conflict should be exceedingly rare.</li>
<li>The system should support a 10-15 session campaign. Some level of character advancement would be great, but we won’t stick with this indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
