    <title>(Playtesting Weekend) Viva la QueerBar! (2)</title>

    <description>“Viva la QueerBar!” is a slice-of-life storygame about a queer bar (or café) and the people who run it (the player characters). During the game, we’ll tell a story about queer community, identity, creativity, exclusion, and solidarity. The game is GM-less, diceless, and based on Descended from the Queen mechanics.

The core mechanics of the game are finalized. This is primarily a playtest of the English translation of the game and to see how it works with an international group. Please only sign up if you’re willing to give feedback afterwards.

**Duration:** About 2 hours of play time, with 1-2 short breaks (5-10 minutes), and extra time for feedback.

**Content notes:** Depending on the questions that are drawn, the setting we chose, and the Lines and Veils we established, the game may touch on romance/sexuality, alcohol/drug use, LGBTQIA+ antagonism/repression from the outside, and conflicts within queer communities. That said, all of the questions position queer people as having agency, and the majority of the questions are about joyful or neutral topics.

**Safety Tools:** Open Door, Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, breaks, discussion about setting and tone. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct applies. https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html

**Platforms used:** Jitsi for the video call, StorySynth for the game (browser-based), Google Sheets for the safety tools (no account necessary).

I’ll send out a reminder the week before the session to confirm attendance and share the relevant links.

**Recording:** This session will be recorded and shared with my co-designer. If you consent (I’ll ask after the session), it may also be posted on the internet when the game is published for publicity.

**Sign-ups:** https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MvJjUw72L9aLorOxoxF
