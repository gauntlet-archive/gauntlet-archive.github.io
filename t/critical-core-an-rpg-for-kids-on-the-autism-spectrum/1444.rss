<p>I want that as a poster!</p>
<p>It looks like the Critical Core folks have been on a podcast tour, that might be a good way to learn more.<br>

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/yoshi">@yoshi</a>.</p>
<p>I’m excited Critical Core exists (and is funding <em>really</em> well on KS):</p>
<p>We all know RPGs are great for learning and socialization, and I love that Game to Grow is focusing that tool for some of the folks who need it the most.</p>
<p>I was curious what kind of research or consulting they did on the project.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/coalhada">@Coalhada</a>, I think you know someone that was working on this (as a consultant), right?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jtreat3">@jtreat3</a>, welcome to the community! What about Critical Core interests you? Are there things that particularly excite you?</p>
<p>I’ve backed it. For me, I am really excited to see how do teaching of rules, what handouts they have, what techniques and tools for easing cognitive load, what adaptations and design considerations they have made.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest. I’m not sure I’ll actually play it, but I do plan on reading it and studying it, even if the actual system never hits my table.</p>
