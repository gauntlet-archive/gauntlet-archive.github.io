          <p>I have noticed something interesting after listening to the <a href="../fear-of-a-black-dragon-death-on-the-reik-part-1/1575.html">Death on Reik Fear of Black Dragon episode</a>. <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasoncordova">@jasoncordova</a> mentioned that the module feels very <em>pastoral</em>, which I understood means it was unlike the OSR feel he is used to.</p>
<p>Now, I have grown up on Death on Reik and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 1ed in general, so this is pretty much my old school gaming experience. When I stumbled upon OSR as a movement somewhere in early 2000s I understood it through this lens. When I read new OSR materials I run them in a similar manner, very mundane and grimdark. I often cut out combat encounters so the game would not be that combat focused. I mean, there is still magic and monsters, but they are the exception rather than a rule‚Ä¶</p>
<p>What I am getting at is that I think I was not running the same OSR as people who have grown up with D&amp;D. The themes are similar, but the overall feel of the game might be different. I find it really curious.</p>
<p>So here‚Äôs my question to you - what do you understand by OSR? How do you play/run such games? Let‚Äôs skip mechanics here and focus on themes and ‚Äúfeel.‚Äù Is your OSR about heroes saving the day (even if they are not super powered like in contemporary D&amp;D)? Is it vagabonds wandering from place to place in a more pastoral manner, stumbling upon adventure while knee deep in mud? Maybe it is something else?</p>
<p>It would also be great if you shared what was your first RPG system, and maybe where are you from (country is plenty if you don‚Äôt want to share personal info)‚Ä¶ I sense some correlation here.</p>

          <p>Okay, I say this as someone who has looked at OSR stuff and not really had any interest in it (note this does not make it bad, it‚Äôs just not my flavour of fun if it is yours please partake deeply and freely), but I feel that it goes to the last point that you put up there. For me a lot of the drive feels like there it comes from a nostalgia love for D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Which is something I always admire and get behind. I mean so many things we design are based around those types of feelings, you can‚Äôt help but get behind it.</p>
<p>My issue is that my first RPG was Cyberpunk 2020, and so I don‚Äôt have a lot of those same feelings. It was the same thing with Dungeon World which I thought looked good but <em>did not understand why everyone was having feelings about it</em> and when <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jmstar">@Jmstar</a> waxed poetic about childhood experience with D&amp;D that‚Äôs when I understood why I didn‚Äôt get it in the same way everyone else was.</p>
<p>My possible addendum to this would be if someone has cyberpunk OSR stuff, I‚Äôd love to see it because that‚Äôs my nostalgia bag.</p>

          <p>I mean if you want to revisit that <em>Cyberpunk 2020</em> material with a different system you really can‚Äôt beat <em>Veil 2020</em> from Codex - Chrome 2. It‚Äôs is exactly what <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/frasersimons">@Frasersimons</a> designed it to do. It‚Äôs a great melding of <em>The Veil</em>, <em>Whitehack</em>, and WoDu.</p>

          <p>I do run OSR games, and the first game I played and ran was Basic D&amp;D, for me though OSR is not about nostalgia. I‚Äôm not trying to recapture the games of my youth because the games of my youth were rubbish.</p>
<p>There are many different factors which make a game OSR, but for every rule you write there will be a game out there which breaks it.</p>
<p>The things that keep me running OSR are the variety of indie content which can all be mixed together, and the acknowledgment that player agency is king.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to run a preplanned game. I don‚Äôt want to share the creation of my setting with my players. I want to set up an awesome fantasy world and then sit back and watch my players explore it.</p>
<p>To be honest, I guess there is a sort of connection to me as a young gamer: I am now running the sort of games I used to wish I knew how to run.</p>

          <p>I started with OD&amp;D in the mists of time. What I liked about it was that there were fewer rules codified that meant you could (ironically) do more. I enjoyed the immersive ness of it (you didn‚Äôt ‚Äúroll to search for something‚Äù you looked under the bed, unscrewed the bedposts, checked the lintel.</p>
<p>I know that isn‚Äôt for everyone, but that kind investigate the jungle/live in the town yin/yang of game existence was a lot of fun back then.</p>
<p>If I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôve not looked at OSR rulesets in the last decade or so‚Ä¶ but if I did, I‚Äôd be interested to see whether they still supported that kind of descriptive immersion which was so common back then.</p>

          <p>That is a big part of a lot of OSR play.</p>
<p>WhiteBox is an update of oD&amp;D and plays basically as you describe it. Even better though, check out Into The Odd or Maze Rats, both are even lighter than oD&amp;D and are all about players thinking their way through situations, rather than rolling dice on an appropriate skill.</p>

<p>Do you find that your OSR games emulate the feeling of your original games? Because I certainly do. Before today I thought OSR being more of a monolithic movement, back to the very roots of the hobby, but it seems on a personal level I am going back to the roots of <em>my</em> hobby.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I think that‚Äôs probably right. Every table‚Äôs OSR is different and right now I am running a slow apocalypse very similar to something I wanted to run back in the day.</p>
<p>Some people use OSR to revisit the pulp fantasy they read as kids. Others are going for a more Saturday morning cartoons vibe. Some just want Dungeons, but huge!</p>

          <p>I come to the OSR from a different angle; I always wanted to check out D&amp;D or similar as a kid, but it never really happened. I had some friends that were into Vampire, but they did LARPing and for a teen who was very very insecure and concerned with hiding their inner dorkiness, I never took the plunge. My first exposure to D&amp;D was looking through a bandmate‚Äôs AD&amp;D 2E material, but I didn‚Äôt really <em>play</em> until well into adulthood when I played Pathfinder and then later 5E. I ran 5E a few times as well, after getting some feedback that I‚Äôd probably make a good DM. I think I‚Äôve done a good job running 5E, but I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. Or rather, there was a lot about it I did enjoy that felt undermined by things like running combat or setting difficulty classes and keep tracking of too many numbers. It felt like it was beyond the limit of my cognitive load. I was cognitively encumbered! Further, the kinds of stories we were telling weren‚Äôt that interesting to me. I kept wanting to make things <em>weirder</em>, and more difficult, and for some reason it felt like doing so was causing tension with the other mechanics. I didn‚Äôt want combat to always be the only option, and felt it should only very rarely be the <em>best</em> option. But D&amp;D, for better and worse, is pretty much built entirely around combat.</p>
<p>I still enjoy 5E as a player in my friend‚Äôs ongoing campaign, but I realized running it just wasn‚Äôt for me.</p>
<p>Around the same time I discovered Dungeon World, which seemed to be ticking all my boxes. The focus on the fiction and narrative complications over binary skill checks was revelatory for me, and the idea that the moves on the playbook weren‚Äôt a menu of options but mechanics that may or may not get triggered opened things up; in 5E it often feels like you can only do stuff that correlates to your skills. In DW it felt like you could do <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>And then I started exploring the various hacks of DW, and started to learn more about the OSR. The personalities and the seeming dogma of OSR as a community turned me off (since often it‚Äôs the loudest, most awful voices that are easiest to encounter) but checking out some of the various retro-clones, I knew this kind of play was more what I was looking for. Some of the particulars of some of them went over my head or past me, since I never played OD&amp;D or b/x or whatever else, and it did feel obvious that some mechanics were only in there for purely nostalgic reasons. I still felt I was more into the narrative focus of DW, but there was no doubt these games seemed better geared to play around with the kind of gonzo nonsense that seemed most fun to me.</p>
<p>And then I happened into a playtest of <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a>‚Äô  Freebooters on the Frontier 2E, which felt like it marries some of the best stuff from DW with the best stuff from the OSR. And while the playtest kind of fell through, I decided to run my own game, and seven months in, it‚Äôs been an incredible experience. Early on, one of the players reported back that ‚Äúit feels like my level one character just happened into a high level campaign, and <em>it‚Äôs awesome</em>.‚Äù It was pretty much the best compliment ever.</p>
<p>So for me, it‚Äôs not about nostalgia, because I can‚Äôt be nostalgic for something I‚Äôve never experienced. ‚ÄúMy OSR‚Äù is about plunderers, in over their heads, traversing the dangerous wilderness in search of riches, being hopelessly outmatched at every turn. It‚Äôs dangerous, it‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs got some creeping cosmic horror, and the fun comes not from being superheroes saving the world, but from surviving and forming community in a world that‚Äôs brutal and uncaring. And occasionally being heroes and getting involved in political conspiracies where they‚Äôre maybe even more in over their heads than when exploring dungeons and fighting monstrosities.</p>

          <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/von_bednar">@Von_Bednar</a> the feel of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay  seems like something pretty well represented in the OSR. There‚Äôs even a B/Xification of it called ‚ÄúA Small but Vicious Dog‚Äù (named for one piece of the rat-catchers starting equipment.) Grim and grotty low fantasy with heavy doses of dark humor is a common aesthetic. Trent B‚Äôs New Feierland setting, which was a big campaign on google plus and FLAILSNAILS had that aesthetic. The grotty and quirky aspect also shapes numerous other things from Troika to many of Michael Raston‚Äôs creations. Also WFRP had a metal/punk aesthetic with demon gods and mutations and dwarves with giant Mohawks, etc. These are common aesthetic impulses and themes throughout the OSR. To be clear, I like all that stuff but it isn‚Äôt the aesthetic at my table. For me It‚Äôs more Lord Dunsany and E.R. Eddison, dreamy sometimes romantic, but tempered by Vancian low cunning. (Among other things.)</p>

          <p>For me the OSR is less about nostalgia for D&amp;D as it actually was and more about D&amp;D as I wanted it to be as a teen.</p>
<p>As it was: <em>Holmes Basic</em> and <em>Keep on the Borderlands</em>, which had the vibe of the <em>Hobbit</em> animated movie, <em>David the Gnome</em>, or the non-metal parts of Ralph Bakshi‚Äôs <em>Wizards</em>. Later, 2E and its more heroic fantasy vibe. I ran these things pure gonzo, with bands of monkies ambushing the players on the way to the Caves of Chaos, an evil priest with a pumpkin for a head, and a Xenomorph invasion.</p>
<p>As I wanted it to be: Frank Frazetta paintings, metal album covers, the metal parts of <em>Wizards</em>. (For better or worse, I never got to play <em>Dark Sun</em> or <em>Rifts</em> as a kid).</p>
<p><em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em>, the Hyrda Cooperative stuff, the ‚Äú<a href="https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2016/09/osr-aesthetics-of-ruin.html" rel="nofollow noopener">aesthetics of ruin</a>,‚Äù and the various ‚Äú<a href="https://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2018/12/what-is-artpunk.html" rel="nofollow noopener">artpunk</a>‚Äù stuff is what I‚Äôm drawn to. I have to say though, that I had a lot more fun running the very silly 1974 teenage-authored <em><a href="http://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2014/08/1974-dungeon-variant-now-for-download.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Rules to the Game of Dungeon</a></em>, which ended up feeling a lot like the silly games I ran as a teen, than I did running <em>Deep Carbon Observatory</em> with <em>Black Hack</em>. Go figure.</p>

          <p>This is a super interesting observation to me! This makes me think about the OSR maybe being imbued with or underpinned by this sort of caricature of masculinity based on teenage ideals‚Äìand I think this makes sense to some degree, and what was some of what turned me off to the OSR when I first started investigating it, not that I could have put a name on it. I think about the entire aesthetic of Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and so much of it feels wrapped up in that sort of teenage edginess and envelope-pushing.</p>
<p>Does that make sense, or is it off-base?</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying that stuff can‚Äôt be <em>cool</em>. I love Frazetta, and a lot of metal, and there are a number of elements of that kind of aesthetic that appeals to me. And I don‚Äôt mean to judge anyone who is into those things, either, so I hope it doesn‚Äôt come across that way. I think about some of my favorite DCC adventures which are <em>absolutely ridiculous</em> but totally freakin‚Äô awesome at the same time. I think it can be more of a ‚Äúboth, and‚Äù situation.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think it depends on the specific LotFP product, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre far off. DCC has a sort of earnest embrace of the ridiculousness of its Appendix N source material, while at the same time trying to temper the more problematic elements of that. A lot of artpunk stuff seems to be more interested in subverting old tropes. But there‚Äôs plenty of stuff in the OSR that just leans into adolescent edginess with no effort to correct or subvert.</p>

          <p>There is a lot of that for sure. Both in Lamentations and DCC and others too. Some of it is more Saturday Morning Cartoons and would rather be awesome in its weirdness than edgy.</p>
<p>Some of it though is so much more than that. Yoon Suin is so special because it‚Äôs a truly new place which begs you to explore it, and because it‚Äôs all procedural, the only way to explore it is to play it.</p>
<p>Into The Odd presents a post industrial revolution sprawling city just a few steps to the left of anything you know, and then it tells you to go and create something new to use in it.</p>
<p>So it‚Äôs certainly not all edgy. Some of it just wants surprise you by taking you places you haven‚Äôt been before. This might seem odd since the mechanics are routed in the past but no one planned that and maybe it makes it easier to explore a new place if the rules are already familiar?</p>

          <p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jexjthomas">@jexjthomas</a> I can see how you might say that about some Lamentations stuff, since it‚Äôs rooted in a (supposedly) transgressive aesthetic of gore splatter, body horror, and so on, and the products are mainly written by men. Also about DCC which is aesthetically based on the art work that was airbrushed on vans in the 1980s. But I think this not what‚Äôs going on at all with a LOT of OSR stuff. Think about Emmy Allen‚Äôs Gardens of Ynn which is a sort of art nouveau through the garden door aesthetic, or Patrick Stuart‚Äôs the Veins of the Earth which involves an aesthetic of the horror of deep geological time. Or about the goofy slavic socialist aesthetic of The Hill Cantons.</p>

          <p>This is fair. I was definitely painting with a broad brush/speaking in generalities. I appreciate you taking the time to point out the flaws in that, and talk more about the products that are something other than that and have a lot to offer. I‚Äôm particularly interested in hearing more about The Hill Cantons because that sounds up my alley‚Äìthough hopefully we‚Äôre not getting too far off-topic.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre getting off topic, but I‚Äôm always happy to talk about The Hill Cantons. The setting is a mythic slavic setting. A Church of the Sun (a stand in for you know what) has conquered the pagan Pahr people, pushing back a weird wilderness loosely based on slavic pre-Christian sources of inspiration. Here‚Äôs some visual inspiration for the setting:</p>

          <p>That point about D&amp;D ‚Äúas you wanted it to be‚Äù resonates with me. A guy I know in the Oldhammer community said the same thing about what Oldhammer meant to him: ‚ÄúI want to play these impressive games with these beautiful models <em>like I wanted to when I was a kid.</em>‚Äù Not like we <em>did</em> when we were kids.</p>
<p>I never played a lot of D&amp;D when I was younger, but I did play other fantasy RPGs, and I had the same response, which was that I could <em>feel</em> this weird and mysterious thing just out of reach but games never quite worked out that way in practice. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm OSR enough to be OSR ‚Äì I just use stuff from the modules in 5e games ‚Äì but that‚Äôs the thing that I think of as OSR. Even the more explicitly retro-recreationist aspects of the community, which don‚Äôt do anything for me personally, I think are trying to recreate the feel of a time when dungeon exploration was a journey into the unknown and not a day at the office.</p>

          <p>I definitely agree with this.</p>
<p>4e was my first RPG, so I don‚Äôt have any nostalgia for old-school games.</p>
<p>But I love the feeling of putting impossible challenges in front of my players and watching them use cleverness and twisted logic to overcome it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also had groups that struggle with the PbtA structure. E.g. they don‚Äôt have a good sense for story-telling and just want to kill shit and overcome challenges. OSR has been perfect for those groups.</p>
