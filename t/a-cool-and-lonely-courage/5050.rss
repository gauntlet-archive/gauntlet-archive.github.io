    <title>A Cool and Lonely Courage</title>

    <description>This is a tragic role playing story game about the heroic women of the SOE (Special Operations Executive) during World War II.

The game starts with each of you captured by the Nazis, facing interrogation and death at their hands. Together as players you tell the lonely stories of these brave women through their deployment, missions, and eventual capture, and discover their lives through flashbacks.

The game ends with the players discovering who lives, who dies, who tells their stories.

**Content &amp; Safety:**

A Cool and Lonely Courage won’t necessarily be an easy game to run or be part of. The stories can be powerful and emotional.

The game is designed to be emotionally engaging, but not to make anyone feel uncomfortable. As a group of players, we should agree beforehand how dark we want our game to be. We may want to be cautious about including elements of interrogation or torture even though they happened in real life, and it’s OK to do that. Although the game is about serious topics, it doesn’t need to involve detailed descriptions of traumatising events.

I expect that we will encounter some uncomfortable topics (with Nazis to worry about) – but in any case we&#39;ll have a safety discussion at the start and use **Script Change**.

The session will be recorded on **Zoom** but will only be made public afterwards with everyone&#39;s consent.
