    <title>How to play Dungeon World?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/how-to-play-dungeon-world/4241</link>
    <description>I put a how to play guide together for newer players of Dungeon World. Apologies for any mistakes, I am not a natural solo-DM-player combo and missed having some players to bounce the fiction about. However the focus was the combat and basic moves, so I have hopefully covered those OK. Feedback welcome.

              <p>Thanks for the feedback. Unfortunately I am a bit monotone and always have been. I certainly think it’s something I can work on though, I know I have some energy in me for more stimulating presentation of information. I will give that some attention on the next video.</p>

              <p>Overall it’s a solid introduction.</p>
<p>You covered a good range of events in a typical dungeon bash, and showing the minatures was a good call to help those who are not used to theatre of the mind keep track of what was going on.</p>
<p>Only area of ‘needs improvement’ is some of it was a bit monotone, you may want to work on showing more emotional emphasis from time to time for future videos.</p>
<p>I will plug this vid on twitter.</p>
