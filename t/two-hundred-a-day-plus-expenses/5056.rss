    <description>Hello,
It&#39;s been a while since I didn&#39;t hear of Master Ravachol&#39;s new works. I liked following Lincoln Green journey through the woods but nothing came out, or so it seems. So I took to track tracks and found this : one conference for Make talk play and, lo : a trekkie podcast series with Nathan D. Paoletta. 
Anyone knows about it ? ... or what came of Lincoln Green ?</description>

              <p>The ‘Trekkie podcast’ is actually a Rockford Files podcast that does a once-a-year Star Trek episode as a gentle, running April Fools gag.</p>
<p>As far as I know Eppie is still plugging away at Lincoln Green; he generally has several irons in the fire at any given time, and his stuff drops when it drops and not on any sort of aggressive regular schedule.</p>
