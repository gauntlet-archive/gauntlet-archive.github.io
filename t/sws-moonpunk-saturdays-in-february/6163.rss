*&quot;You can&#39;t defeat Warlord Zsinj!&quot;* is a bunch of poodoo! There are literally hundreds of ways to take down an oppressive regime! MoonPunk is filled with them.

MoonPunk is a standalone political action Powered by the Apocalypse roleplaying game for 3-7 people. Play as punks on the moon of Belthu fighting the good fight against oppression. Use subversive action to take down The Empire, spread the truth about corruption, protest the corporate, or just punch some stormtroopers.

So sew on some patches, spike up your hair, and turn it up to 11. The show&#39;s about to start.
