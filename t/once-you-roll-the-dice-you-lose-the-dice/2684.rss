    <description>Are there any rpgs that once you roll dice, the dice go away, and become something else?  
Fiasco does this(without the rolling part). Is there another game that also keeps tally of dice?</description>

              <p>I have a courtroom drama RPG where you gradually generate die pools then roll them, and they go away. There’s a pool of Contempt Dice you get through objections, and then a pool of Verdict Dice you build with your arguments. At certain points you roll them and they generate an effect and then go away.</p>
