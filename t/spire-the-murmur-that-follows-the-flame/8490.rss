    <title>Spire: The Murmur that Follows the Flame</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/spire-the-murmur-that-follows-the-flame/8490</link>
    <description>This is Spire. A mile-high city in the land of Destera, ruled by cruel high elves, in which the drow – you, and your family, and your friends – have been oppressed for centuries. A nightmare warren of twisting passages and structures, built and rebuilt, atop itself. A city of a thousand gods. The furthest bastion of a terrible and burgeoning empire. A structure of unknown make that houses a blistering, rotten hole in reality at its centre where the sane dare not tread.

You have joined the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress, a paramilitary religious group that worships a forbidden goddess, and sworn in blood to avenge the wrongs placed upon you and your people. You have made an oath to fight the high elves, to subvert and capture their resources, and to take Spire back into dark elf hands once more, rebuild it for you and yours.

This is 9 sessions of Rowan Rook &amp; Deckard&#39;s *Spire: The City Must Fall* . It is scheduled for Monday nights in Janurary and Februrary 2023 at 830 PM US Eastern Time.

Content: The focus of this series is on The Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress as a **revolutionary religious community.** It will focus on questions of belonging, belief and rebellion. **What will your characters do for your freedom, your god(s) and your loved ones? What are the costs of revolution, and who will be forced to pay them?** **Are you here to burn the city down, or to rebuild it better?**

**CW: Revolutionary and state violence, terrorism, harm to civilians and bystanders, fantasy racism.**

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. All-Access time is 12:00 PM US Eastern November 9, 2022. A seat is saved for Thomas Manuel.

We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links and resources. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), as well as Script Change for safety tools.
