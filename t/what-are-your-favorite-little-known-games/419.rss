              <p>We played both versions. Both are mostly usable games as they are.<br>
I haven’t written anything up. It was mostly flying by the seat of our pants and just coming up with custom moves or altering existing moves where it felt needed. It was years ago. Unfortunately, I’m not able to recall any specifics at the moment. I do remember writing up the details of some of the spells that were named but not fleshed out.</p>

I love the mechanics, and how collaboration is baked into the system. I’ve yet to find another game where this is merged in such an elegant way. Also I always enjoy how different the story can develop, and how much can be built from this quite simple pretense: You’re running away from this strange organization, you’ve lost your memory, you have powers, you have those questions you seek answers to.<br>
I’ve run and played this a couple of times, and this game just totally works for me.</p>

              <p>I’m going to rhapsodise a little more about G/E. I really think it was a missed opportunities in the history of indie game design. Not much came out of it at the time except a few enthusiastic hacks. But nothing lasting has happened because of it in the design space, which I think is a shame. It’s the game I always want to play, and the one I am trying to design around.</p>

It’s not much talked about anymore because the author, John Harper, went on to create the new hotness, BitD. I wish more people played Ghost/Echo, and took design cues from it. It’s my favourite game, my favourite desgn. I love it because of the simplicity of Otherkind dice, the oracle lists, the story-gaminess, the visual aesthetic, and the setting possibilities. I think it’s a masterpiece of minimalist game design.</p>

The players are screenwriters, locked in a room and told they have to come up with a three act screenplay for a Highlander sequel. Never saw Highlander? Saw it, but only have vague memories of the film? Doesn’t matter… the clock’s ticking.</p>
<p>The GM plays a studio exec who keeps interrupting with more script demands and notes and anything said aloud becomes canon and enters the screenplay immediately. Once time is up, players take turn acting out/improving scenes from their screenplay. And finally, everyone is asked if their screenplay is <em>more</em> or <em>less</em> stupid than the actual Highlander sequel.</p>
<p>Then the Wikipedia summary of Highlander II is read aloud, and we see if anyone’s answers change.</p>
<p>Playing this game at New Mexicon was a laughing-'til-you’re-crying revelation for me.</p>

              <p>Even though I’ve not played either for far too long I absolutely love Hell 4 Leather and Remember Tomorrow. Two great and compact games that hit the nail on the head in terms of getting the genre feels they’re aiming for. With Remember Tomorrow I especially love how you can build an expanding setting through serialised stories that loosely overlap without necessarily following on from one another. Very much in keeping with Gibson’s original Sprawl novels.</p>

<p>Clerics in the San Jenaro Quarterly Game Digest is a blast - you play a team of OSR clerics trying to save the asses of your idiotic NPC party. Tons of fun!</p>

<li>
<p>Mothership - I think this is still considered small time even though it won 2 Ennies… Such an atmospheric OSR. I have really enjoyed running this game for the Aliens feel and carte Blanche allowed to create any sort of weird space effects.  The Dead Planet supplement is super creepy and has a fun way to create abandoned ships.  It was my vote for best supplemental of the year.</p>

<p>It’s a poverty simulator, a game of economic horror where the world ended but the rent is still due. This game gives your characters a reason to go into those ‘dungeons’ (in this case, the infested dangerous regions of the Loss) and bring back the loot, and gives you a reason to keep on doing it till you buy yourself and the ones who depend on you a better life - or until debt, danger and death brings you crashing down.</p>
<p>A wonderful mechanic for finding jobs and negotiating contracts, a crunchy system that abstracts enough to keep it fluid and tracks enough to keep it meaningful, RM provides for excellent tensions that go beyond mere hit points or sanity trackers. When the job goes wrong, do you cut your losses or double down? You’re not a party of heroes, you’re co-workers in a hostile environment.</p>
<p>Mainly I love that the gear/resource management is just crunchy enough to be fun and light enough to never get in the way - and that finally, a game where ‘money units’ actually mean something beyond buying sick loot. Got to save for Retirement, as people don’t get old by going over the wall…</p>
