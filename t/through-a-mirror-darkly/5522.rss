This is a playtest of Jamila Nedjadi&#39;s game in development of deep space horror.
This is a one-shot, GM-less, game though I will facilitate the session and guide you through the mechanics as they arise.
**All Access Date: 5 July 2020**
I will be in touch with those who RSVP about a week in advance.

This game is designed to include, even encourage, character death but players will remain involved as they will take on playable aspects of the Palantir&#39;s &#39;personality&#39; that will challenge the remaining characters and take on a role more usually associated with a GM.
The session will run for 3 hours and will be recorded.
You must be prepared for that recording to be shared with Jamila for game development purposes, however agreement will be sought to also post it to my Youtube channel.

**Concept** : Something went badly wrong aboard the Palantir and now you&#39;re going there to find out what.
**Aim** : We will define the Palantir&#39;s mission and some of its characteristics as well as the unknown horror(s) that lurks aboard. Then we&#39;ll play to find out ...
**Tone &amp; Subject Matter** : This is a dark game in which characters will die or, perhaps even worse, be twisted by their experiences aboard the Palantir. The principle touchstone is Event Horizon (1997) but, depending on the way we shape the Palantir and the play, we could also touch on aspects of Life (2017), Alien (1979), Sunshine (2007), or Solaris (1972), among others.
We could therefore [ **CONTENT WARNING** ] see gore, body horror, psychological horror, the dragging up of character&#39;s dark past, the stripping away of characters&#39; personalities to reveal true motives.

We will, therefore, be using the  **Safety Tools**  espoused by the Gauntlet Community:
**LINES:**  My starting lines, which we will not see in the fiction, are  **Sexual Violence**  &amp;  **Violence against Children**  ...  ***though given the subject matter, we may see the implied threat of these, or their consequences***  ...
**VEILS:**  My starting veils, which may occur in the fiction, though at that point we will fade to black, are  **Sex**  &amp;  **Torture** .

Players will have an opportunity to add to these Lines or Veils at the start of the session, but be aware of the CONTENT WARNING above; some things will be difficult to line or veil given the premise of the series. If those things worry you then this is probably not the game for you

**THE X-CARD**  will also be in use, as will the  **Gauntlet Code of Conduct**  (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html), and we&#39;ll be running with a  **Open Door.**</description>
