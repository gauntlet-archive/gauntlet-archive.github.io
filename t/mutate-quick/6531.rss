    <description>Hello, 
I catch myself referencing old games all the time. Of course, many things have already been done, and it&#39;s not bad to know of them. But how many games have you seen recently that really break the routine ? It&#39;s been a while since I haven&#39;t heard of Epidiah Ravachol&#39;s last insight / prank. According to this article by Levi Kornelsen, we need more of them :

Where, on what game jam, are the petridishest game drafts, stuff to make a reader wonder &quot;how would you play that ?&quot; &quot;is it even a game ?&quot;</description>

              <p>I don’t have an answer to that but I’ve been thinking about the arbitrary limitations we construct around games lately as I try to figure out how to promote <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-hallowed-walk-a-story-game-you-play-by-going-for-a-walk-outside/5788/2">The Hallowed Walk</a> - having a game using a story-prompt type mechanic that is played outside while going on a walk turns out to be quite tricky when so many gaming communities include “tabletop” right there in the name and although this is a game that would appeal to people in those groups it is explicitly <em>not</em> a tabletop game. It’s not a board game either, and although it is technically a card game again people don’t tend to think about playing those outside or incorporating them into their walks.</p>
