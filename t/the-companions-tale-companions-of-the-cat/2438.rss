    <title>The Companion&#39;s Tale: Companions of the Cat</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-companions-tale-companions-of-the-cat/2438</link>
    <description>This session is scheduled for four hours. It will be recorded and posted with players&#39; permission.

We will be playing The Companion&#39;s Tale, by Laura Simpson. This game is a single session, and will use Roll20 to manage the game&#39;s cards.

The Companion&#39;s Tale is a game of telling the story of a great hero, from the perspective of their various companions. It&#39;s a game of collaborative world-creation, map-drawing, and conflicting interpretations of history. This session will be played with a twist: the great hero whose deeds we are describing is a cat.

The X card, lines and veils, and the open door policy will be in effect. This event abides by the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.
