    <description>## Notes

* **In Development** : This game is currently in development, and this session is a play test. Please sign up only if you’re OK playing an unpolished game. I promise we will have fun.
* **Two Players** : This game is for two players and one GM. Players play a mismatched pair, seeking to overcome their differences to take down a threat they could not face singly.

## The Story

As you and your partner make your way across the Windswept Prairie, you come upon an older traveler who introduces themselves as The Great Sage Udrioch. Looking dejected and desperate they confess that the mercenaries hired to escort them to the kingdom beyond the mountains ran off at the first sign of trouble. They make you an enticing offer... and you’re headed that way anyway to fence some trinkets you stole of a conman, who -- let’s face it -- had it coming.

## The Pitch

In A Thousand Quests and A Hundred Lifetimes, players take on the role of a pair of mismatched adventurers. They are mercenaries for hire or ne’er-do-wells causing trouble or just a couple vagabonds seeking their fortune.

## Touchstones

Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser (Leiber); Xena and Gabrielle; Geralt and Jaskier; The Gentlemen of the Road (Chabon)

## About the Game

A Thousand Quests uses the Trust system, the rules at the heart of [My Partner the Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtITZejP-VxXajKSNRoyFJ1Jz1q9f9WqI) and [Team-Up](https://cosmicbeagle.itch.io/team-up). The characters share one attribute score -- Trust. As their trust level goes up, they unlock new ways of working together. Ultimately this game is about overcoming differences to take down a threat.
