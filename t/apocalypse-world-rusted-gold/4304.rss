**There&#39;s something wrong with the world and I don&#39;t know what it is...**

Okay, maybe I&#39;m lying a bit. I did graft some of this together after all! Welcome to an Apocalypse World 2e game, a game of past glories and current harshness with slick, dangerous characters.

I will be setting up a world skeleton we will build onto. This world is one of excess turned foul – the world before was gilded so you couldn&#39;t see the rot underneath. Now there is so much waste and the useful stuff can be buried under so much trash. Now there are the warlords and luxurious marketeers.

Who are you going to be in a world turned sour thanks to human greed and decadence?

I am looking for four players. You must RSVP for every session you plan to attend and I would prefer if you could RSVP for every session. The first session will be scheduled for 3.5 hours while the rest will be 3.

Safety tools will be in use, including the X-Card, lines &amp; veils, and script change tools. The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy is in effect as well as the Open Door Policy. This game will not be recorded.
