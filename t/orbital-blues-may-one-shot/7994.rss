    <title>Orbital Blues (May one shot)</title>

    <description>*These are the music-fuelled, moon-age daydreams of a rebel space age. The backstreets of every terraformed metropolis brim with a thousand lonely hearts and a thousand more venal vendettas. The burnt-out wastelands between bright lights are lawless bat countries—anachronistic Americana languishing beneath multiple moons. Madness lies in every direction at every solar hour.*

Orbital Blues is a rules-light, OSR-inspired game of sad space cowboys hustling desperately to get out from under insurmountable debts in a dilapidated retro future. We’ll be playing the stripped back rules from the Unchained Melody quickstart. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter includes sadness and yearning, and may include violence, alcohol, gambling and drug use. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

The session will run on Zoom, with short breaks on the hour. I’ve scheduled four hours to make sure we have enough time to find a satisfying ending or climax, but will aim to finish up nearer to three hours. I don’t intend to record the session.

I’ll email the players a week before the session to share play materials and confirm attendance. 

Open access time for sign ups is 6pm 6th April AEST.
