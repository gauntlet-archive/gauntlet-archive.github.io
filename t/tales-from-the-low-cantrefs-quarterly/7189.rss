    <description>There is something rotten in the Low Cantrefs. No-one knows when it started but all agree that the land is living under a shadow. Fields are planted. Cottages are built, and roofs thatched. Namedays and baptisms are celebrated, and the harvest welcomed in. Babies are born. People fall in love, make new friends, cling to grudges, and forgive old wrongs. And as faded traces of past glories crumble around them, children grow up.

Tales from the Low Cantrefs is a hearth fantasy coming-of-age roleplaying game built on the Apocalypse World engine. It is a game filled with petty village politics, childhood superstitions, adults who just don’t understand, strange magics, wild and ruined Landscapes, monsters out of old folktales, and the terrible responsibility of growing up. Its main themes are adolescence and self-acceptance, grief and sacrifice, and duty and responsibility, all against the backdrop of a slowly-gathering apocalypse. CW: The PCs are all children and adolescents, and children will be put in danger in this story.

**This is a series of 12 games of Tales from the Low Cantrefs Playtest on Thursday evenings September through November at 8PM Eastern US Time. Note that our final session is 11/18 and we will not be playing on American Thanksgiving.** Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. All-Access time is 7/16 at noon.

**THIS IS A PLAYTEST** IT may be wonky in places, and we may have to jury rig some stuff, but I&#39;m confident we will all have fun. In particular we are Feedback will be sent to the designer, Luke Jordan. In particular we will be testing out the long term play mechanics. We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), as well as Script Change. for safety tools.
