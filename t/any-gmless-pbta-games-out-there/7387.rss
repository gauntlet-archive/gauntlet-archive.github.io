    <title>Any GMless PbtA games out there?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/any-gmless-pbta-games-out-there/7387</link>
    <description>I have been contemplating taking the gmless route for my design and I was wondering if there are any games like that out there for inspiration.

Also, how would you go about it?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>By my money the two best GMless PbtA games are ones not using No Dice, No Masters framework.</p>
<p>These are Flotsam: Adrift Among the Stars (diceless, shares some of BOB themes but takes a more structured, scene calling based approach to GMless play) and Encounter Force! (far more akin to ND, NM but utilising more classicaly constructed moves within the freeplay, token-based framework).</p>
<p>Personally I’m a huge fan of Flotsam, as it clearly defines who controls what within a given scene (and this clarity is sth I value immensely and lack in freeform GMless games).</p>
