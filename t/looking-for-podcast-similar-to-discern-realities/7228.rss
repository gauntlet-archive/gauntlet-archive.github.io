    <description>Hi folks,

Looking for recommendations for podcasts structured like Discern Realities. Iâ€™ve given up hope that those final episodes mentioned in the last episode are ever going to roll out ðŸ˜­, and I really loved the format of some example play along with analysis â€” great help to a budding GM!</description>

              <p>Several of the other Gauntlet podcasts follow that format: discussion or analysis followed by actual play. Check out <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/1-forward" rel="nofollow noopener">Plus One Forward</a> for episodes focused on various PbtA games, and the <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/trophy-podcast" rel="nofollow noopener">Trophy podcast The Sixth Ring</a> for episodes about various topics related to the Trophy RPG. Both conclude with actual play segments.</p>
