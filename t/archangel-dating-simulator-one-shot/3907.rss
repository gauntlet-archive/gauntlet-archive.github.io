This session is scheduled for 3 hours. The session will be recorded if everyone is cool with it! If not, no worries. We will be using Streamyard.

***The divine hosts have incarnated. They’re also slightly not used to being so bodied and are slightly lost. They have this magnetic gravity and seem to be out of it. Would you so kindly, hmm. Date them?***

***You have karma to unravel! And boy is your penance looking bad/great/good. In a series of dates you will discover what divine love looks like on this earthly plane. What will your karmic dance look like? Can you stay together, or will fate drive you apart?***

[ ***ARCHANGEL DATING SIMULATOR*** ](https://mariabumby.itch.io/arch-angel-dating-simulator) ***is a story game that uses tarot cards as a intuitive tool for your creativity. All of us will weave a story of love (or heartbreak!) between two (or more!) people.***

Safety tools: We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
