    <description>On the blog today I go through my hack of the amazing *Free from the Yoke* to *Legend of the Five Ring*&#39;s Rokugan setting. I talk about some of the problematic aspects of the game, the mechanical changes made, and offer a complete character keeper for using this. We played eight sessions of this last year and really enjoyed it.
