    <title>1%er: The Outlaw Motorcyle Game (Three Mondays in September)</title>

    <description>**For the first 24 hours, please sign up only if you&#39;re new to the Gauntlet, or have had trouble getting into a series.**
**I&#39;ve waived the usual RSVP priority period.**

You and your brothers step out of the bar and see a band of rice jockey RUBs checking out your bikes. One of them has the nuts to wave at you like you’re pals or some shit. You all have to be at the Club ASAP to make a ride, but these posers really need to learn the ropes. Can you stomp their heads in and still make it to church on time?

1%er is a rules light, action packed role-playing game of outlaw bikers. You’ll spend games as a roving band of nomads, the best of the worst. Committing crime in order to support the local Chapter, trying to keep under the radar of the heat and your rivals, and still make time to transport some toys to the local children’s hospital.

Be cool, but when cool won’t cut it, be a fucking bad ass!

 Being able to make them all three sessions would be cool, but don&#39;t worry about it...
