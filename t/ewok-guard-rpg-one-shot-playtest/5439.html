          <p>Oh great spirits! A terrifying behemoth Gorax attacked distant and crucial Springrock Tree Village. Fortunately, your patrol is only a day away. You’ve chosen to travel there and bring whatever aid you can to the village until reinforcements can arrive within the week. Who knows what devastation or danger awaits? Fear not for we are the Guard!</p>
<p>WE ARE COURAGE IN THE HEART<br>
WE ARE FOCUS IN THE DEED<br>
WE ARE NATURE IN THE BREATH<br>
WE ARE WISDOM IN THE THOUGHT<br>
WE ARE THE GUARD<br>
EVERY VILLAGE HEAR OUR CALL<br>
WE ARE THE GUARD<br>
WE SERVE OUR PEOPLE STRONG<br>
WE ARE THE GUARD</p>
<p>We are Ewok—children of the Great Tree. We protect the Forest that lives between ground and sky. All of this is a sacred place we share with others, until the Skull Moon appeared above us. That is when the Night Spirit left our dreams to walk among us with fire and death. Since then, Ewoks from all villages have come together and vowed to fight as one guard against the Night Spirit and all who seek to harm the Forest.</p>
<p>This is a one-shot playtest of the Ewok Guard RPG, a tabletop RPG about defenders of the forest moon of Endor. Play a member of the courageous Ewok Guard. Help wayward visitors survive. Navigate challenging terrain on quests for villages. Survive internal division and politics. Fight dangerous predators far from home. Protect your people within the sacred Forest from the Night Spirit and prevent it’s ruthless Spawn from destroying all, including the Great Tree at the heart of the Forest.</p>
<p>This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.</p>
<p>There will be 1 session in total for this playtest.</p>
