    <description>**New players welcome! For the first 48 hours, please only sign up for this if you’re new to the Gauntlet (joined this year or haven’t played in a game on the calendar before). The usual priority access period has been waived for this game.** 

You are big. Big arms, big tits, big thighs, big brai—. You’re big where it matters. In addition to a heaving, throbbing body glistening lightly with a thin sheen of pleasantly fragrant perspirant, you have one singular unifying trait: come hell or high water, you are going to help. 

Please note: The word ‘himbo’ is gender neutral, as are its counterparts, bimbo and thembo. Players are encouraged to take on whatever title feels nice for their character regardless of external pressure to see these things as gendered.

Himbos of Myth and Mettle by Maxwell Lander is a high fantasy, high camp role playing game of epic proportions (of body), for 2-5 players. Himbos is inspired by many classic fantasy properties (and could be considered OSR adjacent), but leans towards a more garish, salacious and queer (gay or odd, pick your fighter) style of play.

Subject matter likely to include some violence, maybe romance and sex, and probably some objectification of your characters. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, romance preferences, the X card and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

Sessions will run over Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. I don’t intend to record these sessions.

Playing in both sessions is not required, but please sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend.

I’ll email players a week or so before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials. 

Session one: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-N6AE2raICsJqHwc4Gpe
Session two: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-N6AEE5o1-BAnNAaRuBd</description>
