              <p>I have recently read Brindlewood Bay and quite enjoyed it (despite it being a bit “thin” on the examples side, but there is definitely a limit on how much text you can put in a 40-page book).<br>
As I am planning on playing it with my group of fellow Italians, I would like to make a few changes to the “color”, with umarell instead of mavens, a fictional northern Italy town instead of Brindlewood Bay, and some non-occult conspiracy.<br>
I came here by googling the game and found out a few users are creating “carved from the brindlewood” games. Does that mean that BB is under some sort of an open licence? I am asking as I would like to post my hack online when finished and would love to know if this was possible and under which conditions.<br>
Many thanks to all who can provide insight.</p>

              <p>Thanks Jason. Just so I’m crystal clear, that means each player only has 12 total crown moves (7 Queen and 5 Void) to use across all of the 5 mysteries featured in the set?</p>
<p>It’s such a powerful resource, I completely understand why it needs to be limited or the session would be nothing but “What If’s?”</p>
<p>This will help emphasize with the players how valuable a commodity the Crown moves are.</p>

              <p>Hello! I’m planning to run Brindlewood Bay with a group of players as an alternative to our normal D&amp;D 5E sessions. They’re all very excited about creating their characters and playing something with much more roleplaying.</p>
<p>As I was reviewing the gameplay materials and prepping for our first session, I had a question about the Crown moves. Is there a limit on how many times the Crown moves can be used? With the Crown of the Void, the last use leads to the character’s “retirement,” so obviously there’s a built-in cap. But what about the Crown of the Queen move? Does the Crown of the Queen reset at the start of every session or every mystery?</p>
<p>Also, is there a limit on the number of items in a character’s “Cozy Little Place”? It seems like there could be a big disparity there if one player thinks of 20 plausible items and another only thinks of 5.</p>

              <p>Great question! When in doubt, Conditions. Have an NPC do or say something frustrating/insulting and then give the Maven a Condition based on it. Have the Maven bump her head while she’s poking around somewhere and then give her a “bumped noggin” Condition (or similar). For something a little more dangerous, have the lights go out and a shadowy figure threatens her in the darkness (although that might be better for a miss).</p>
<p>Glad you’re enjoying the game!</p>

              <p>I’ve run 5 sessions of Brindlewood Bay so far, and everyone is having a great time! The GBBBO mystery in particular has been a hit. One problem I’ve been having is coming up with good complications for 7-9 on a Meddling Move. My Mavens are often investigating by questioning people for information, or occasionally rummaging through rooms, and I have trouble coming up with a way to give them a “clue with a complication”. Does anyone have any good ideas?</p>

              <p>They don’t have to be, but one of the game’s major themes is that these women essentially started new lives in Brindlewood Bay. I think so long as that still comes through, you’re good.</p>

              <p>I’m about to run my first session, and wondering if there’s a reason it’s important for all the mavens to be widows? It seems like living exes would make for fun and interesting characters and fit the genre and tone well.</p>

              <p>Oh great! Let me know how it goes if you play it.</p>
<p>It was definitely intentional to only include male characters on the Maven Moves. The reason was mostly me being cheeky. The game very much centers the experience of playing an elderly woman, and spends a lot of time exploring the idea of these characters as women. I liked the idea of the big, macho detective man being subordinated to the role of a move on the character sheet.</p>
<p>All that said, I’m thinking there may be room for an expansion down the road that has Maven Moves with different themes. We’ll see…</p>

              <p>Finished reading it yesterday. It was great. I really like the tone and the vibe of the game. I will try to play it !</p>
<p>I really like how some mechanics are handled (Putting the crown and “rewinding” after a death scene).<br>
I plan to write a blog post about it (in french cause my blog is in french).</p>
<p>A question : is there a reason for the Maven Moves to include only “male TV characters” ?</p>

              <p>I am reading the game, definitelly I will run it at some time soon-ish.<br>
I really like how it bridges between PbtA mechanics and the game session skeleton of a FitD game. Also, I like that some of your ideas that I have heard in the podcasts are finally printed in a book that I can point to (CATS, Paint the Scene, etc.).<br>
I think that could be interesting to develop the idea of how to convert CoC, ToC adventures into BB scenarios.</p>
