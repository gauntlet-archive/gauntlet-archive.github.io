    <description>Apocalypse Wuxia 2e: Scorpion Strikes Toad

Saturdays in August at 1 pm CDT / 1900 GMT 

Opium smoke curls from the nostrils of a drunken fist master as she looks out at the brothel-dojang she runs while one of her students kicks a customer who got too handsy out the door. Motorcycles rev loudly to clear the street as the procession of hatchet gangsters take their daily tribute from the town. In the fields a youngster sees the future in the whorls of butterflies and loose blossoms. 

This is the Outlands.

The Outlands are a beautiful and luxe place, built upon gritty gilded carcasses of the world before mingled with new architecture honoring the strong, bold, and charismatic. This is a land of falling blossoms, dangerous martial secrets, and tenuous alliances between fractured warlords. A land where violence is poised ready to announce itself at the slightest provocation.

How will you change it?

Welcome to a special take on Apocalypse World 2e; this is a gun-bereft world where bullets are as costly and rare as the items which utilize them. Most everyone defends themselves with martial arts, melee weapons, along with other types of projectiles. This is a world highly inspired by Into the Badlands with lesser inspirations being Firefly+Serenity and Black Lagoon.

We will be in a beautiful apocalypse, a floral field we can paint with blood and drama. I want to get the ties of Apocalypse World, to make a place where we want to save the world and make it better even if we have to get our hands dirty to do so.

Certain Playbooks will be banned, the Gunlugger will be heavily altered for the setting, and there will be a few custom world moves. If you want to get your wuxia on in a world after a great war come to The Outlands!
