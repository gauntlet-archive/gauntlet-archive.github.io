    <description>Hey there,
I&#39;m currently planning an open table OSR game and am enthralled with the idea of giving the players (limited) control over a faction. 
I&#39;m looking for systems that I could lift/adapt for this.
I already know Godbound, ACK and Echo Resounding. Godbound is close to the level of complexity I am going for but seems a little too focused on high power shenanigans for my intended use. ACK and Echo are too fiddly. 
Do you know other systems that could work for this?</description>

              <p>I love <em>Blades in the Dark</em>! The smooth interaction between faction and fiction is one of the things I’d really love to port to OSR (I’m running <em>Whitehack</em>). It’s just easy to use the faction assets (mainly Cohorts and Experts in <em>Blades</em>) to accomplish things in the fiction without just handwaving them.<br>
I already own <em>REIGN</em> so maybe I have to take a third look <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p><em>REIGN: Enchiridion</em> has a really fascinating faction system that overlays rather nicely onto many traditional games. It’s simple, and designed to depend on player and player character activity rather than just working quietly off-screen.</p>
<p>Having said that—what are you looking to get out of systemizing this faction, rather than making it purely narrative?</p>

              <p>I’m not 100% sure (because I haven’t played the game), but <em>Remember Tomorrow</em> may have some interesting technology for you to steal. (It’s a GMless cyberpunk game with a bunch of factions making moves across the urban landscape.)</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Stars Without Number</em> has a faction system you may be able to exploit.</p>
<p>And, finally, <em>Blades in the Dark</em> should have some good stuff for you to borrow, as well!</p>
<p>I’d definitely take a look at those games, and pilfer some tools.</p>

              <p>I started playing around with a generic faction template to try to find what’s at the heart of a “faction” before mechanizing it. Once I got this far I started to wonder if it needs more mechanizing at all.</p>
