    <description>The Brindlewood Bay Writer&#39;s Workshop that was originally scheduled for February 28th has been rescheduled for **March 14th from 1PM - 4PM Eastern.**  We’ll be meeting via Zoom. The focus of this edition of the workshop will be “Advanced Mystery Writing and Campaign Structure.” Anyone can attend. 

This workshop will be structured like an open discussion. If you have a draft, I (Jason) will read and circulate it beforehand so long as you send it to me by March 7th. Drafts will only be circulated to other participants of the workshop.

If you’re interested in participating in the workshop, please send an email to [jason.cordova@hey.com](mailto:jason.cordova@hey.com), subject line: “Brindlewood Bay Workshop 3.” In your email, please include a short description of the game you are working on. You can use the same email to send me a draft of your mystery/campaign structure when you’re ready to circulate it among participants.</description>

              <p>We recorded the first two workshops, but not this one. The turnout was very small, so we decided to limit the conversation to very specific advice to the attendees as opposed to a structured conversation like the others.</p>
