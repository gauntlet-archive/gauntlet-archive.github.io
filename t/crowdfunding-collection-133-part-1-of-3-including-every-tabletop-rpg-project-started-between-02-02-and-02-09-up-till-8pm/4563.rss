    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/11/crowdfunding-collection-133-part-1-of-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #133 – Part 1 of 3, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/02 and 02/09 up till 8pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The collection is a bit delayed, because I am currently dealing with some personal stuff and because of the massive amount of projects – that’s 44 full games! Next to that, to make it a bit digestible, I split the collection into three parts:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/11/crowdfunding-collection-133-part-2-of-3-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #133 – Part 2 of 3 – Zine Quest&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/11/crowdfunding-collection-133-part-3-of-3-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #133 – Part 3 of 3 – Zine Quest&lt;/a&gt;

I’d like to start with the &lt;b&gt;Blacksad&lt;/b&gt; role-playing game by Nosolorol. They did release the original Spanish version of the game based on the popular comic series, and aim now to finance the English translation. For those who don’t know the comics, they offer a neo-noir setting in which anthropomorphic animals populate cities and a cat detective. The game uses a fast, simple d6 system and, well, I marked it. If you’d rather play humans, and would like to play people who go after the various supernatural plagues of urban cities, you should take a look at the second edition of &lt;b&gt;Hunter: The Vigil&lt;/b&gt;. The Chronicles of Darkness game enables you to play various tiers of hunters, from two wayward brothers up to whole organisations. Onyx Path Publishing is a very reliable creator and I do recommend it. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Deviant Evolution&lt;/b&gt;, which isn’t about the new deviants that Onyx Path will present. Instead it’s places its deviants in the future where they’ll have to venture out and explore. The game uses the Prometheus system, which can be previewed in a lite version on DTRPG.
Then there is &lt;b&gt;Altered Carbon&lt;/b&gt; by Hunters Books. The cyberpunk game is based on the Netflix and book series by the same name. People can switch their bodies (sleeved) as they like, or rather as they can afford. The setting is very cool – I liked the show – and the system doesn’t seem to be to bad. Plus, the publisher will be creating the 5th edition of Werewolf the Apocalypse. Which puts me from „interested“ to „backer“ – take look. &lt;b&gt;Omega Horizon&lt;/b&gt; is another take on the cyberpunk genre, which adds piloted mechs. I like the idea, the system sound solid enough, though I couldn’t spare the cash.
A project I do honestly love and champion hard is &lt;b&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade – CHAPTERS&lt;/b&gt;. The game is a mixture of a roleplaying game and dungeon crawler boardgame with way more social aspects. Basically a „gamebook boardgame“. I met it at SPIEL 2019 and loved it so much that I started supporting it on the spot. The game mechanics are simple, accessible and fun. I usually don’t give a rats ass about miniatures, but the 40mm ones are very beautiful. The game material, alas only preview one, was very cool. If you want to try it yourself, check out the two free online preludes on TableTopia – they showcase the basic mechanics. Then there are lot of miniatures – Vampires! Werewolf! Ananasi (Werspider)! Bloodlines 2 character and many more -, coins, dice bags and not to expansive V5 metal dice (15 dice for ~38$).
I am in, twice! Check it out!
There are cool other ttrpg related projctes to. For example the &lt;b&gt;Decuma&lt;/b&gt; deck of cards. Which offer really nice cards to R&amp;D settings and campaigns. I couldn’t resist. Though I did manage my willpower roll on &lt;b&gt;Coins of the Tarot&lt;/b&gt;. The coins look cool, but my budget says „nope“. There are cool dice projects like &lt;b&gt;The vintage bone dice&lt;/b&gt; and if you like PFRPG you might like to checkout the video game &lt;b&gt;Wrath of the Righteous&lt;/b&gt;. There is a nice Spanish notebook with Cuadernos &amp; Dungeons and the French game Aria looks very, very cool.
You find these and many more cool projects here:
