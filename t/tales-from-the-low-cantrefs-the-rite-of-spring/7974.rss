This is a run of Tales from the Low Cantrefs, a game currently in development by [Luke Jordan ](https://twitter.com/wildwoodsgames). This game is currently in playtest and does not yet represent the full game, but there is a solid basis for the game in place. It is a fantasy coming-of-age game with young protagonists. Sessions will be three hours in length. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (March 28th). This game will be played using the open table policy, though I would recommend only signing up if you can make all sessions as I think it will lead to a better play experience. One session in May is very likely to be cancelled as I&#39;m likely to be away, but not sure exactly when yet, which is why I&#39;ve begun on the last week in April. We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

&lt;em&gt;Never travel alone. Never travel after dark. Whistle for the wind to save you. Light candles in every window. Bury iron under the threshold. Hang rowan, elder, and hazel over your bed. Flee mist, and seek running water.
Mostly the folk ways work. Sometimes they don’t, and when they don’t the bodies are rarely found.Truthfully, few care to look too hard.
But nonetheless, in the midst of this, life goes on. Fields are planted. Cottages are built, and roofs thatched. Namedays and baptisms are celebrated, and the harvest welcomed in. Babies are born. People fall in love, make new friends, cling to grudges, and forgive old wrongs.
And as faded traces of past glories crumble around them, children grow up.&lt;/em&gt;
Tales from the Low Cantrefs is a hearth fantasy coming-of-age roleplaying game built on the ApocalypseWorld engine. It is a game filled with petty village politics, childhood superstitions, adults who just don’t understand, strange magics, wild and ruined landscapes,monsters out of old folktales, and the terrible responsibility of growing up.
You will play young people with the potential to grow into heroes. Fresh growth is coming into full bloom in the Springtime sun, and the same drive stirs within you. The adults may follow the old ways, but they do not truly  *believe*  - and it is up to you to face whatever peril threatens the village.

Content Warnings: This game is about adolescent children in a fantasy world, dealing with very real dangers. There will be elements of folk horror and likely interaction with the land of the dead/undeath. There is a real threat of violence, though usually as a last resort, and by the very nature of the game there will be endangerment of children. If this element in particular is something you are not happy with, I would advise avoiding this game. Though in general content should be nothing that wouldn’t be at home in young adult fiction. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
