<p>A hundred years ago, Toren’s Bend was ruled by the usurper Lord Gahldren. Gahldren was a heretic, and routinely defied the teachings of the Sisters. The people rose up and overthrew him, burning down his keep and murdering his soldiers. A curse fell upon the land, and the town withered away. What treasure remains there? And what remains of the supposed curse?</p>
<p>Trophy Gold is Jesse Ross’s dark fantasy game about desperate treasure hunters risking mind and body against terrible odds. In this series I hope to run a couple of incursions - Hester’s Mill by Jason Cordova and Top Of The World by Jim Crocker - with some hearthfire downtime in between, but will depend how fast the group goes how much material we cover.</p>
<p>No rules knowledge is required, all rules will be taught during play.</p>
<p>Subject matter: Trophy Gold includes violence and horror elements, including body horror. Hester’s Mill includes references to cannibalism and human and animal sacrifice. We will use the X Card, Lines and Veils and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Feel free to sign up for as many or few sessions as you’d like, but please sign up for all the sessions you’d like to play in.</p>
<p>We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. The sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players.</p>
<p>Open access time for sign-ups is 8.30am 28th April AEST.</p>
