    <title>The True-Gold Forge</title>

    <description>I&#39;m writing a little tool that is an expansion of Jason C&#39;s Perilous Journey procedure . Jason&#39;s thing is really great - but over an extended campaign you might want more questions and prompts to draw on! The original procedure is intended for use with Dungeon World - but the questions are system agnostic, and could easily slot into most fantasy genre games. 

It will also attempt to slow low the pace down around the campfire, and zoom in on the characters relationships with one another, their history and the world they live in. A grab bag of questions and prompts. These might take place across multiple nights/quiet moments on a journey and could serve to help mark the passage of time.

Here&#39;s a little flavour poem - will share some more reeeall soon! L

        Bonds of True-Gold can not be fully forged
        within the intense heat and pressure of perilous journeys.
        They require stolen moments in lonely havens.
        They are tempered by hushed words over broken bread,
        quenched in the soft light of The True-Gold Forge,
        beset by the dark.</description>

              <p>I really like the idea of a grab bag of questions to draw from for perilous journey. Perilous journey, and other moves like it (Stonetop has a great one!) are some of my favorite moments in adventure fantasy. I like the zoom out.</p>
