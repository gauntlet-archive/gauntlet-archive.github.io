    <description>Hello everyone! I&#39;m not posting here often but never a better day to change that than today! 

I wrote a small GMLess game this morning; Bigone Embers. It deals with characters been dead and reliving the key moments of their lives as they journey deeper into the underworld, and I&#39;d love some feedback on it! 

[Bigone Embers v0.5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10HBX8bSebxhvtXBO_1rMXs8-SIwIJGyeKhnJK_IULL4/edit?usp=sharing)

Thank you all for your thoughts and time. :heart:</description>

              <p>Are there any specific things you want people to look into and give you feedback on? Are there other games you would say are similar such that if someone liked one of those other games they might like this one?</p>
