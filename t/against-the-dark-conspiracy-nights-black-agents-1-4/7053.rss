    <description>In this off-calendar follow-up to Lowell Francis&#39; NBA Express campaign, Jimmy Rook the former Criminal and deniable MI6 Burglar returns as part of a new team comprising Lena Karppi, a Handler with the Finnish NBI until her partner went missing;  Vlad Rostov who used to do SIGINT for the GRU until the Conspiracy betrayed him and he ran; and Eun-Jung Rhee an ex-NSA Assassin who had a close encounter with &#39;something&#39; in Austria that tested her faith. We open in the Jordanian desert overlooking the Dead Sea where the team are set to rescue a missing asset. There&#39;s goats, a box, a big bang, and a surprise, before they head to Amman in pursuit of a suspicious business woman. Then ... a corporate villa, a shadow that moves, and slaughter ... before an escape and an interesting offer ...

              <p><strong>Against the Dark Cnspiracy - Night’s Black Agents (4/4)</strong><br>
Vlad the former GRU Sparks is smuggled into Russia while Eun-Jung, the other Operator on an FSB watch-list due to her wetwork for the US, invests in a solid cover. They meet Lena the ex-Finnish police Handler and Jimmy, the Burglar intimately bound up with MI6 in Moscow, to find ‘Site A’ before the Conspiracy does. There’s an offer to ‘come in from the cold’ and a a séance, while the suspicious activity of GRU pawns of the Conspiracy leads to a retired doctor with a dark Soviet past, . Then … a kidnapped innocent, a car chase, and a water park where a vampire’s scheme is revealed …</p>

              <p><strong>Against the dark Conspiracy - Night’s Black Agents (3/4)</strong><br>
After successfully rescuing Torvald Kane from a real kidnap Lena the Handler sources a most unlikely disguise, Jimmy the Burglar encourages the team to source a fresh cache of heavy weapons so they can ‘go in HARD’, while Vlad the Sparks worries about his sister Svietlana. While everyone grabs up equipment in the closing window before AgraWealth realise their kidnap has failed, Eun-Jung seeks solace in confession and takes a penance into action. There’s a helicopter crash, a John Woo confrontation, a cache of papers and a light armoured vehicle … then a member of the Afrika Korps, an old enemy, and a summoning … and an explosion … obvs!</p>

              <p><strong>Against the Dark Conspiracy (2/4)</strong><br>
Lena the former Handler gets a job at a 7-star hotel so she can provide cover when Jimmy the former Criminal get in on the discrete ‘Night Limo’ that delivers ‘anything’ to the rear entrance. Meanwhile, Vlad the Sparks hacks a phoneline after a useful bribe is paid and Eun-Jung the Assassin damages some infrastructure just enough to ensure the hotel needs urgent technical help. There’s a suite full of bodies, a bomb and a re-purposed automated window cleaner … then a wheelchair, a paraglider decorated with the Finnish flag, and a helicopter going over the edge of a roof … and David Beckham’s super-yacht …</p>
