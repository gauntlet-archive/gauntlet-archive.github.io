    <description>**The once-wonderful Space Republic teeters on the verge of collapse! The (democratically elected) Space Queen, Rose Nebula, struggles with countless challenges throughout the realm! Can you, her trusted Space Blades, overcome her rivals&#39; wiles, right terrible wrongs, and usher in a new golden age?**

**Cross swords and fall in love with  *Thirsty Sword Lesbians* , a tabletop roleplaying game by April Kit Walsh.**

**No previous knowledge of the system is required!**

The  *Thirsty Sword Lesbians RPG*  celebrates queer love and power. The game uses a lightweight, easy-to-learn system to focus the story on your characters&#39; feelings, angst, and relationships. Player safety and consent are built in to the mechanics so you can dive into the messy world of flirtatious swordfighting with confidence.

By default your characters are some type of lesbian, but you can play characters of any pronoun, gender, or sexuality. You are strongly encouraged to make your characters queer.

You must RSVP for every session you wish to attend. I&#39;d prefer if you could attend each session but this is not a requirement.

The sessions may be recorded and posted if all are okay with this. [The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
