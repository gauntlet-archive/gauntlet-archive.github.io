    <description>Hi, I&#39;m wondering  how people handle online games where not everyone has &quot;the book&quot;. Some games have an SRD, or have everything on a shareable character sheet, but I&#39;m wondering what you do for games that don&#39;t. 

Do you write up your own summary? Can you share the book without allowing it to be downloaded by the third party?</description>

              <p>I’m with Sandy on this one. I think sharing a PDF for the purpose of conducting a game is fine. I also lend my PDFs to other players, e.g. to create a character. I expect them to delete the copy when there is no longer any need to keep it or buy their own copy.</p>

              <p>To me, it depends on the game.</p>
<p>If a game really requires everyone to have a copy - I’m thinking of Firebrands games, for example - I’ll share the pdf with the players and explicitly say “you’ll need this text to play, but if you enjoy the game, I encourage you to support the designer by buying a copy”, with a link to the page where they can do so. I consider this a normal and as-intended use of the game text, and don’t have any reservations about sharing in this way.</p>
<p>If there are specific parts of the text players need, but not the whole thing, I’ll print those parts to pdf and share them in a google drive. For example, I often do this for skill descriptions in games like Fate or Gumshoe.</p>
<p>If the players don’t need the text at all, then I’ll just aim to explain things verbally. I play a lot of pbta games were everything the players need is on their playbook or the reference sheet, for example.</p>

              <p>For online play, I generally have a cheat sheet (a lot of games have their own, some character keepers have them, or I’ll make one) which I keep in a Google Drive folder for the campaign.<br>
During Session Zero I’ll generally do ‘the teach’ and run through the rules using Jamboard or pages on Roll20, to get some of the core ideas across.</p>

              <p>I just share the rulebook with the other players at the table, if they ask for it or we feel it could be useful for the game.<br>

<p>The only occasion in which I would write a summary instead, is if the original rulebook is so badly written or organised, that a summary would make the game experience better than relying on the original text.<br>
(uncommon, but it has been known to happen)</p>
<p>In the privacy of your home table, you do you. In my opinion <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I prefer to write up the core rules onto tabs of a character keeper. I’m uncomfortable about sharing an entire pdf and to be honest I’m not certain players need it. For quite gritty games where you feel the work to create a summary is too much I’d think about sharing copies of the reference sheets most games worth their salt come with.</p>
