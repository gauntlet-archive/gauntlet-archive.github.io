My game For the Dungeon! is in its last few days on Kickstarter and wanted to share it with all of you. It&#39;s a game about playing the minions instead of the heroes.

Here are few fun things about the game. It&#39;s based on the principles of improv comedy. Critical failures are one of the most fun parts of the game. You get to play the bad guys; who doesn&#39;t want to be a kobold, mimic, or skeleton. Only $8 digital or $16 for the paperback.

If you want to know more I did an interview with the +1 Forward podcast this site sponsors. You can find it here: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/1-forward/for-the-dungeon

Or you can check out the Kickstarter here: https://bit.ly/forthedungeon There are only a few short days left to back so get in on this action while you still can. If you have any questions I&#39;m happy to talk about anything, let&#39;s connect!</description>
