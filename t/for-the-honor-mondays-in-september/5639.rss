    <title>For the Honor - Mondays in September</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/for-the-honor-mondays-in-september/5639</link>
    <description>All access time for this series is [date=2020-07-27 time=16:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;].

&gt; The princesses of Athera are faced with a daunting task. The Legion&#39;s forces have encroached farther than ever before into the Tangled Woods, the magic that infuses everything in Athera is beginning to wane, and the kingdoms are sending out dance invitations! These tasks cannot be accomplished alone, but with our friends we can accomplish anything.

For the Honor is a Firebrands game of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power with the serial numbers lightly filed off. In this GMless story game, we will take on the roles of the princesses, knights, and adventurers of the planet Athera and explore the magical and ever-changing world, the violent factions that would tear it apart, and the love we have for each other.

This is a three session run for four total players. Feel free to drop in/out of this game as you need. The game will be played over Zoom and will be recorded/shared online with player permission.

## Safety Tools

We will be using script change, x-card, lines and veils, and an open door policy. All of these tools will be explained at the start of the session. This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
