          <p>So this is kind of a weird topic, but‚Ä¶ For a long time I‚Äôve been seeing how <em>Blades in the Dark,</em> and then <em>Forged in the Dark,</em> have really been taking off in the PbtA-adjacent, indie gaming world. There have been a number of hacks and new games coming out that look <em>really</em> interesting! <em>Song for the Dusk, Scum and Villainy, Blades Against Darkness, A Nocturne, Hack the Planet, Band of Blades, Beam Saber,</em> etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve enjoyed checking all these out, especially the really evocative settings that most of them come with, buuuut‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Having played a few times, and watched/listened to a number of actual plays, I still just can‚Äôt get into the system‚Ä¶ In theory, I enjoy how there‚Äôs generally a little more going on than in your average PbtA game: deeper avenues for advancement, lots of currencies to manage, etc. But, there‚Äôs a number of things that I just constantly bounce off of.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll try to refrain from writing out a whole exhaustive list, but in brief, the big things that come to mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can‚Äôt ever quite get my head around Position/Effect. It feels like it can really slow the game down to declare/negotiate these every move, and I never feel like I have a solid sense of what different levels of effect are supposed to look like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default harshness of the system also puts me off. If you take harm, it‚Äôs pretty difficult to ever get rid of. Stress seems designed to build up on you over time no matter how much you keep it down. PC mortality seems high, because the crew is the only real lasting character. Doing jobs against higher tier factions puts you at near-constant limited effect, etc. I guess this is a personal taste thing at the end of the day‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve thought about how you could house-rule some of these things, but at what point does modifying rules for a game start to feel like ‚Äújust play something else‚Ä¶?‚Äù</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I absolutely don‚Äôt mean this to be a post dragging FitD. When I look at it from a more detached design standpoint, it‚Äôs a really brilliant system. I think it‚Äôs a great example of every mechanic and currency tying in really tightly with one another, and so much has been written already about the great setting in <em>Blades</em>. It‚Äôs just that for me, it‚Äôs still not clicking. But I really <em>want</em> it to click!</p>
<p>TLDR; what advice do people have for me to find a way to really <em>get</em> Blades/FitD? Is there a good mentality to adopt that might make it work for me? I guess at some point it becomes a matter of ‚Äúit‚Äôs just not for you,‚Äù but I‚Äôm still at the stage of hoping that‚Äôs not the case. How do you suggest easing into it? Are there home rules people have used to make it work for them?</p>
<p>Edit: On top of that, feel free to tell me what you really like about Blades/FitD! I‚Äôd love to hear what people are enthusiastic about with this system! Maybe it‚Äôd help to hear what about it makes people really excited!</p>

          <p>If you approach position/effect from a negotiation/haggling perspective, they will never be clear cut enough.  If you use them to establish shared norms about the context of actions, they start to flow smoothly quite quickly.  I think they make explicit a thing that is implicit in most systems.</p>
<p>Harm doesn‚Äôt take that long to recover if you‚Äôre willing to focus several character‚Äôs downtime on it, and stress can soak a lot of potential harm.  Taking traumas is a non-penalizing consequence of going over stress, so you can push too hard without much consequence.</p>
<p>Maybe run shorter scores and make sure you‚Äôre getting enough coin for them?  The longer the score, the more stress you‚Äôll take avoiding consequences.  The more coin you make, the more downtime actions you get to recover and prep.</p>
<p>I actually rarely see Blades characters die (unless the player leans into that).  Are there actual play series you‚Äôve watched with a lot of character deaths?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, feel free to tell me what you really like about Blades/FitD!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What a love about Blades is the tools for truly player-driven campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Options with context:</strong> Crews have a claims sheet. If they want their own safe, or drug den, or luxury fence, then they can pursue a score for that thing (with clear mechanical benefits). I think this results in much more sandbox-style play than waiting for a job through an NPC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connections to relationships:</strong> Crews can choose to target the turf of a specific faction. Because all the factions are intertwined, PCs could look up who their allied factions consider enemies and try to tie a score into their alliance-building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A sense of place:</strong> PCs have a base of operations and will likely interact a lot with the other factions in their home district. Taking a job in a new district is likely to introduce them to new factions and NPCs. And it can be interesting for a scruffy Crows Foot gang to take a job in the wealthy mansions of Brighthollow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ways to gather information before committing to an adventure</strong>: PCs can start projects in their downtime to search for an unusual score or unknown faction. If players are interested in something, but it‚Äôs not an immediate option, they can spend resources to make it happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear risk/ reward:</strong> Crews can go after a faction of a higher tier than they are, for more rep and likely a greater payout. However, that faction will have better guards, better gear, and better security measures. Given the transparency of the tier system, PCs can make informed decisions about when to try to punch above their weight class.</p>
</li>
</ul>

          <p>For what it‚Äôs worth, it‚Äôs BARELY a houserule to just say ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, I‚Äôm not interested in this game being brutal, so tier is not a factor in effect.‚Äù  and that pretty much entirely takes care of your second issue ‚Äì this is how my Blades game ran for a long time.  Be advised that it makes the PCs pretty dangerous, but it definitely works.</p>
<p>I also definitely disagree that character mortality is high.  It‚Äôs really not hard at all to get rid of Harm in Blades, you just need to spend some money on it.  The only way a character really gets taken out of play is via Trauma, and you need a LOT of Trauma for that to happen.</p>
<p>Actually, have you read Blades in the Dark? It does a lot of talking about how to set these sorts of parameters for your game.  That‚Äôs actually one of the things I really like about it ‚Äì it‚Äôs really easy to tune the game to get the feel you are looking for.</p>
<p>Otherwise? I like it because of The Crew and the way it persists outside of any given character and because it‚Äôs got a pleasant middle ground between ‚Äúrules light‚Äù and ‚Äúoh god the rules, the rules!‚Äù  My player who really is into mechanical ‚Äústuff‚Äù can sink his teeth into it, but my players who prefer drama and roleplay also have good support.</p>

</aside>
<p>So for me, I NEED reference sheets for games. I love it when they come provided‚Ä¶ but sometimes I actually get more out of them if I make them myself. <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/paul_beakley">@Paul_Beakley</a>  made a <a href="https://www.indiegamereadingclub.com/indie-game-reading-club/band-of-blades-position-effect-cheat-sheet/" rel="nofollow noopener">position/effect chart for Band of Blades</a>. It‚Äôs not exactly the same as Blades in the Dark, but it‚Äôs a good starting off point. I would strongly suggest making one for the FitD game you want to play.</p>
<p>But yes, I do think the negotiation for Position/Effect can slow things down, I have found that with system mastery it definitely speeds up. Getting shared understanding of what a desperate situation is and what great effect are will definitely help. But depending on the specific game and tone, you‚Äôll find these things shift.</p>
<p>One thing to remember is that you can resist a ton of consequences. But this resistance might vary drastically from system to system. In Blades in the Dark you might be able to shift a level 3 harm down 2 levels to be a level 1 harm and use armor to negate the last bit. Scum and Villainy you might be able to resist the level 3 harm. In Band of Blades you might only be able to resist it down 1 level  to level 2, then with armor push it down to level 1 harm. What and how much you can resist, to me, affects the tone of the game just as much as how big an effect ‚Äúgreat‚Äù effect is.</p>
<p>[One side note remember you can NOT resist the effect from a devils bargain, those things happen and you can‚Äô t resist it]</p>
<p>One thing I‚Äôve seen that makes FitD seem more harsh, is that folks generally don‚Äôt want to ‚Äústress out and get a trauma‚Äù and instead will take a harm level. Go the other way, TOTALLY stress out and take a trauma and avoid and minimize harm levels as much as possible. The first trauma (and even subsequent ones) can be a source of XP, and can make your character more interesting or fun to play‚Ä¶ or you can pretty much ignore it too. Harm levels are rough, and really take some focus and dedication to fix, or to have you have multiple characters to let them rest up and recover between sessions.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôm a little perplexed by the idea of position/effect being something you need to achieve system mastery to avoid spending a lot of time on.  Position and effect is super easy:</p>
<p>Unless for some reason the GM thinks this is extra dangerous/extra safe, or that for some reason you‚Äôre likely to be extra effective or very ineffective, it‚Äôs Risky/Standard.  If the GM doesn‚Äôt say anything, it‚Äôs Risky/Standard.  If the GM forgets, it‚Äôs Risky/Standard.  The game works fine that way.   Every once in while you‚Äôll still get a situation where it‚Äôs OBVIOUSLY not Risky ‚Äì either because of Consequences or an Engagement roll pinning things at Desperate, or because someone else took a Setup action to move things up to controlled, or whatever.  In those cases, it‚Äôs whatever is obvious.  You‚Äôre basically already trained to do this ‚Äì think of your position as the ‚Äútarget number‚Äù if you want.  You‚Äôve been doing that forever, most likely, and no one ever talks about how long it takes to set those, even though they‚Äôre way more complex than Position/Effect.</p>
<p>Effect is almost always standard unless there‚Äôs a mechanical modifier on board ‚Äì Fine equipment? Okay, Improved Effect.  Is it a Demon, and you‚Äôre just trying to stab it? Okay, Reduced Effect.  But mostly? Standard.  Heck, a lot of the time effect doesn‚Äôt even matter ‚Äì either you do the thing or you don‚Äôt, and improved effect doesn‚Äôt really help.  I find that effect is most relevant when dealing with something that has a Clock.</p>
<p>Oh, and that‚Äôs another thing that‚Äôs configurable: How effective Resistance is.  Does a Resistance roll just reduce consequences? Or does it avoid them altogether? This is another thing that Blades talks about and gives guidelines for.</p>

<p>it‚Äôs got a pleasant middle ground between ‚Äúrules light‚Äù and ‚Äúoh god the rules, the rules!‚Äù My player who really is into mechanical ‚Äústuff‚Äù can sink his teeth into it, but my players who prefer drama and roleplay also have good support.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like this a lot too, I think it‚Äôs one of the big things that keeps me trying to come back to it even when I struggle to really get it. As much as I‚Äôm a self-proclaimed PbtA nut, I‚Äôd be very interested in a similar system that does a little ‚Äúmore.‚Äù</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/michael">@Michael</a> About mortality, I don‚Äôt actually think I‚Äôve seen a character straight up die, so fair enough on that front. I do get the impression that harm, like stress/trauma, tends to build up over time no matter what, so I guess it was more the assumption that it would have to overcome someone eventually. I understand harm can be brought down with downtime activities, but if I remember the math on that, it‚Äôs something that probably takes multiple downtimes to fill the healing clock (so you‚Äôre carrying that harm over for a job or two), and the clock resets if you get hurt again before it‚Äôs finished. And with baseline two downtime activities, you‚Äôre probably destressing, healing, and that‚Äôs it for you that round. When I played we didn‚Äôt have much money so paying to top healing off or do more activities didn‚Äôt seem like a valid option, but maybe that becomes less of an issue over time.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/yoshi">@yoshi</a> Being much more willing to spend stress and even take traumas than take harm is good advice for that! The idea of a character ‚Äútrauma-ing out‚Äù does bother me a little bit too, but maybe this is another thing that really just doesn‚Äôt happen fast enough to be an issue in most games?</p>
<p>I have read the book and seen that it suggests that most of these aspects are things you can tune for your own game, but that‚Äôs almost part of what makes me uncomfortable with it? Part of me likes how much you can make the system work just right for your game, but it also makes me feel like if you don‚Äôt have that ‚Äòsystem mastery‚Äô, or at least decent comfort level, you‚Äôre kind of twisting in the wind a bit on what the ‚Äòright‚Äô balance for these things is.</p>
<p>It may become a moot point as I get more comfortable with the system, but at least when I‚Äôm newly coming to it, it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôd feel a lot more ‚Äòstable‚Äô with if there were clear inputs and outputs, like ‚Äúthings have X HP, an attack like this does Y harm,‚Äù etc. Again, not to say that this makes it a <em>bad</em> system or that it doesn‚Äôt work well, but that‚Äôs my discomfort with it.</p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs a similar issue with position/effect feeling daunting. I understand that it‚Äôs basically making <em>explicit</em> something that is <em>implicit</em> in most game design (even my beloved PbtA), but, well‚Ä¶ in those games, it‚Äôs just that, implicit. It‚Äôs something that goes unspoken. By bringing it forward as an active consideration, it starts to become a ‚Äúwellllll is this factor an issue? Is THIS factor an issue?? Is it REALLY standard?? It‚Äôs <em>kind of</em> a different situation than the last time we had a standard effect, so‚Äì!‚Äù It all feels so‚Ä¶ nebulous?</p>
<p>And I mean I really do get what you‚Äôre all saying about just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt worry so much about it‚Ä¶ and just assuming risky/standard unless it really needs to be something else. That is good advice and I‚Äôll try to keep it in mind =P<br>
But that‚Äôs where my mind tends to go when looking at the position/effect system.</p>

          <p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/airk">@Airk</a>‚Äôs point that you can assume Standard/Risky positioning until prompted to shift it.</p>
<p>Regarding having the Coin to recover, I love that the rules say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GM, definitely don‚Äôt screw around with the players when it comes to the payoff. Don‚Äôt say that the client lied and there‚Äôs no reward. Or that the meeting for the payment is actually a trap, or whatever. These types of things are staples of crime fiction, but in  <em>Blades</em> , the PCs have enough problems coming at them from every direction already. When it comes to getting paid, just give them what they earned.</p>

<p>what advice do people have for me to find a way to really <em>get</em> Blades/FitD?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In most FitD games, you play criminals. Safe, comfy criminals aren‚Äôt interesting, so if you‚Äôre playing safe and comfy ‚Ä¶ the game‚Äôs not going to be interesting. Manage risks the way a criminal would: Play for the short term motivations, and you will find the game has your back.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs something clever going on under the surface of FitD in that it creates an <em>illusion</em> of danger to boost the tension of scenes. Stress/trauma is a highly manageable, slowly accumulating meter that actually accelerates your ability growth. It‚Äôs designed to look and feel far more threatening than it actually is. You‚Äôre a third of the way there in understanding that the narrative is not dependent on individual characters, but seeing through the veil on the stress meter is the big thing.</p>

<p>Also most of the time it‚Äôs Risky Position and Standard Effect.  In the book they say you can just play it that way when you first start.  As you get experience you‚Äôll get a feel for when it‚Äôs Desperate or when you‚Äôll have Limited effect.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm so glad that someone did say this though, because I‚Äôve worried that this might be me, and it kinda makes me feel like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù and that‚Äôs pretty silly.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve read <em>Blades</em> as well as <em>Scum &amp; Villainy</em> and listened to some actual plays, and while I think I would love to <em>play</em> a FitD game, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to run one, because it does just seem like too much for me to keep track of. I stopped running D&amp;D because of the cognitive load, and found that PbtA stuff really tends to be about perfect for me in terms of what I can handle and do well with. It scares me that FitD stuff seems comparatively so <em>fiddly</em>‚Äìmaybe not as much as D&amp;D, and certainly not as much as, say, Shadowrun or whatever, but it still seems like <em>an awful lot to keep track of</em>.</p>

          <p>In my admittedly limited experience (playing some Blades on a forum and running a few ftf sessions of S&amp;V), I think the load is lower on the GM than on the players.</p>
<p>The players have to manage and keep track of their stress, harm, equipment, coin, projects, heat, turf/ship/etc, and abilities, on top of the regular gameplay where you‚Äôre scrambling for dice and trying to be smart about fictional positioning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GM can focus almost entirely on the fiction. You set position and effect when the players want to do something, declare comsequences, and set up clocks and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about it, mechanically. You do a lot of translating the fiction into mechanics, but like with position/effect there is typically a very limited number of boxes to put things into.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jimlikesgames">@jimlikesgames</a> I‚Äôd love to hear more about what you find cognitively difficult about Blades.  My experience with it is that it‚Äôs pretty light to run, and that you can build up complexity over time, so that it never quite gets overwhelming.  The thing I have the hardest time with is the faction game, and keeping the world constantly moving and living in the background.  There was definitely a learning curve with setting position and effect, but since that‚Äôs a negotiation with my players, it felt very much like a shared burden we were carrying together, and we ultimately found our balance.</p>

          <p>Hmm. Again, to haven‚Äôt run or played it yet, so maybe it just seems worse to me than it really is?</p>
<p>That said, I do think we should remember that different aspects of running (or playing) a game are carried differently by different people. What feels easy and well-supported to one may take up too much bandwidth for another. I guess I just want to make sure we are all taking that into consideration. A couple of comments in this thread do seem to be on the borderline as far as that goes.</p>
