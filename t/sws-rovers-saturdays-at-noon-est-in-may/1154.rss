-------------------------------------
It’s a big galaxy all right, but most folks are content to sit in the mud at the bottom of a gravity well, selling each other widgets and busted dreams. But we’re out there, making a living with our wits, fists, and guts, looking for the next system and the big score. They call us pirates, mercenaries or worse, but we call ourselves Rovers and the galaxy is ours for the taking. As long as the Empire doesn’t catch up with us…

Rovers is a WoDu hack from Cat Ramen!

-------------------------------------
This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi), when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.
