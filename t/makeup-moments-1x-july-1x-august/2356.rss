This is for two sessions of Makeup Moments, a live action online game (laog), available in Codex Glamour 2. You play people who go out together and put make-up on for that purpose. 

Both sessions are completely independent. You can sign up for both if you want. 

![Makeup%20Moments%20Cover|380x500,50%](upload://x3I0kT6Qv4b43IzxHFOzryC5sqv.jpeg) 
To play this game, you a players **will actually put make-up on**. So you need some mascara, lipstick, rouge etc. and possibly material to remove the make-up afterwards. 

Being a laog, this means players play in front of a video camera, connected through a video call and that we stay for the time of the play in-character and even impersonate our characters with our full bodies. This mostly means using mimics, facial expressions and voice. 

No experience with make-up necessary. Although you will make it an effort to do some great make-up, **this is not about perfection** and nobody will judge you on your skills. 

**This game is about celebrating each other for their ideas and who they are.**


Feel free to get in touch with me on the Gauntlet Forums or Slack if you have any questions. 

This event will be recorded and published on my Youtube channel if no objections after the recording are made but I would appreciate if we could publish the session. [The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html)  will be in play and safety tools will be explained and practiced before we start actual play.
