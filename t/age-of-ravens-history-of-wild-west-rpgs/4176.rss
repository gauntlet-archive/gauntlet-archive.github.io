Over on the Gauntlet Blog, I look at the history of &quot;Wild West&quot; rpgs, a problematic genre that like D&amp;D emerged directly out of miniatures wargaming. While the genre&#39;s gotten somewhat better in recent years (The new *Zorro* rpg, *Haunted West*) there&#39;s still some cringey stuff out there. This is part of my re-visit to my History of RPG Genres lists.

              <p>If there are any questions about the Swedish Western RPG I have the new fourth edition and at least one of the older ones. Second, probably, but I haven’t looked at it in years.</p>
<p>As for Avalon Hill’s Gunslinger, I played that a couple of times back in the day. It was my grail game for a long time and I finally tracked down a copy a few years back. It’s not actually that complicated to play - it’s bascially a programmed movement system with cards as randomizers - but like many Avalon Hill games of that era it has rules that don’t follow well established patterns and usually doesn’t bother explaining why the rules are written a particular way. Also the scenarios don’t even try to be balanced which makes it a very particular experience. IIRC it also has a campaign system that makes it a kinda-sorta-but-not-really RPG.</p>

Over on the Gauntlet Blog, I look at the history of “Wild West” rpgs, a problematic genre that like D&amp;D emerged directly out of miniatures wargaming. While the genre’s gotten somewhat better in recent years (The new <em>Zorro</em> rpg, <em>Haunted West</em>) there’s still some cringey stuff out there.

<p>I originally wrote this list back in early 2016. The Wild West rpg remains an oddity-- trying to figure out a balance between "realism" and pop media depictions. It's also potentially a deeply flawed...</p>
