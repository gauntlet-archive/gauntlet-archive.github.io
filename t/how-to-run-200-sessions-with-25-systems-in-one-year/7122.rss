              <p>There are a couple of online rollers. I use Roll With Me by <a class="mention" href="/u/jonjongrim">@jonjongrim</a>. If it needs a special dice set up you can create a Visual Dice Table. For most of my stuff I use the Text roller version. I set it up with a unique name and put a link for it in the character keeper.<br>

              <p>Great article! More people should be this transparent and this organized.</p>
<p>I love the attention to subtle little details that make people feel more included.</p>
