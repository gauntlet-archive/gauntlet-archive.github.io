This is a series using the quickstart of [Fight With Spirit](https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/fight-with-spirit-a-high-school-sports-rpg/), a game of school sports drama by [Vee Hendro](https://twitter.com/Rocketeer_Vee) and [Hayley Gordon](https://twitter.com/storybrewers) of Storybrewers Roleplaying. This game is currently kickstarting. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (October 2nd). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

Fight with Spirit is a collaborative tabletop roleplaying game about a sports team growing up together and fighting for their passion. In this game, you’ll hone your skills, face down rivals, and strive to take your team to the national championships. Along the way, you&#39;ll explore friendships, feelings, and the fleeting nature of your time together.

Fight with Spirit is built to tell sports stories inspired by anime such as Free, Run with the Wind, and Chihayafuru, as well as high school movies like Bring it On, and Remember the Titans. But Fight with Spirit is a flexible system that isn&#39;t limited to an everyday college or high school. We&#39;ve used it to play wizarding contests like the triwizard tournament, and set it in history like A League of Their Own.

In this particular run the sport will be Cricket. The players will all be part of the First XI at St. Osana’s School for Boys, an English boarding school in North Yorkshire. The year is 1922, the country is slowly recovering from the Great War, and St. Osana’s is on a losing streak in the Yorkshire School Cricket League. Will this year’s team be able to turn the trend around? How do they deal with leaving cheek-to-jowl in an ancient stone building in the moors? Can they put their rivals in their place, or learn to get along with them?

While some familiarity with cricket may help, absolutely no knowledge of the sport is required to play. Fight With Spirit does not require technical knowledge of the sport in question to play the game, and I’ll prepare a brief primer on cricket from my own incredibly inexpert position! This game is set at a boy’s boarding school, and as such characters will need to at least be considered boys by society at large, with characters between the ages of 15 and 18 (5th and 6th Form by 1920s reckoning!). We can discuss this in the lead up to the game, though.

Content Warnings: This game explores pressures on teenage athletes in a school setting, and as such may touch on themes such as teenage romance/sexuality, bullying, family relationships, and rivalries. In particular this game is set in a historical period in a boys school which might touch on subjects such as period-typical homophobia, classism and gender relationships. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
