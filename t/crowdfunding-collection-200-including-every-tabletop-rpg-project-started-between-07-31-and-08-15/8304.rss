    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2022/08/15/crowdfunding-collection-200/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #200, including every tabletop rpg project started between 07/31 and 08/15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The 200. edition of the collection covers two week and happens to feature exactly 200 active projects; even a Japanese ttrpg – the last one was in 2020. With the Zine Quest being a big reason why so many projects got launched.

Of the projects I like to highlight &lt;b&gt;Mail Order Apokalypse&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a zine-sized ttrpg about mail being delivered in a post apocalypse using Into the Odd inspired rules.
I did consider doing a brief introduction of all the games to honor the 200. edition, yet, well,…. 73 games are a few to many,… thus, take a look for yourself:
