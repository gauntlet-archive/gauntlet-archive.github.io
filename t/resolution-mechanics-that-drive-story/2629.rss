    <description>I&#39;ve been meaning to look more into other games that have mechanics for driving the story forward. As an example PbtA games change the fiction in a way that either demands attention or moves on to the next challenge entirely by it&#39;s design. Are there other games that do that particularly well? 

One idea I had (which is in a similar vein) is having the success and failure TNs overlap. As an example maybe all rolls above a 4 are a success, but all numbers below a 6 triggers bad stuff. The framework basically boils down to either the player makes something happen, the GM makes something happen, or they both make something happen. Thoughts on this as a way to drive story?

I know I&#39;m approaching this topic with a lot of ignorance, but it&#39;s one of those times where I don&#39;t know enough to know what I don&#39;t know and more advice or places to research would be a huge help!</description>

              <p>Tied and failed rolls in Fate are interesting. You’re supposed to offer the players a cost for success, a minor one for ties and a steep cost for failed rolls. That said, it’s very easy for players to win rolls in Fate.</p>
<p>I also want to give a tip of the hat to clocks (and similar tech) here. They are super basic and transparent, and I originally thought they would interrupt the action. I’ve found the opposite to be the case. Even something as simple as “The enemy is closing in, you have X actions to secure your escape” drives the tension home very well.</p>

              <p>OtherKind Resolution (seen in <a href="http://nightskygames.com/welcome/game/PsiRun" rel="nofollow noopener">Psi*Run</a> and <a href="https://narrativedynamics.itch.io/goblinville-core-rules" rel="nofollow noopener">Goblinville</a>) pushes a narrative forward by giving players a choice between consequences.</p>
<p>Players roll multiple dice and assign them after the roll to specific outcomes (learning something, succeeding at an action, not getting hurt) but rarely can get all the results they want.  The result is compromise in the moment and snowballing threats over time.</p>

              <p>You might dig our Soft Horizon series, The King Machine and Sand Dogs. It pushes specific ad lib work onto the ref based on resolution and gives you some cues. This tends to bend the story unexpected ways, though there is a creative burden on the ref to provide good Risks and have a plan (a simple idea, not a ton of prep work) for realizing them.</p>
<p>No stat blocks and a guided prep sheet that takes a couple of minutes before every session.</p>

              <p>Check out Blades in the Dark. I would say the system definitely drivers fiction forward by cleverly handwaving planning of heists, and rolls always drive you forward, with stress and heat building up unless/until characters resolve them. The game uses dice pools to measure degree of success and impact. Mischief guaranteed</p>
