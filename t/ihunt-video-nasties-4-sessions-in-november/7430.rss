    <description>***I’m saving one spot in this game for someone who plays their first Gauntlet game at GCOG. If that’s you, get in touch. If nobody takes that spot, I’ll add the first player on the waitlist a week before the first session.***

It’s 1987, and before apps and smart phones the only way to try and make a living as a monster hunter was out of the classified column in the back of the Weekly World News. But how do you tell a  *legitimate*  undead dream demon from some kook who just  *thinks*  they saw a zombie in a hockey mask out at the summer camp? Well, you better figure it out, or you’re gonna get crushed by the greatest terror of all: Reagonomics. 

#iHunt is a satirical, anticapitalist horror game about hunting monsters in the gig economy. In this game I’ll be using the alternate rules and setting material from the recent #iHunt 80s zine for a game of big hair, bright legwarmers and bad movie references. Touchstones include your favourite slasher sequels, Grady Hendrix’s  *Final Girl Support Group*  and Stephen Graham Jones’  *My Heart Is A Chainsaw* , although familiarity with these is not required to enjoy the game.

#iHunt is based on Fate, but no rules knowledge is required and rules will be taught in play. I’ve never run Fate before so I’ll also be learning as we go, and you should be ready for some bumpy stretches as I/we try to figure out the rules. 

Subject matter will include regular horror stuff including violence and gore, as well as economic horror, exploitation and poverty. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

We’ll be playing over Streamyard, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll send an email about a week before the first session to share play materials, confirm attendance, etc. I’ll ask if it’s okay to record and share the sessions, and will only do so with consent from all players. 

Please sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend. I think character creation is gonna be fairly time-consuming for this one, so attendance at all sessions is encouraged. 

Open access time for sign ups is 4pm 29/9 AEST.

              <p>Just bumping this game which starts in a couple of weeks. I have a spot saved for someone new to the Gauntlet - if you played your first game here at GCOG, or if you haven’t gotten into a Gauntletgame at all, please DM me to grab the spot</p>
