    <description>This is a five-session series where we will play a game of **Alice is Missing** first, and then play the same characters as teenage monsters across four sessions of **Monsterhearts 2**.

For the first 48 hours this game is only open to those who have joined the Gauntlet recently, or haven’t been able to get into a multi-session series since they joined.

The usual priority RSVP period has been waived.

*Joining all sessions is ideal but not required.*

**Alice is Missing** is a silent role-playing game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town of Silent Falls.

After character creation, the game is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually. They explore their relationships with each other and Alice while also trying to figure out where Alice may be. The game regularly creates new information and plot events through the use of card reveals that occur at scheduled times.

**Monsterhearts 2** is a game about the messy lives of teenage monsters.

Silent Falls is a small, coastal forest town in the heart of Northern California. It’s quiet here, and since the recession a few years ago, people are not as friendly as they used to be. It’s been a rough few years for everyone.
The major high school in town, Franklin Academy, lies nestled in the wooded hills on the east side of town.

All the standard Skins are available, though others are possible if the players have a clear vision for their characters that matches another - to be discussed.
