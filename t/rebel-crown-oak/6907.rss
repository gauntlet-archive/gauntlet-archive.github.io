    <title>Rebel Crown: Oak</title>

    <description>This is 9 sessions of Rebel Crown, to be run in June and July on Thursday evenings at 8 PM Eastern.

Rebel Crown is a Forged in the Dark game of courtly intrigue, feudal ambition, and perilous conflict. One player takes on the role of the Claimant, former heir to the throne who was robbed of their rightful titles. The others play their most stalwart allies: wise chancellor, devoted knight, idealistic noble, vengeful soldier, or opportunistic outlaw. Conflicting duties and ambitions will push them into points of tension, but their commitment to the Claimant’s ascent ties them together.

The Oak Campaign takes place in the Kingdom of Dol and follows the Darach Claimant’s rise to power. The Darach Claimant begins with a formidable base of power: with a province and a standing levy of their own. This is an ideal campaign for players looking to play a full campaign, but without the humble beginnings of the Eagle campaign.

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. All-Access time is Tuesday 5/4 9 PM US Eastern

I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Rules will be taught. Sessions will run up to three and a half hours. The game will be run over Streamyard. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils, script change and the X-Card for safety tools.
