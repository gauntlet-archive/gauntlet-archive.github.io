              <p>The personal fall-out from the previous session continues but then all hell breaks loose as young people start rioting all over Lower Park!<br>
Hotwire has to come to terms with the fact that sweet reasonablness isn’t always enough; Young Void wonders about joining the anarchy before his better judgement assets itself; and Blink pushes his ‘ghosting’ ability to breaking point to protect his family. Meanwhile, the Shadeux-Computer works out there’s more to the music these kids were listening to than meets the eye, but is interrupted when she gets a call for help.  After the crisis is averted and the villains plot foiled we finally see Hotwire make a connection with Shadeux; learn more about Void, and understand how his family’s values make protecting Lower Park so important to Blink …</p>

              <p><strong>Hit the Streets-Defend the Block: Lower Park (2/4)</strong><br>
<em>DUE TO AN  TECHNICAL ISSUE THE SESSION WAS RECORDED IN 2 PARTS</em><br>
The team follow-up on the wild party that they broke up the night before; sadly, the trail leads only to the DJ from the party … dead.<br>
Everyone finds their real life and their crime fighting life clashing as money troubles Hotwire, school cliques trouble Shadeux, the day job troubles Blink and Void blows an important opportunity. On the journey Shadeux is increasingly reckelss despite Hotwire and Blink trying to guide her to safer paths, while Void finds himself more interested in the conspiracy he’s convinced exists than in real life.</p>
<p>Part 1:<br>

              <p><strong>Hit the Street-Defend the Block: Lower Park (1/4)</strong><br>
We create the Lower Park neighbourhood of New Gauntlet City, and begin to populate it before Blink leads the team to the derelict Park Department Store to disturb a wild party. Unfortunately Hotwire attracts the unwelcome attention of some jocks and despite Void’s efforts, it is Shadeux’s gadgets that clear the room and give the team a chance to confront the dark suited organisers … who step through a portal to who knows where, apparently pleased with the turn of events …</p>
