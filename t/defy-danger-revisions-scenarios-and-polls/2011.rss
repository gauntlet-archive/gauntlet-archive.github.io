    <description>Let&#39;s imagine a version of Dungeon World in which Defy Danger&#39;s was written as follows:

&gt; When you ***take a big risk*** or ***push yourself in the face of adversity***, set the stakes and roll...
...+STR to employ brute force, power, might
...+DEX to act with speed, agility, or finesse
...+INT to use expertise, quick wits, cunning
...+WIS to apply willpower or sharp senses
...+CON to endure or hold steady
...+CHA to use charm, subterfuge, social grace
**On a 10+**, you do it as well as one could hope; **on a 7-9**, you can do it but the GM will offer a limited success, a cost, or a consequence (and maybe a choice between them, or a chance to back down).

Based on this wording of the move, would the following scenarios trigger Defy Danger?  Answer the polls!  (Did you know we can have polls???)


**Scenario One: Pickpockets!**
The PCs are in Shadizar the Wicked (a cesspool of a city if ever there was one). The halfling Fighter spotted Valieos, that dog, but Valieos spotted him back and bolted. The Fighter ran off after him, leaving the Bard and the Thief a-blinking in the seedy tavern.  We resolve the Fighter&#39;s pursuit with a custom move, but the dice aren&#39;t in his favor and I choose to *separate them*.  I switch back to the Bard and Thief and tell them that the Fighter&#39;s just gone and doesn&#39;t appear to be coming back anytime soon, so what do you do?

They leave the tavern and go check the street, bumping into a pair of red-robed cultists (the cultists give each other knowing looks, but leave without otherwise interacting with the PCs). They study the situation, trigger Discern Realities with a 7-9, and ask &quot;What happened here recently.&quot; I say that it looks like the Fighter and Valieos ran off to the north, towards the Maul--there&#39;s a merchant picking themselves up off the cobbles, knocked down by the chase.  

They help the merchant and the Bard chats him up. I *show signs of an approaching threat* (or maybe I&#39;m *offering an opportunity that fit&#39;s a class&#39;s abilities*, whatever). &quot;Thief, while the Bard is talking to the merchant, a slim figure jostles you from behind and you just know they&#39;re trying to lift your purse. What do you do?&quot;

&quot;I spin and grab the pickpocket&#39;s wrist before they can get away.&quot;  

Is this Defying Danger?
[poll type=regular results=on_vote]
* Yes, the Thief is taking a big risk
* Yes, the Thief is pushing himself in the face of adversity
* No, not Defying Danger
[/poll]
...
**Scenario Two: Uninvited Guests**
The next morning in Shadizar, our Bard wakes up next to his lover-for-the-evening. He&#39;s groggy and naked except for the sheet. His gear is on the other side of his companion&#39;s small, rented room. 

I *show signs of an approaching threat* and tell him that he hears creaking on the floorboards outside the room, and hushed whispers. What do you do?

&quot;I start reaching for my rapier and cock my head, trying to figure out how many there are, what they&#39;re about to do, etc.&quot;  We agree it&#39;s Discerning Realities, but he biffs the roll, and I *put him in a spot*. Before he even gets out of the bed, two red-robed cultists kick in the door and rush him, cudgels held high, what do you do?

&quot;I whip the bed sheets at them!&quot;

...
**Scenario Three: I Dodge!**
The Bard whips the bed sheets and manages to entangle one of the cultists. &quot;The other one rushes past him and swings the cudgel down at your head, what do you do?&quot;

&quot;Crap, I duck and roll to the side, trying to get out of the way!&quot;

...
**Scenario Four: Presenting the Plan**
A totally different town, totally different PCs, totally different classes ([Stonetop](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/stonetop.html), if you&#39;re interested).

The town&#39;s cistern (protected by ancient Maker-magic that purifies the water) has been violated by unknown saboteurs! The wards on the cistern have been broken and the water poisoned. A number of townsfolk have fallen ill; some have died.  The PCs still don&#39;t know who the saboteur is, but this a small, isolated town and there&#39;s every reason to be believe they&#39;re still around. 

The Seeker (a PC) has studied the ancient Maker-runes and figured out how to repair them: it&#39;ll take a few hours and some expensive ingredients, but they&#39;ve got those. 

The Blessed (another PC, well-known as the Seeker&#39;s mentor) has a move that lets him &quot;mark a boundary&quot; with magical writing that will either repel someone or trap someone. (The move doesn&#39;t require a roll until the wards are actually tested.) They decide that the Blessed will set one of wards around the well itself, to repel &quot;Stonetop&#39;s enemies,&quot; but they&#39;ll also mark a boundary around the inside of the cistern-building, to *trap* &quot;Stonetop&#39;s enemies.&quot;  

The Seeker goes to the town council, with the backing of the Marshal (another PC, who runs the militia). They announce that the Seeker has figured out how to repair the Maker-wards, and that he plans to do so with the Blessed&#39;s help. The Marshal says she&#39;ll post a guard outside the cistern while they work, to ensure the saboteur doesn&#39;t strike again.  That&#39;s their story. They distinctly do NOT mention that the Blessed will actually be laying down additional magical wards to repel and trap Stonetop&#39;s enemies. 

The Marshal does most of the talking to the town council, but the Seeker is there as well.  Is anyone Defying Danger?
[poll name=poll4 type=regular results=on_vote]
* Yes, the Marshal and/or Seeker are taking a big risk
* Yes, the Marshal and/or Seeker are pushing themselves in the face of adversity
* No, neither of them is Defying Danger
[/poll]
...
**Scenario Five: Repairing the Cistern**
The council agrees to the plan. Heck, they suggest throwing a big festival to celebrate the cistern being restored!  No one asks any questions or seems suspicious about the Blessed helping the Seeker with the runes.  Word spreads that the PCs are going to repair the cistern and purify the water. 

The next day, they enact the plan: the Seeker and the Blessed go into the cistern-building and start carving/painting runes all over. The Marshal&#39;s loyal crew are standing guard outside.  

The cistern is a squat, enclosed stone building from the time of the Makers, with one entrance and a circular well inside the building.  

The saboteurs, who originally poisoned the well and ruined its wards, are still at large. You, the GM, know that the saboteurs are actually a small conspiracy of families who are under the influence of a hostile faerie living in the woods, with long-standing beef against the town. The PCs don&#39;t know this, though.  

Are the Seeker and the Blessed Defying Danger?  
[poll name=poll5 type=regular results=on_vote]
* Yes, they&#39;re taking a big risk
* Yes, they&#39;re pushing themselves in the face of adversity
* No, not Defying Danger
[/poll]
...
**Scenario Six: At the Cistern**
The Seeker gets the cistern&#39;s wards repaired, and the Blessed lays their magical trap, and no one seems to be the wiser.  The next day, there&#39;s a celebration!  Everyone in town is invited/encouraged to come drink from the cistern. They cook a bunch of meat, pass out whisky, etc. 

While the Seeker and the Blessed were working, the Marshal and the Fox investigated. Various clues have pointed them to one couple. They go to went to interrogate their suspects. 

They find the couple at home, decidedly not attending the celebration and acting strange and apathetic. The Marshal pressures them to attend, inviting them to come meet the mysterious new stranger who showed up yesterday, having killed the monster who abducted the couple&#39;s child. There&#39;s a Parley, and the wife agrees to come (the husband not so much, but he wasn&#39;t a chief suspect for reasons).

The Marshal, the Fox, and the suspect arrive at the celebration and get in line to go into the cistern and have that drink of water.  (Remember, the cistern building is warded to trap &quot;Stonetop&#39;s enemies.&quot;) But the mysterious stranger is at the celebration, in a drum circle, and when he sees the suspect he gets murder in his eyes!  He stands up and makes to looks like he&#39;s about to come kill the suspect right then and there, but the Fox makes eye contact, gives a stern look, and shakes her head.  

There&#39;s a roll (let&#39;s call it Parley... the mysterious stranger has made it clear he&#39;s here to help the Fox, and respects her greatly, so her approval is all the leverage she needs).  She nails the roll, gets a 10+, so the stranger stops in his tracks.  

But! The stranger is a big guy, he just interrupted the drum circle, and he&#39;s still staring at the suspect. So the Marshal calmly steps between the suspect and the stranger, chatting the suspect up and gently guiding her towards the cistern&#39;s entrance.

Is the Marshal Defying Danger?

              <p>I really like the trigger, but (as mentioned above) having a choice on 7-10 ends up having the same problem that always makes me shy away from using Otherkin dice, which is that it’s way too easy when someone chooses “avoid the danger” for the situation to end up back where you started and the bard is just trying to go for the rapier again, dodging the enemy each time in the hopes of rolling an 11.</p>
<p>I think it’s stronger if it’s:</p>
<p>11+ You achieve your goal and avoid the danger.</p>
<p>7-10 You achieve your goal but the danger comes to pass.</p>
<p>Actually, would it be better if we changed “danger” to “cost”? As in:</p>
<p>7-10 You get what you want but you pay the cost</p>
<p>Calling it “cost” might help people frame the stakes better, especially in situations like climbing the hill. A cost logically can’t be something that stops you from doing what you’re paying for, so that might make it easier/more likely that the stakes set don’t negate the original intent of the player.</p>

              <p>I like this a lot better. I shrink a bit from making basic moves too wordy, but I think that once you internalize what this is really asking you to do, it should play out very quickly and consistently. (And since what it’s trying to do is basically “make Defy Danger work more like Ghost/Echo and Otherkind so there’s never confusion about what the aims are,” I am a fan.)</p>
<p>My only concern about the example you give with the bard is that if I were GMing that scene, the player got a 7-9, they chose “avoid the risk,” and they tried to follow up with the exact same move again, as if nothing at all had changed in the fiction, I would freeze up and wonder if I did something wrong. It’s not as if the original Defy Danger was immune to this concern, though, and I can think of ways I might still keep things moving (e.g., move the spotlight to another player, or come up with a GM move that changes the stakes or fictional positioning to avoid repetitiveness). Sure, if ti didn’t have the “avoid the risk” option at all on 7-9, it would force moves to snowball more aggressively, and it wouldn’t feel unfair to me at all (as you’ve already <em>offered an opportunity with a cost</em> and/or opted to <em>tell them the consequences and ask,</em> and they accepted that risk when they went ahead and rolled Defy Danger anyway). That said, I appreciate having the option to turn toward other GM moves if it makes more sense, so I’m not sure that would actually make it a <em>better</em> move — just a more prescribed one.</p>

<p>Looking at this list, I kind of feel like Defy Danger is trying to do too much (in a game with other basic moves, anyway), and it might make sense to have Defy Danger <em>and</em> some other, additional basic move, or even a new GM move or principle.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It definitely might be easier if the move were split into multiple parts. <a class="mention" href="/u/tam">@Tam</a>  has suggested over on Discord that Defy Danger would be better as two moves, one that’s proactive (“skill check”) and another that’s reactive (“saving throw”).  But, again, I’m pretty committed to keeping Defy Danger as a single move, for a number of reasons: aesthetics/sentimentality, reducing move bloat, and (to be honest) marketing purposes–it’s easier to pitch something as an “alternative” or “unofficial second edition” to DW when it has the same recognizable basic moves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally don’t think “move-to-earn-another-move” or “non-standard tactics in a fight” <em>need</em> to be covered by Defy Danger: The former seems better covered by GM moves and principles (or some new rule, like a blunt mechanical penalty as you suggest), and the latter could be covered by the same, or rolled into the other combat moves by offering a flexible “stunt” option or the like.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agree on the former.  I’ve been thinking more and more that’d it’d be easier to <strong>tell them the requirements/consequences and ask</strong>:</p>
<p><em>“The athach hefts a 5-foot long branch in its left arm and swings it across at you like a baseball bat, what do you do?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Duck under it, dart inside, and make with the stabby!  Hack and Slash?”</em></p>
<p>Traditional:<br>
<em>“Well, he’s got reach on you, so you’ll be Defying Danger with DEX to dodge and get close enough to fight.”</em></p>
<p>Proposed:<br>
<em>“Yeah, but he’s got reach reach on you, so you’ll be Hacking and Slashing with disadvantage.”</em></p>
<p>And while I’m generally not a fan of crude mechanical penalties, that honestly feels a bit better than just roll-so-that-you-can-roll.  And my gut tells me that it’s similar, probability-wise.  I still need to analyze that.</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh, have I ever given thought to <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>There was a whole series of posts and polls on G+ while I struggled through it, but in the end, I came back to a version of Hack &amp; Slash that is really quite similar to the original–the only significant difference being an specific statement that “your maneuver works.”  <a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/09/hack-slash-part-ii.html" rel="nofollow noopener">See here for that thought process</a>. So with that in mind, I don’t have much room for offloading this sort of thing to H&amp;S.</p>
<p>Thing is… I think a solution that worked for “skill checks” would largely work for any sort of non-standard tactic. You still end up with the question of “is it H&amp;S or DD?” but I don’t know that it matters all that much, unless one is clearly the “better” choice, y’know?</p>

<p>What’s left over are the “skill checks” and “saving throws,” but specifically only when making the roll necessarily means a change to what’s happening in the story at that very moment. Maybe that question of high stakes and changing situation could be part of the trigger, then?</p>

It doesn’t <em>fundamentally</em> change the move. Mostly, it just clarifies the trigger a bit (high stakes + danger looming + action = Defy Danger), and it cleans up the 10+ and 7-9 a little.  <a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2019/05/defy-danger-restated.html" rel="nofollow noopener">I talk about the design thoughts going into it here</a>. I’m pretty convinced that this version is better (sets better expectations, easier to read, provides better guidance, etc.) than the original, but it’s an iterative improvement.</p>
<p>What I keep thinking about is something that <em>forces</em> players to think bigger than “I dodge” but still works for both “saving throw” and “skill check” versions, both reactive and proactive scenarios, and could still work well in a fight. I’m thinking this (or something like it):</p>
<p><img src="//gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/c/cdeb7af7f52aab8376f2637ea3efd154ce8d5b0d.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="tnEoxhT44NrQnh0WWGmcbGh2sWh" width="453" height="445"></p>
<p>With this version of the move, when the Bard throws the sheets at the two cudgel-wielding cultists, we stop and clarify: what does the Bard stand to gain?  (“Tangle them up so I can get to my rapier.”)  What’s the risk? (“One of them bashes you with his cudgel.”)</p>
<p>On a 10+, cool… the cultists are playing Casper and the Bard has his rapier. “As you turn to face them, one manages to get free and brandishes the the cudgel, what do you do?”</p>
<p>On a 7-9, if the cultist gets what he was after but the risk comes to pass…  “Yeah, the get tangled up and you dart past them to your rapier, but as you grab it THWACK, the one closest to you gets free and smashes you in the back of the knee… take a d6 damage and you drop to the ground. He looms over you and raises his cudgel for another blow, but you at least have your rapier, what do you do?”</p>
<p>On a 7-9, if the risk is avoided, but he doesn’t get what he’s after… “The thrown sheets check their charge, but as you’re half-way to your rapier, one of them gets free and swings his cudgel right at your head, what do you do?”</p>
<p>Let’s say it’s that last one, and the Bard responds with “I dodge?”</p>
<p>“Okay, sounds like you’re Defying Danger with DEX… what’s your goal? What do stand to gain?”</p>
<p>“Uh… not getting hit?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I think getting hit is the risk. What do you stand to <em>gain</em>?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I guess getting past him and getting to the rapier after all.”</p>
<p>“Cool, roll it!”  10+ sweet moves.  7-9, either get walloped but get the rapier, or keep dodging but no rapier.  Miss = clobbering time.</p>
<p>The thing I really, really like about this approach is that it forces every Defy Danger into a “crisis + opportunity” state. You have establish something that you stand to <em>gain</em>, and it can’t just be “avoiding the risk.”  It means that a 7-9 result is always a hard choice (or at least a <em>choice</em>).</p>
<p>I also like how it forces GMs and players to communicate about both intent and risk. This sort of forces the <a class="mention" href="/u/jimlikesgames">@JimLikesGames</a> was saying about the thrown bed sheet in the first place (“What are you trying to accomplish here”) and makes us think through the risks. That costs a bit more in handling time, but I think (or at least hope) it would cut down on frivolous usage… if you can’t establish a meaningful gain or a meaningful risk, then just skip the roll.  Also… knowing the risks up front is good drama.</p>
<p>It <em>does</em> mean more handling time for the move.  And I expect there to be a learning curve, and negotiation.  Like, I think it’d be a common rookie move to have a player establish a goal of X, but the risk be Y, and they end up being (or at least seeming) mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>“I climb the ravine!” “Sounds dangerous. What do you stand to gain?” “I want to get to the top so I can throttle that cultist!” “Okay, you risk falling”  On a 7-9, the PC either avoids falling but only gets part way up the cliff, or they fall and yet make it up the cliff. Huh?  (I guess, yeah, they could fall and get back up, but that seems… wrong, right?)</p>
<p>A better risk would be: “Okay, but you risk exhausting yourself in the climb and marking Weakened.”  Or “Okay, but your risk taking too long and the cultist backing away, having time to prepare!” Save falling for the 6-.</p>
<p>But there’s still problematic risks like “Okay, but you risk the cultist blasting you with a spell on your way up.”  But what’s the spell?  If I get a 7-9 and choose to get what I was after (reaching the top of the ravine) but the cultist hits me with a spell… if that spell is a paralysis spell, or a polymorph, or just a concussive wave… those would all potentially interrupt the climb.</p>

              <p>Excellent breakdown. I feel like if you CAN somehow distill this into a clearer Defy Danger, it will be amazing. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> To get there, I think it might be useful to look at the bullet points you conclude with, figure out which (if any) might be cut or offloaded to other sections of the rules, and determine what those that are left have in common. Looking at this list, I kind of feel like Defy Danger is trying to do too much (in a game with other basic moves, anyway), and it might make sense to have Defy Danger <em>and</em> some other, additional basic move, or even a new GM move or principle.</p>
<p>For instance, I personally don’t think “move-to-earn-another-move” or “non-standard tactics in a fight” <em>need</em> to be covered by Defy Danger: The former seems better covered by GM moves and principles (or some new rule, like a blunt mechanical penalty as you suggest), and the latter could be covered by the same, or rolled into the other combat moves by offering a flexible “stunt” option or the like. (If you’ll forgive me for getting some OSR in our PbtA, I actually see these as potentially best handled by the “offer an opportunity, with or without cost” and “tell them the requirements and consequences and ask” GM moves, phrased along the lines of “<a href="http://www.bastionland.com/2016/01/choices-and-consequences-pick-or-push.html" rel="nofollow noopener">dilemmas</a>” from Electric Bastionland. E.g., “You want to throw sand in his face and then attack? Okay, you can hack and slash, but choose 1 less option.”) <em>(EDIT: This example would be better if there were a clear benefit from throwing sand in the face, so I’d want to rethink that by asking the player what they <strong>want</strong> to get from throwing sand in the opponent’s face. But I like the idea of just limiting what they can accomplish, or opening them up to more danger, using the options already built into player and GM moves.)</em></p>
<p>What’s left over are the “skill checks” and “saving throws,” but specifically only when making the roll necessarily means a change to what’s happening in the story at that very moment. Maybe that question of high stakes and changing situation could be part of the trigger, then?</p>

              <p>First off, that was a fantastic analysis and response <a class="mention" href="/u/jeremy_strandberg">@Jeremy_Strandberg</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, when I was answering the questions, for me, the dominant thing running through my mind was what was being risked at that action. What were the immediate consequences I could apply should a miss or a partial result happen. For me (I know this is sort of backwards) but I looked to what COULD be interesting if they missed or failed, even if I didn’t know exactly have an answer, but I felt like the situation could change in an immediate and interesting way, I thought it should trigger the move. I then assessed which trigger I thought it hit. If I felt like it didn’t really hit either of the specified triggers, then I also would say “Didn’t trigger”.</p>
<p>So for me, when I was taking the poll, I was thinking should ANY move be triggered because an interesting thing could happen on a miss or partial result. If so, is the move that should be triggered this version Defy Danger based on those triggers. For me, having a broader net would mean more things would be captured by Defy Danger. But if there were another more specific move out there it would probably trigger first.</p>
<p>So my votes may not have been the most useful to you, as I clearly answered in away that was NOT testing what I think you wanted to test. Thinking back I probably could have answered the way you wanted based on the instructions… I just didn’t.</p>
<p>For better or worse my mental loop is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Player: I want to do this thing!</li>
<li>Me: Cool. [to myself] are there interesting possible things for miss or partial hit?<br>
a. Nope, can’t think of any. No move trigger either they just do the thing or tell them why the move they want doesn’t actually trigger.<br>
b. Yup, interesting things could happen. Figure out what move is the most specific, do that. If no specific moves fit, look at “defy danger/keep cool”, if that fits do that. If it doesn’t. Just do an MC reaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably something I should think about for “Defy Danger/Keep Your Cool”. About actually looking at those specific triggers and what they should be triggered on.</p>
<p>Anyways thanks for the great insight on Defy Danger.</p>

<p>I am also still unclear on when you WANT it to trigger, versus when you’d grudgingly accept one might call for a roll.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s a fair question, and if I was sure (and could articulate it), I’d make that be the trigger, right?</p>
<p>Like, there probably a number of “categories” of Defy Danger getting triggered, right?</p>
<p><strong>As a “skill check”</strong> (knowing that, yes, that’s a very loaded term). The PC says they do something that is itself inherently dangerous or very difficult:  climbing the icy cliff… leaping the chasm… sneaking into the bandit camp… running all night to get news to the count… figuring out the pattern before the crystal explodes… fitting in during the prince’s gala.</p>
<p>These are cool and fine when the stakes are significant. They’re un-fun when the threshold for triggering the move is too low, and you get asked to Defy Danger to scramble up a steep slope to see what’s on the other side, with no monsters are pressure, etc. The only “stakes” are likely your dignity, maybe some gear or HP, and… meh?</p>
<p><strong>As a “saving throw”</strong>, when the GM makes a soft move that sets up something bad and says “what do you do?” and the player has their PC react to avoid or prevent it.  A fireball is incoming… “I dive for cover!”  The monster is <em>terrifying</em> and you feel yourself freeze up &gt;&gt; “Screw that, I howl my rage and charge!”  The knife just nicked you but the wound is burning way more than it should, you feel your arm start to convulse &gt;&gt; “I grit my teeth and press on!”</p>
<p>These are cool when the player takes the situation and reacts in a bold, interesting way that changes up the situation regardless of success or failure.  Diving for cover against that fireball is obvious, but still pretty cool, because even on a success they just <em>dove for cover</em>… they’re not standing where they were anymore, and the situation will be different when this is done.  Howling in rage and charging the monster is again kind of obvious but still pretty cool, cuz it establishes bold action… on a hit, they’re <em>charging the monster</em> and that’s a dynamic situation to resolve.  Gritting their teeth and pressing on despite the poison is, again, obvious, and honestly not very interesting.  But at least we get some characterization out of it?</p>
<p>These are less cool, and a little disappointing, when the declared reaction is boring and doesn’t significantly change the situation or reveal anything about the character.  Monster swings at you &gt;&gt; “I dodge out of the way?”  Okay, well… that resolves <em>that blow</em>, I guess. The move doesn’t really generate much of a snowball… we’re down to GM principles to keep things moving in an interesting way.  Which isn’t bad, but… I dunno, it’d be nice if the move itself did some of the lifting?  Or just got out of the way until the character did something that was interesting and potentially situation-changing.</p>
<p><strong>As a move-to-allow-another-move,</strong> as in “I rush in swinging with my sword, stabby stabby”  “He’s got reach on you… you want to stabby stabby, you’ll have to get past his spear.”  “Oh, then i’ll like smash that spear aside and down into the ground, <em>then</em> lunge at him and stabby stabby.”  “Okay, Defy Danger with STR, I think, to get past the spear!”</p>
<p>This is basically the “skill check” version but with the rather explicit purpose of getting into position to do the thing you <em>really</em> want to do. Which, on the one hand, cool!  Work that fictional positioning, right?  On the other hand… it can feel like “rolling to get to roll,” which can feel… not fun?</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if that sort of thing would play better with just a -2 forward or imposing disadvantage. But mostly I think this is okay as-is, unless everyone starts ignoring the fiction and just treats as roll-to-see-if-you-can-roll.</p>
<p><strong>As a way resolve some non-standard tactic in a fight</strong>, like tackling a foe instead of stabbing them, or trying to disarm them, or trick them, or something like that.  Almost always interesting, though there’s often questions like “is it H&amp;S or Defy Danger?” or “Does it deal damage?”  Ultimately, I’m not too worried about these.  The PC is doing something other than just trying to deplete enemy HP?  Yes, more of that!</p>
<p>Though… I’m sure there are versions of this where the game would work better with just a GM move. Like, should it really be a Defy Danger to throw sand in someone’s eyes?  (I’m honestly not sure.)</p>
<p><strong>As a way to see just how bad a calamity was</strong>. E.g. the rage drake chomps down on your arm, hard, and does [b]2d10+3 damage, <em>messy</em>… is your arm still attached?  Usable?  Defy Danger (probably with CON?) to find out.</p>
<p>This is my absolute least favorite version, but it’s there in the original trigger with "When you… or <em>suffer a calamity</em>.  The GM is the one calling for it, but then the player has to say how they deal with it, and that’s just… very weird, and different from the flow of play. And besides.  if the GM’s following principles (Think Dangerous, Begin &amp; End With the Fiction), then any sort of calamity will establish all sorts of danger the player will defy (as a “saving throw” or as a “skill check”) when they do anything other than just lie there and die.</p>
<p>In other words: I’d be happy without the “or suffer a calamity” half of the trigger.</p>
<p>So where does this get me?  Other than bleary-eyed from staring at this screen?</p>
<p>I think most of these “versions” of Defy Danger are good and have their place, but I’d like a way to make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>When used as a “skill check,” it’s only for situations that are high-stakes and significant actions</li>
<li>When used as a “saving throw,” it’s only for reactions that actually change the status quo, OR the move self-enforces that a rather boring reaction still rolls into a change of the status quo (I’m thinking fo Monsterheart’s Keep Your Cool move here).</li>
<li>When used to a move-to-earn-another move, that we don’t lose sight of the fiction behind and let it turn into rolling-to-get-to-roll.</li>
<li>It can still work to resolve non-standard tactics in a fight</li>
<li>It maybe doesn’t need to be invoked for <em>any</em> non-standard tactic in a fight</li>
</ul>
<p>Splitting it into two moves (proactive skill check vs. reactive saving throw) might help, but I’m still clinging to my constraint of “let’s just keep one move called Defy Danger to cover both these things.”</p>

              <p>I definitely like the wording of “when the stakes are high” for at least insinuating that some actions aren’t worth stopping to roll for. It may come down to each group or person’s sensibilities for what counts as high stakes in practice, but at least you get people thinking about if this particular moment really matters enough to call for a roll. I could see playing with the wording of the back half of that sentence to get at the same thing (“you act in the face of <em>significant</em> or <em>meaningful</em> danger,” for example) to get people to think about it from the point of view of, “is failure actually interesting here?”</p>

<p>To put it another way: It does narrow things a lot to specify stakes. Do you want it to simultaneously broaden things by having it cover any “act” rather than those that are specifically heedless of an imminent threat? (Maybe you do!

              <p>In regards to “why not just rid of the move?”</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Part of my self-imposed design constraints for Stonetop and Homebrew World are to leave the general structure of the Basic Moves in place. I’ve fudged that a bit with Aid/Interfere and split them into two moves, but there’s still, like, Aid. And Interfere. So within those constraints, it should stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I <em>do</em> think there’s a place for a general “do the difficult/consequential thing” move, particularly in a game that has as much space as DW. Mostly, I’m looking for a way to raise the “threshold” of Defy Danger triggering, moving away from “anything that feels like it should require a roll” to… something more significant.</p>

<p>I don’t think this gets me to the point of ruling out “I dodge” from triggering Defy Danger, but I do think it rules out some of the more trivial things.  Simply leading with “when the stakes are high” rules out, say, climbing steep slope when there’s no additional, pressing threat, or (in most cases) grabbing a street urchin’s wrist as they try to lift your purse. I think!</p>
<p>Interested if anyone thinks that phrasing would cover <em>more</em> situations than “act despite an imminent threat” or “take a big risk/push yourself in the face of adversity”.</p>

              <p>The part about the wording I don’t care for is ‘taking a big risk.’ By the nature of moves, don’t they all require uncertainty of outcome, which is in essence a risk that the character is taking, or you wouldn’t roll? What that means to me is that ALL moves indicate a taking a risk, so what makes this move distinct and interesting from the others? If we go back to one interpretation, Defy Danger was meant to map to Saving Throws in D&amp;D. If that is the basis, it’s not really about risk, but about <em>avoiding</em> something bad happening (e.g., dodging a fireball) in a specific way (e.g., brute force, wits, speed, etc.).</p>
<p>And going down the path you had started, what would move would trigger in these scenarios if not Defy Danger, as you had hinted? Just fiction (e.g., they do it?)? Hack and Slash for the sheet dodge? Beat 'Em at Their Own Game for catching the pickpocket (that’s not a move of course, but the idea behind it feels closer to what would work there, with the trigger being a contest of skill/talent that could parse to STR, DEX, CON, etc. easily; the consequences could be interesting also, flowing from that trigger and name)?</p>

              <p>I love WoDu because it’s just so easy. But while I feel like I get how to use this move in DW, it does annoy me at times because it feels like an extra step I need to deal with, rather than neatly folded into the existing system of moves. I think that’s what worries me about redesigning or rephrasing it such that it might be triggered even more often. It sounds like the intent here is to phrase it such that it triggers even less often, which I appreciate in theory, but it certainly makes me wonder if there’s a way to do it that doesn’t feel like an extra step.</p>

              <p>I hesitated around the dodge thing and didn’t know how to answer. I agree that it’s not all that interesting and the fiction can move on to some other moment that better deserves a roll, but I recognized how commonly dodging out of a telegraphed attack is a Defy Danger roll in traditional Dungeon World. I think some of that ingrained behavior on what the roll is for might be informing some of these answers? I recognize that you’re trying to word it in such a way to reshape how people use the move, but my guess is that that might be where some people’s answers are coming from?</p>
<p>I haven’t thought through the whole move structure of the game incredibly in depth, but I might echo <a class="mention" href="/u/rabalias">@rabalias</a> question-- if the move seems like it gets called on for less interesting actions that people should just play out fictionally, is it worth just getting rid of the move?</p>
<p>P.S. I always get the vague sense that there’s a lot of fatigue around Dungeon World talk, and especially Defy Danger, but I’m relatively new to the scene, so I apologize if “maybe just get rid of the move” is nothing new XD</p>

</aside>
<p>Eh, not necessarily even a “hoped,” but… I was kind of hoping for more “not Defying Danger” answer all around. Particularly on the first 3.</p>
<p>I think it <em>might</em> be good for the game if, when the Bard says “I dodge!” we all agree that a move doesn’t trigger, because it’s kind of a boring thing to say.  Like, what if, when the Bard says “I dodge out of the way!” we just say “okay” and then make another GM move, either offering an opportunity or putting him in a spot, or otherwise provoking and escalating until the Bard says or does something that would either trigger a different move (like Discern Realities or Hack &amp; Slash), or significantly shift the status quo and momentum (like diving out the window or bumrushing the cultist in an effort to get to his gear, etc.).  If “I dodge” wasn’t really considered part of the trigger, then all we’d be left with is GM moves, and that <em>might</em> be desirable.</p>
<p>So what I was kind of hoping was that the more-extreme language in the trigger would would make scenario 1 (the pick pocket) definitely <em>not</em> Defying Danger, and scenarios 2 and 3 have a larger percentage of “not Defying Danger.”  But I’m not <em>really</em> surprised to see that they aren’t, if that makes sense.</p>

              <p>My concerns about the wording are:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Push yourself in the face of adversity” is so broad that it potentially overlaps with any other existing move in a dangerous situation, like combat moves. (Maybe you’ve rephrased those enough that that’s not an issue, though.)</li>
<li>“Take a big risk” is less specific and concrete than “act despite an imminent threat.” I know that the original version of Defy Danger is not for when I’m focusing wholly on mitigating an imminent threat, but for when I’m doing something else, knowing that the threat could come back to bite me. And “imminent” is really crucial in that original phrasing — in the example of hiding information about the wards, I do think they’re taking some big risks, like alienating people if it comes out what they’re really doing, or not adequately selling the story of their intent with a spy listening. But it’s not an <em>imminent threat,</em> so I’d know not to use the original Defy Danger, and I’m iffy on whether your version counts. And for that reason…</li>
<li>I’m not really sure the name “Defy Danger” actually fits with this move’s text.</li>

              <p>What I found hard about this phrasing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not clear if “take a big risk” applies to risks that are already baked into the situation. Ex: the priests are probably going to cudgel you anyway, so are you taking a risk by flicking your sheet at them?</li>
<li>Not clear what constitutes pushing yourself. Is it doing something difficult? Difficult for anyone or difficult for you? Are we talking about exceeding your usual limitations, or just having to exert your usual abilities?</li>
</ul>
<p>This led to me choosing “not defying danger” in several situations that I thought really ought to count.</p>
