Places, like people, sometimes go wrong. They turn off the path and head into the shadows, becoming something other than normal. Black places filled with blank rooms, closed doors, and empty hallways lined with dust.

Music from a darkened Room is a scenario by Dennis Detwiller and we are using a playtest version of Cthulhu Dark Green a rules lite RPG by Justin Ford.

You are playing agents of a conspiracy inside the US government sometimes referred to as “Delta Green” or simply called “The Program”. Its goal is to contain or eliminate unnatural and alien threats and to prevent information about them from leaking to the public.  

This session will last for approximately 3.5 hours. It will be recorded if everyone is in agreement. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged, but not required. 

The game may contain themes of violence, suicide, paranoia and mental illness. We will be using the X-Card.
