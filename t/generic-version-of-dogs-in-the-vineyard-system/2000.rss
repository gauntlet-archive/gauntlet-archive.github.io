    <description>I haven&#39;t checked this out yet, but  KN Obaugh released a *Dogs* (&quot;the Dice pool and mOral predicament based Generic roleplaying System&quot;), which is a generic version of the *Dogs in the Vineyard* system blessed by Vincent Baker.

              <p>Sure, but that’s not changing the theme, it’s changing the setting, right? I’m currently playing <em>Apocalypse World</em> set in an <em>Expanse</em>-like future, which is a different setting, but we didn’t touch the rules. It’s still a game about scarcity and tribalism and the repercussions of collapse and the moral limits of human turpitude.</p>

              <p>Thank you for pointing this out!</p>
<p>In the original text, Vincent Baker suggested ways to reskin the Faith in the game, including playing as Dominican “Dogs of the Lord” searching for heresy in 13th century Europe. So a genericized system that enables that gameplay seems in keeping with what Baker laid out in those design notes. And I think someone passionate about, say, medieval European religious history can now adapt Dogs mechanics to run a series that has its own uniqueness, fascination, and point of view.</p>

              <p>I’d be interested to know how it handles the situational aspects of the game. Having tried a setting change with Dogs myself, I found the game was surprisingly (to me) sensitive, with what seemed like fairly minor changes turning out to stop the game working as intended.</p>

              <p>I’m kinda with <a class="mention" href="/u/jmstar">@Jmstar</a> here. I don’t want to rain on anyone’s parade, but what I love about a lot of Indie games is the way the setting and the system are intimately connected in a way which produces a unique experience.  I’m not a huge fan of generic systems in general because I think that systems deeply rooted in the setting produce an experience which is more specific and more interesting.</p>

              <p>On a personal level this always depresses me, because I love games that are rooted in some real experience, want to say something, and have a point of view. Stripping the stuff that makes <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> unique and fascinating just seems tone-deaf and sad, like the guy who wrote me all excited about using the <em>Night Witches</em> rules to play a U-Boat crew.</p>
