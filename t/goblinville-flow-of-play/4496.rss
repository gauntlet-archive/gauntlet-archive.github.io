    <title>Goblinville: Flow of Play</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/goblinville-flow-of-play/4496</link>
    <description>I made a flowchart outlining the moment-to-moment procedures that pace a session of Goblinville.  I was inspired by John Harper&#39;s diagram showing [&quot;what you *actually* do in World of Dungeons&quot;](https://twitter.com/john_harper/status/1116213309261246464?s=20) and @Jeremy_Strandberg&#39;s [Framework for GMing Dungeon World](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2020/01/my-framework-for-gming-dungeon-world.html).

![Goblinville Procedures|666x500](upload://whhYjTjQNe1tLWpGNM7aAwFIsth.png) 

I think something like this would be really useful for learning new systems and might reveal surprising similarities and differences among systems.  For example, I imagine different PbtA games have very different flows, even when their systems share a lot of elements (2d6+stat, playbook moves, etc).

I&#39;d be curious to hear what people think of this kind of information design as it relates to RPGs.</description>

              <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>I commented on Twitter, but this is a better venue for detailed discussion. Great chart!</p>
<p>I like to consider two audiences: for the designer, this is an analysis tool. One, it helps you check for consistency. Two, it is a measure of complexity.</p>
<p>For a player, it supports the communication of the rules. Creating flowcharts for players requires some user experience effort and graphic design. So, it’s more costly and has to be weighed against other priorities.</p>

              <p>When I was designing Goblinville I thought a lot about the ways in which it was influenced by PbtA design.  We don’t pitch it as a PbtA game (as this would generate inaccurate expectations) but we acknowledge the influence of PbtA in the text.</p>
<p>Looking at this diagram makes this influence a lot more overt to me.  There are several ‘moves’ baked into the procedures, even if they aren’t called that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GM makes a move (Target first goblin in marching order) when the players look to them to see what happens next.</li>
<li>Short of a roll, the GM can “tell them the consequences and ask”.</li>
<li>The consequences for Dangers and failed Actions (inflict a condition, mess with their stuff, announce offscreen badness) work like GM moves.  (This one might be a stretch, as the GM introducing consequences is nearly universal in GM-ed systems.)</li>
<li>The core player move (Take a risky action) triggers the roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sure there are others in there.  A lot of these procedures are common across rpg systems, but the way that PbtA explicitly designs for momentum had a strong influence on Goblinville.</p>

              <p>I think you’re right!</p>
<p>Here’s the passage on Marching Order:<br>
<img src="//gauntlet-discourse-store.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/0/0c5fbdf9502537143bea66bb1aee97bf766903c4.png" alt="march" data-base62-sha1="1LsR4ULk3YWAX1rK32eBqTyh4gs" width="369" height="331"></p>
<p>Let’s say the GM tells the player the consequence of their action “If you climb into the nest of the ghost crows, you’ll be in a bad position.  Their call rattles around in your head and throws off your balance”.</p>
<p>The player declines: they’re curious about the contents of the nest, but not <em>that</em> curious.</p>
<p>The stakes are unchanged and the GM doesn’t have to establish a new situation, which is why I initially said that the next step is the GM addressing the first goblin in marching order; that tends to keep the momentum up much more than directing the question at the whole table.  However, that’s a practice rather than a procedure (if the situation remains unchanged, don’t wait as long before you escalate).</p>
<p>Sometimes players will have a question right away or will jump right into an alternate action.  If so, the GM shouldn’t cut them off.  I’m editing the diagram now.  Thanks!</p>

              <p>Very nice!</p>
<p>One question: Is it intentional that the “Player declines cost” arrow points to “GM Targets first in Marching Order” rather than “GM Establishes Stakes”? It seems counter-intuitive to me, but I haven’t read the rules yet.</p>

              <p>Michael,</p>
<p>That is a seriously well thought-out flowchart - one of the best of this sort I’ve seen. Nice work!</p>
<p>Diagramming RPGs this way, either from a play flow perspective (as you have done here, with each “box” referring to a game-significant decision or someone saying something out loud) or from a design perspective (showing then function of rules and currencies, as Ron Edwards has done in the past) can be a tremendously useful exercise as well as a great resource.</p>
<p>This one is particularly good!</p>
