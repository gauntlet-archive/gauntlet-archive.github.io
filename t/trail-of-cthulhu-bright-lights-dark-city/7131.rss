This is for five sessions of *Trail of Cthulhu* from Pelgrane press playing at 2000 US Eastern in August on Mondays. We will be using slightly modified rules, borrowing from mechanics from *The Yellow King*—but not making big changes. We will be playing in the Pulp mode. In session one we will set tone and safety, make characters, figure out connections, and get playing. Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. One seat is being reserved.

**Content Warning:**  *This is a horror investigation game—so be prepared for disturbing imagery, violence, and such. However we will be working to eliminate much of Lovecraft’s ideology: racism, antisemitism, hatred of the poor, villainizing all foreigners, and that baggage. Additionally, though the time period is 1930s America, we’ll only be dealing with questions of gender and cultural roles if a player wants that as an issue to play out (and the table consents).*

This game will focus on an urban landscape—a big city. Our stories will examine how agents of the elder horrors make use of these locales and how the rich and powerful can be seduced by darkness. It might also be about how we matter so little to these cosmic horrors. Touchstones will be *The Ballad of Black Tom*, *Raymond Chandler*, and *Uzamaki*.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links.  **CHECK YOUR SPAM FILTER** . Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The[ Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.
