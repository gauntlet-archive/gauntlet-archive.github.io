    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Hearthfire! This one is called “Three Dozen Precarious Places to Make Camp” (with thanks to @Alexi_Sarge  for the idea). We expect most entries to be for the fantasy genre, but any genre is welcome. 

Submissions should be no more than 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here in the replies, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please do not submit any entries with sexist imagery (we won’t publish it). 

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

Here are some examples:

“A small shelf of rock overlooking a dragon’s hoard—the beast slumbering soundly, but occasionally stirred by dreams of the royal treasuries it has yet to empty.” 

“We spent the better part of two hours carefully scaling the tower of the great wizard Themmnos, only to discover that the window we intended to sneak in through had suddenly vanished. Now, the sun is set, the way down is perilous, and our bellies cry for sustenance. Setting up camp on Themmnos’s roof isn’t ideal, but will have to do for now…”

              <p>Damn this accursed jungle! Our party has been stalked all day by a pack of dog-sized carnivorous lizards and harried by four-winged biting flies the size of hummingbirds. Imagine our relief to break through to the coastline: A spectacular white sand beach by a calm lagoon. Neither the lizards nor the flies followed us onto the beach, which we have taken as a good omen. We are now setting up camp on the sand as the sun nears the horizon. I feel somewhat exposed on this beach, but if something here is keeping those jungle-monsters at bay, then I’m all for it.</p>

On approach to the mining colony on Eta Draconis-VI, our shuttlecraft was knocked off-course by an ion storm, which also disabled our main engines. Scanners indicate that the uninhabited Eta Draconis-III is L-class with a marginally breathable atmosphere, and that we can reach it using just our maneuvering thrusters. We will attempt to land there and make repairs. Of concern is that the the last planetary survey team to that world lost contact and was never recovered.</p>

Just pay no attention to the strange cold spot near the fire ring, or to the not-quite-coherent whispers that start an hour past sunset.</p>

              <p>Making camp with the Bonvari is simple and pleasant enough: they are ship-dwelling folk. It would be just a tad easier if they didn’t insist that rails on ships are only for children… and if the clouds didn’t look quite so ominous. You weren’t born on the back of a whale like some Bonvari Wave-Runner, now were you?</p>
<p>Climbing the Sky Chain is never fun, and always a multi-day affair. You just hope you get to stop on a bigger floating rock this night, preferably a sold rock, not a dirt rock. Thats why you always like to tie your own life-line. You wish you hadn’t lent your second-life line to that wretch, Elan. He never was a good climber, or a good knot tier, and now that means you don’t have a spare.</p>

              <p>Well, this should be the most wonderful place to make camp: behind the time-locked door housing the entire distributor stock of Alasatarian brandy, the finest, not to mention the most expensive, drink in all the 14 kingdoms. That would be, if the alchemical liquor wasn’t explosive when dropped, or, you know, toppled. And if the room wasn’t stocked to the gills so there is little room to sit,and certainly no room to sway. And… if you hadn’t finished sampling an entire bottle of the stuff yourself just before the lights went out.</p>

<p>The hardest part of traveling by dragon train is that, eventually, you have to sleep. But the dragon train stops for nothing; the brochures were clear about that. A first-timer, you don’t have scaled boots, so you only hope your boots are scuffed enough to nestle between your dragon’s scales, holding you in place as you continue your journey north.</p>

Some lay prostrate, some lean, none are vertical. The headstones of graves, though the graves themselves no longer exist as either mounds or depressions; the years have leveled all. Scattered here and there, more massive blocks show where some pompous tomb or ambitious monument once flung its feeble defiance at oblivion. So old these relics, these vestiges of vanity and memorials of affection and piety, so battered and worn and stained—so neglected, deserted, forgotten the place – a burial-ground of a prehistoric race of men whose very name is long extinct?”</p>

              <p>“See, the secret is to hunker down in a chassis that’s clearly already been stripped. This is the sweet spot in the Zone, there’s nothing natural left alive, but there’s not enough cliks to make mutatoids, and the Scrappers and Skinners will have already passed by. Just keep your lights out, don’t make too much noise, and don’t pick one that’s too close to one of the kaiju skeletons. You’ll be <em>fine.</em>”</p>

The Fey are notoriously devious, and the Oracle warned us not to take their hospitality, but it’s one night, I made sure to pay in advance, and I can trust Scrig and Master Embersole not to take any liberties with the dandies or raid the larder. In the morning, we will awake, decline breakfast, and continue our journey to the Autumn Court.</p>

The dense asteroid field around it means Pangalactic Consortium vessels rarely approach, but there are wide craters for smaller spaceskimmers to safely land. The naturally-occurring gouts of green flame that surround Eurydice-429’s borax deposits provide free heat and light. And the crashed remains of an early exploratory vessel might even hold valuable plunder, if people weren’t so darn superstitious about alleged “astronaut ghosts” haunting the thing…</p>

A dung scented like almonds and ant spit will lead one to the base of trees where you can find what are jocularly referred to as Danger Hammocks (actually a variety of giant sloth that spends most of their lives immobile, dangling from tree branches.) Nestle right into some fur for a warm night, so long as one isn’t prone to fitful sleep or night terrors.</p>

The people of the Grass Sea though know another landscape above the homogeneity of the grass ocean, a country of spirits of place, ghosts and petty gods, but you, strangers and heathens have unwittingly camped at the center of one of the spirits’ bacchanals – your dreams will be troubled, and it’s an open question if all of you will wake in camp tomorrow morning.</p>

              <p>We never understood why anybody assumed that soapmaking in these savage lands was a viable business. There was enough wood left in the derelict shop to heat the large copper basin and take a jojoba bubble bath. An unexpected and relaxing moment we all needed so much. Later, when the fire had almost burned down and we had eaten the last bits of the rye bread, it was my youngest companion who realized that the remainder in the tallow store was not whale fat (as I had assumed from the fecal smell). After arguing for a whole fifteen minutes, Grillo finally convinced me that the few bone bits in the tallow were actually of human origin. We all bathed again, this time without any soap.</p>
