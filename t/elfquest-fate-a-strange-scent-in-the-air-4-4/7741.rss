    <title>Elfquest / Fate - A Strange Scent in the Air (4/4)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/elfquest-fate-a-strange-scent-in-the-air-4-4/7741</link>
    <description>&quot;There is a strange scent in the woods today. The wolves are nervous, and the air feels heavy with more than rain. And those tree branches, they twist like someone made them dance and then darted away, leaving them frozen. Something is ... not precisely wrong, but not exactly right either. What will your band do?&quot;

This is a series of four sessions of a game in the setting of the comic series Elfquest, using the Fate system. Familiarity with either is not necessary, rules will be taught and the setting explained.

Being able to attend all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Anders will be a guest star for this series.

**Venue** : Zoom

**Contact** : Players will receive an e-mail to check in about a week before the start of the game.

We will discuss Content, Aim, Tone, and Safety Tools in the first sessions. We will use Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door policy, and I will prepare a character keeper as a shared document.

The  **Gauntlet Code of Conduct**  will be in effect for this gam **e**  (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)!
