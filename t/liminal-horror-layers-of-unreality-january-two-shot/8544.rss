    <title>Liminal Horror: Layers of Unreality (January two-shot)</title>

    <description>The Skein, uncanny and terrible, exists beneath and behind our world as an amorphous, fluid, warping, and twisting plane of semi-existence. The Skein is a parasitic reality, siphoning off energy and thought from the shared dreamspace of humanity. The Skein doesn’t exist at all, you cannot find it. The Skein is all that exists, the so-called real world is only a comforting dream. 

You used to be just an ordinary person, but you have stumbled into the endless rooms of the Skein. Welcome. Now, if you can, leave before the Skein sinks its hooks into you, reforming you into a new shape. 

Liminal Horror is a rules-light modern horror game by Goblin Archives, based on Cairn and Into The Odd. The rules are available free online at https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/. Layers of Unreality is a procedurally-generated ‘void crawl’ by Josh Hittie, inspired by the backrooms creepypasta. I don’t know what that is but it seems cool! 

No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. Note that because the Skein is procedurally generated, I’ll be pausing when you enter a new room to roll on a bunch of tables and find out where you’ve ended up. Maybe that will be kinda clunky, if it turns out it’s too awkward I’ll switch and preroll the rooms but that seems less exciting. I’m sure it will be fun either way. 

The tone is creepy, atmospheric horror. Subject matter includes reality and identity breakdown, body horror, possible violence and gore. We’ll use lines and veils, the romance matrix, the X card and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

We’ll be playing over Streamyard, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll send an email about a week before the first session to share play materials, confirm attendance, etc. I’ll ask if it’s okay to record and share the sessions, and will only do so with consent from all players. 

Attending both sessions is not required, but please sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend. 

Open access time for sign ups will be 12.30pm 4 January AEDT.
