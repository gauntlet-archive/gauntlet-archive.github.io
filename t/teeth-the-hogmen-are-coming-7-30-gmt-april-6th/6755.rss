Teeth is the in-development game by Rossignol/Davies, a Forged in the Dark powered game which they describe as &quot;Jane Austen&#39;s Stalker.&quot; [This is a playthrough of the first teaser zine released, a simplified and relatively linear romp which gives a taste of tone and mechanics. It&#39;s available to download from Itch.io as pay what you want.](https://teethrpg.itch.io/night-of-the-hogmen)

To quote the manual: &quot;Night of the Hogmen is a grotesque, single-session table-top roleplaying game for 3-5 people. It requires one game master (GM) to run the game, and the remaining players to portray hapless travellers, forced to flee from a ravening horde of hogmen during one grim and grisly night in a cursed corner of 18th-century England.&quot; That sounds about right.

No Experience required of either the system, the fictional late 18th century setting or Hogmen.
