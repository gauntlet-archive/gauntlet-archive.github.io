&quot;I’m a scrapper — a salvage expert, if you want to be polite, but I answer to void rover, scavvy, kender, station-stripper, magpie, even dwang-picker. I draw the line at “junk monkey,” though, so watch it. &quot;My mates and I board half-destroyed Star Destroyers and orbital stations and anything else that might have some glimmer on it, kick in the doors, take down whatever security measures still operate, and plunder whatever’s left on the hulk. Sometimes, somebody or something has taken up residence, and we deal with them, too. The New Republic don&#39;t like us much either, so there&#39;s that.&quot;

&quot;Lucky for us, the township that we return to never asks questions. They need our salvage to keep ﬂying, feeding, and breathing — and perhaps someday, if we pile up enough provisions, we’ll be able to boost our way to some nice pleasure planet like Zeltros or Spira.&quot;

&quot;Between you, me, and this bottle, though, that’s pie-in-the-sky poodoo, a bedtime story to let the kiddies sleep at night. I’ll be happy enough if we can knock over a planetoid and set ourselves up for the rest of our miserable lives. Girl’s gotta dream, after all.&quot; 


I&#39;m going to use the premise of the Void Vultures game from Kallisti Press and use the WoDu engine from Cat Ramen in her Rovers game to run something I can only call Void Rovers!

A seat has been reserved for Tommy Fields.

-----------------------------------



This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is after the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).


This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded and shared assuming all parties agree.

There will be 2 sessions in total. Being able to attend both sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools Lines &amp; Veils and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use, as well as post-game feedback after each session.
