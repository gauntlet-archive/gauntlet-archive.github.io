    <title>Bump in the Dark: Cold Iron Blues</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/bump-in-the-dark-cold-iron-blues/8632</link>
    <description>It is darkest winter in Octonagon, in the heart of Iron Country. As midwinter approaches, people have reported strange sightings around the Sylvan WIlds, and not just in the deepest parts of the forest where such things are known to hide, but in the clearings closer to Last Pine, where teens go to drink, where lovers go to meet and where dealers hide their stash. And nearby, always the icepick tone of an electric guitar, playing the Cold Iron Blues.

**This is a series of 5 games of Bump in the Dark on Wednesday evenings in May at 8PM Eastern US Time.** Bump in the Dark is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of people who, for better or worse, have dedicated their lives to hunting and dealing with monsters. There are gruesome attacks, tense investigations, nasty cryptids, nefarious factions, powerful demons, action-packed showdowns, and regular folk caught in the middle. This is a game about investigating strange mysteries and fighting monsters. **Content Warnings for dark horror themes and body horror.**

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. A seat is being saved. We will use Google Meet for our sessions. All Access time is Thursday, M arch 9th at 7:30 PM US Eastern. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links and resources. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg), as well as Script Change for safety tools.
