    <description>I have three sessions of Jay Dragon’s *[Dungeon](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/5527230/venture-and-dungeon)* on the calendar for November.

![Dungeon|500x500](upload://9EnwmP5huk242r3fvvOhSF7BLSv.jpeg) 

*Dungeon* is a game of *[belonging outside belonging](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/belonging)* about “recapturing the experience of enjoying traditional fantasy narratives. You play a group of young kids playing *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* while grappling with the perils of high school, and how these things can intersect. […] In *Dungeon* , the characters the kids play are tied to the feelings and experiences of the kids themselves. The magic the characters can cast are reflections of the kids&#39; own skills and experiences, and the monsters the kids face are allegorical to the challenges they experience in day-to-day life. […] *Dungeon* is a queer narrative that features genders tied up in high school experiences and a flexible approach to the ever-shifting teenage identity.”

This game is scheduled for 3 hour-sessions using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). (Depending on how the early access goes, we might use [Role](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/role/role-a-new-kind-of-platform-for-the-rpg-community)!) If all players consent, it may be recorded and posted.

There will be 3 sessions total. Being able to attend all sessions is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

We will use the [X-Card](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html), [Lines and Veils](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html), [Script Change](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change), and observe an [Open-Door](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html) policy. All players must abide by the Gauntlet [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

All Access Time: Saturday 26 September 2020 19:00 UTC
