    <description>**Game 4 (and final game) of my Spooktober Saturdays Series** 

It&#39;s Halloween in Billings! You&#39;ve gone last-minute costume shopping with your buds but oh no! The Void has torn through into this world, trapping you in the Sentient Spirit Halloween with all kinds of horrible monsters and devils. Can you and your buds use your unique ways to save the Store, the town, and Halloween itself??

**For the first 48 hours please only RSVP if you are not already registered in another one of the Spooktober Saturday games.** 

**System** : The Tingleverse, The Official Chuck Tingle Role-Playing Game (modified a bit to make it easier to run as a one shot). All rules will be taught and references provided. 

**Vibe** : Comedy-horror

**Possible content warnings** : References to sexy beings, fighting, violence, scary things, body horror, sentient objects

This is a game using Chuck Tingle&#39;s RPG rules.  **It is a fighty/adventure game. It will not involve any erotica or sex** . However, if you are not familiar with Chuck Tingle&#39;s books, be warned there will be a lot of implied sexy things. Contact me if you have any questions or concerns!  **Safety tools will be in play.** 

**Breaks** : On the hour or as required

**Venue** : Discord

**Recording** : Only with enthusiastic permission

**Safety Tools** : Lines and Veils, X-Card, Open Table, Script Change, and any other/additional tools to suit the needs of the players
