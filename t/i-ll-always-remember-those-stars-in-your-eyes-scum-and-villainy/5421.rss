    <description>NUMBER OF SESSIONS: 8 - Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

SPECIAL REQUEST: For the first 48 hours please only RSVP if you are not a white cis man. 
CONTENT WARNING: Violence, drugs, possibly sex, other vices.

DESCRIPTION: Love. That’s what got you into this mess. That’s why you’re sitting here in this piece of shit spaceship, about to risk your life breaking into a high security prison with just a blaster and a lucky charm. But at least you’re not the only one. Some people don’t believe in fate, but what else can you call it when shit like this happens. I mean finding them, all in that bar, your new crew, each with someone they want to bust out of Isotropa Max Secure - all willing to die for the chance to hold their loved ones in their arms one last time. Cause let&#39;s be honest, we may not all get out of there alive. So here’s to you lady luck, and to you my darling. I’m coming for you.

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: CATS, X-Card, Design Pallet, Roses and Thorns, Lines &amp; Veils. The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct will be followed as well as an Open Door Policy (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
