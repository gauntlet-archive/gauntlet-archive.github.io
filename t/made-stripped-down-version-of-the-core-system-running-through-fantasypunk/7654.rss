    <description>Hey, folks!

I&#39;m exploring possibilities and I took some of the core systems in [fantasypunk](https://thegiftofdice.itch.io/fantasypunk) and boiled down to this very minimalistic system I hope would fit in a zine or 3-fold.

Any thoughts about it?

              <p>Hi,<br>
I like the simplicity of it.<br>
Presentation is a bit SRD vanilla : I’m in favour of picking the best setting, a scaffolding for starters, confident that players will break the mold when they are ready. A taste / lesson I learned from Lady Blackbird and <a class="mention" href="/u/rickard">@Rickard</a> in two different ways.</p>
<p>There’s a grammatical disconnect at a point where setting and game proposition have a disconnect too. This leaves a vague blank space, a leak. So, I’d say we’ll have profit if we begin working on it :<br>
“Come up with a name and pronouns, then choose 2 to 3 words to define your character:<br>
Scavengers, Bounty Hunters, Exiles, Wanderers, Scholars, Soldiers, Magic-Users, Rebels, Mystical, Homebound.”<br>
As an unbearable lesson giver I’ll let you find the incoherence. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"><br>
Or you can throw the towel in my face, we laugh and I tell you about The Party.</p>

<p>What I am trying to point out is that for me, it is too early to give any kind of deeper feedback in this stage. Its the regular, stripped down framework of BitD/PbtA fundamentals, plus some traces of taste and color. Sounds promising, but needs more detail to evaluate.</p>
<p>Thank you for your answers!</p>

<p>you know, I’ve had this raised before in other occasions and to be fair, I’m a queer ND mess from South America. If I survived here at all and long enough to make something, anything I make is punk.<br>
A less sexy answer is that this project started as a hack of <a href="https://acegiak.itch.io/dungeonpunk" rel="nofollow noopener">dungeonpunk</a>, so the naming convention was supposed to point to its legacy <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
