    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/11/30/crowdfunding-collection-156-abridged/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #156, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/08 and 11/29.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

As a result of my stationary clinic stay, a severe alergic reaction and a bone bruise, the collection covers a timeframe of 4 weeks.

Because of the circumstances, and that the collection covers 100 projects, about 21 english games, I could neither illustrate them nor can I offer an intro as usual. I hope you still find value in this „abridged“ version of the collection.
