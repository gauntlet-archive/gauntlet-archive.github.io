    <description>![Banner%20Term%20Limit%202|690x238](upload://lDxyITJCKrJODJWG2REHJw7whFI.jpeg) 
Last week I posted [a list from 2015 of the RPGs](https://t.co/HkpLF6uSTY) I most wanted to run or play. This week on the blog I update that list and discover just how radically my tastes have changed.

**[Age of Ravens: RPG Term Limits (Part 2)](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-rpg-term-limits-part-ii)**

Like...really radically. This wasn&#39;t an easy list to assemble. I had many games I put on and then took off the list. I&#39;m fairly sure of the top 25, but then it gets muddier. As I mention in the post, only six of the Top 25 games from my earlier list return for this one. Five slid into my #26-50, meaning fourteen of my top picks at that time dropped off my radar.

*What would be on your top list that wasn&#39;t four years ago?*</description>

              <p>Yes, I suspect I’ll be using some of the ideas Sherri put otgether for NSV. Figuring out mission structure, chases, and “coin” is going to be key. One of the things I want to do is figure out a way to mechanically tie in the Conspiramid to progress.</p>

              <p>First thought - could your FitD version of Neo Shinobi Vendetta be expanded to encompass Nights Black Agents? either in ruleset, or in story also??? i feel like the tone/style is similar enough.</p>
<p>as for what would be on that was not there 4 years ago, hmm…</p>
<p>Not in any order…</p>
<ul>
<li>Dresden Files Accelerated.</li>
<li>The Warren.</li>
<li>Impulse Drive (either Babylon 5/Deep Space 9 style or Blakes 7/Farscape style).</li>
<li>Don’t pay the Ferryman (my game).</li>
<li>The Between.</li>
<li>Demigods.</li>
<li>The Spire.</li>
