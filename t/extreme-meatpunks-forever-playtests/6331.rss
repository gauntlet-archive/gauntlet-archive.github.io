    <description>EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER

I have 3 one-shot playtest sessions of the upcoming Sinister Beard Games RPG EXTREME MEATPUNKS FOREVER, based on the videogame series of the same name and written by Heather Flowers and Aura Belle.

In this game you’ll play as part of a gang of queer antifascists in a strange place called Meatworld. All of the technology here is made of meat harvested from the dead god we’re spinning through space on. That tech includes meatmechs, giant flesh golems you can pilot. You’ve got one of these mechs, which is just as well, because Meatworld is full of monsters, old gods, a land that wants to eat you alive and so, so many fucking Nazis. You’ll play to fight Fash, explore the weirdness that is Meatworld, attack and dethrone God, solve mysteries like a gore dripping Scooby Gang, deal with trauma and if you’re lucky kiss a hot boy/girl/NB cutie. You in? You&#39;re in.

Be gay. Pilot mechs. Kill Nazis.

Content warnings for body horror (mechs in this game are semi living creatures of meat and bone) and fascism and violence, as it&#39;s a game about beating up Nazis. We&#39;ll be playing with lines and veils, the X-card and an open door policy.

Session 1: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MQ7u6_fKcpYU7EyCGO9

Session 2: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MQ7uX8yaNUU4uIfa0hu

Session 3: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MQ7utTJIgvfu3ASyZo8

I&#39;ll be running the same scenario each time, so please only sign up to one session.</description>
