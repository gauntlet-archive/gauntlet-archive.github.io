    <title>The Crimson Shadow of a Golden Cross (playtest)</title>

    <description>&quot;Once, cursed werewolves howled, consumed by their feral impulses under the light of the full moon.

Once, vain, bloodthirsty vampires toyed with the lives of humble folk and died in their clans’ petty disputes.

Once, the meek prayed for protection, and the Church sent forth champions to push back the night.

Now, that is all past.

The children of the wolves have their forest, the vampires have their citadel, and the Church has power over the rest of the land.

They say life is good now that we are free of evil, but I see the starving people, I see the fanatics, I see the opulent priests, I see the cruel lords... I hear terrible tales, both mysterious and mundane... There is still evil in this land. Only a zealot would believe otherwise.&quot;

This game is set in an original setting based on the Gothic Horror genre. It is meant to tell stories of religious corruption, class struggle, cultural oppression and grey morality.
