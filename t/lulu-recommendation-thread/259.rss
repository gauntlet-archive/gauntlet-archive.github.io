    <title>LuLu Recommendation Thread</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/lulu-recommendation-thread/259</link>
    <description>Lulu.com is an excellent self-publishing resource, and every so often they have a good coupon deal come through, and I always end up asking the same question in Chat: What do you recommend picking up from Lulu?

Please provide a link &amp; a short description of why you recommend the product, as to be helpful to our fellow Gauntleteers

One of my frequent suggestions is the [Storygame Names Project](http://www.lulu.com/shop/jason-morningstar/story-games-name-project/paperback/product-3594462.html), just because it&#39;s nice to have a physical resource to go to when you need a name, and also need to make a quick decision about how to flavor your world. Names have power, and giving an NPC a name that clashes with the setting can give your players ideas and clues on how to handle them.

I&#39;m also going to suggest [Society of Dreamers](http://www.lulu.com/shop/matthijs-holter/society-of-dreamers/paperback/product-11056447.html) as another good pick, because this game has one of my favorite setup mechanics: clearing the room by clapping and making noise in order to chase out the bad spirits, and then all focusing on a ball of light.  Outside of the game it seems a little laughable, but getting everyone to do this makes us all get into the same mindspace, and I think really adds to the subtle creepyness of the game.</description>

<p><a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/thomas-denmark/colonial-troopers-rpg/paperback/product-23972212.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Colonial Troopers</a> by Thomas Denmark is a game I picked up on a whim and it’s a solid OSR sci-fi game in the vein of Bughunters. One thing I really love is that there’s a class for each stat, and for Charisma there’s a Diplomat Class. Whenever you run into aliens, they are automatically hostile <em>unless</em> someone in your party has a level in Diplomat, in which case they add Reaction rolls to your encounters. That and the Constitution class (I can’t remember the name) gives you access to power armor. I think those mechanics are really clever, I feel like there’s a Rifts hack in those rules that’s dying to come out.</p>
<p>Denmark also designed a superhero OSR game called <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/thomas-denmark/guardians-superhero-rpg/paperback/product-22550133.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Guardians</a> and I think superheroes are a weird fit for OSR mechanics but it’s pretty capably implemented here.</p>

              <p><a href="http://Lulu.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Lulu.com</a> is an excellent self-publishing resource, and every so often they have a good coupon deal come through, and I always end up asking the same question in Chat: What do you recommend picking up from Lulu?</p>
<p>Please provide a link &amp; a short description of why you recommend the product, as to be helpful to our fellow Gauntleteers</p>
<p>One of my frequent suggestions is the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/jason-morningstar/story-games-name-project/paperback/product-3594462.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Storygame Names Project</a>, just because it’s nice to have a physical resource to go to when you need a name, and also need to make a quick decision about how to flavor your world. Names have power, and giving an NPC a name that clashes with the setting can give your players ideas and clues on how to handle them.</p>
<p>I’m also going to suggest <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/matthijs-holter/society-of-dreamers/paperback/product-11056447.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Society of Dreamers</a> as another good pick, because this game has one of my favorite setup mechanics: clearing the room by clapping and making noise in order to chase out the bad spirits, and then all focusing on a ball of light.  Outside of the game it seems a little laughable, but getting everyone to do this makes us all get into the same mindspace, and I think really adds to the subtle creepyness of the game.</p>
