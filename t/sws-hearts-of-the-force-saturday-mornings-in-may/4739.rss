Emperor Palpatine is dead. The Empire is falling apart. The New Republic is trying to re-establish control and restore the people&#39;s faith in government and common order and decency.

One of the projects funded by the New Republic is a holoNET show about Jedi, backed by Princess Leia herself to help raise public opinion of this long dead religion. In the Minos Cluster, a plucky HoloNET studio gobbled up those sweet Republic credits and produced  *Hearts of the Force* .

*Hearts of the Force*  was a holoNET show set in a &quot;bygone era&quot; with nobles and Jedi vying for love, honor, and glory, based on sketchy notes on the history of the Jedi Order and canon events, with a heavy dose of things made up on the fly for high drama. These sessions are the five most talked about episodes of the show, shared on data crystals across the galaxy.

-----------------------------------

We&#39;re playing s Star Warsy reskin of  *Hearts of Wulin* !!!

In  *Hearts of Wulin* , players take the role of skilled martial artists in a world of rival clans, conspiracies, and obligations. The game emulates films like  *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* , Chinese wuxia TV series like  *The*   *Smiling Proud Wanderer*  and  *Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain* , and Chinese martial arts novels from the second half of the twentieth century. In these tales, romance is as dangerous as a blade. Everyone has ties to factions, loves they can’t quite express, and secrets which will shake them to their core. As in the source material, stories in  *Hearts of Wulin*  are driven by the characters’ duties, romantic desires, and entanglements with other characters.

Sabine is a special guest for this series.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is after the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

There will be 5 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.
