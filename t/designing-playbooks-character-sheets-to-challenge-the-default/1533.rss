    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/designing-playbooks-character-sheets-to-challenge-the-default/1533</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just making some final tweaks to Bite Me! before it goes to copyediting and I&#39;m just adding some lists of Looks to move away from the default of cis/white.  I think I&#39;m pretty there on gender presentation and pronouns but as a white person I&#39;m really working on race.

I&#39;m using @MagpieMark &#39;s list from Urban Shadows as a starting point - because I love the way it changes the base assumptions.   But I wondered if the conversation had moved on from then and whether as a UK-based person I should be looking at this from a different angle -  for example should there be an option for people who are mixed-race.  

I&#39;m not looking for a perfectly representative list - just something that challenges the default in the best way (given the space constraints on a playbook) - but I suppose I&#39;m asking if there an obvious improvement to the Urban Shadows list.

For reference the Urban Shadows list is: 

&quot;Asian, South Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Indigenous, Middle Eastern, White, [space to write in]&quot; 

Although the game of Bite Me! is setting agnostic - it could be set in space or pre-historic times but most games will be modern (ish).

Can you please state in your reply what part of the world you are from so that I have some context - for example in the UK Asian would refer to South Asian people (that was the first thing I noticed when I read the US list).

Thank you</description>

Beyond the shift on the playbook look, it did require some real thinking on how the playbook archetype could be subverted (specifically the demon) not to be a stereotype and do some thinking about what that playbook meant in a different culture.</p>
<p>Specifically for the UK angle to your question - yes there should be a more nuanced look at race (West Endian, East African, West African, windrush, 2nd gen, 3rd gen, mixed race) have different challenges and perhaps a different lens of post-colonialism?</p>

<p>The one thing I would be aware of is to have the options using the whole singnifier and to stay away from fractions and percents. For example I am Japanese, Scottish, and American. I’m not half Japanese and 30% Scottish and 20% Northern European.</p>
<p>Some mixed heritage folks do specify those things for themselves, but it looks less good when it is a system having them specify it.</p>

<p>My takeaway from a few years of feedback is that the list is far from perfect and a bit USA-centric… but it’s probably an okay list given those constraints and caveats. In my experience, it definitely gets people thinking about racial defaultism, but it’s a far cry from achieving any sort of equality or making white folks feel totally comfortable playing another race.</p>
<p>We’ve always had the attitude that you can circle as many as apply, so folks like myself might circle “White” and “Hispanic/Latino” to indicate that we’re biracial.</p>

              <p>There was an interesting thread that covered a wide range of topics including race in pick lists early last month… There might be some useful data in there:</p>

    More games with safety, diversity, and empathy built into the game itself. 

Does anyone have any examples of games that do this? 


So depending on which portion of the original statement there are lots of different examples. 


Safety 
a. The start is including Safety tools and safety tool discussions into the core texts of books. This includes things like, The X-Card, Script Change, Lines and Veils, Subject Matter Discussions,CATS, Same Page Tool, Open Door Policy, Debriefs, and others. Just…

              <p>I’m just making some final tweaks to Bite Me! before it goes to copyediting and I’m just adding some lists of Looks to move away from the default of cis/white.  I think I’m pretty there on gender presentation and pronouns but as a white person I’m really working on race.</p>
<p>I’m using <a class="mention" href="/u/magpiemark">@MagpieMark</a> 's list from Urban Shadows as a starting point - because I love the way it changes the base assumptions.   But I wondered if the conversation had moved on from then and whether as a UK-based person I should be looking at this from a different angle -  for example should there be an option for people who are mixed-race.</p>
<p>I’m not looking for a perfectly representative list - just something that challenges the default in the best way (given the space constraints on a playbook) - but I suppose I’m asking if there an obvious improvement to the Urban Shadows list.</p>
<p>For reference the Urban Shadows list is:</p>
<p>“Asian, South Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, Indigenous, Middle Eastern, White, [space to write in]”</p>
<p>Although the game of Bite Me! is setting agnostic - it could be set in space or pre-historic times but most games will be modern (ish).</p>
<p>Can you please state in your reply what part of the world you are from so that I have some context - for example in the UK Asian would refer to South Asian people (that was the first thing I noticed when I read the US list).</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
