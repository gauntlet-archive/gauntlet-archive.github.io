    <description>@jesseross and I have been doing a lot of crowdsourcing for the Trophy world elements, and there will be more to come. We&#39;re using this page to collect links to all the various crowdsourcing posts. We&#39;ll update it as new crowdsourcing posts are created. 

Check out the links below. We&#39;re still taking submissions for all of them. You can submit as many entries as you wish.

    Bucolic. Pastoral. Steeped in tradition. The Levasti countryside is one of the most peaceful and beautiful places in the Kalduhr. It’s a land free of the stench of Ambaret and the terrors of Fort Duhrin, a place where you can live in harmony with the land, raise children, and grow old. But the people of the Levasti countryside are no fools—they understand that what they have is special, and that the Kalduhr has a long and terrible history which must always be remembered. They choose to remember …

    If the forest of Old Kalduhr represents mankind’s fear, then the Blossoming Sea represents its imagination. Over the centuries, all manner of treasure and people—even gods—have disappeared after setting out on its crystalline waters. In fact, a common saying among people wishing to account for something missing is “it must be lost to the Blossoming Sea.” Many treasure-hunters seek the capital necessary to fund expeditions to the Blossoming Sea, in the hopes of discovering (or recovering) these l…

    The ramshackle village of Kormoran’s Wheel sits between Fort Duhrin and the heart of old Kalduhr, just inside the edge of the forest. The residents of the Wheel make a healthy profit on the poor planning of the many treasure-hunters that pass through. It’s said that nearly anything can be acquired here, though those purchases are often of questionable quality or otherwise… strange.
