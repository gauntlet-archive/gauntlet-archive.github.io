<p>This is for five sessions of <em>Changeling the Lost: PbtA</em> on Tuesday evenings in August (US Eastern), a game about escaped supernatural beings caught up in a world which has moved on past them. You were taken into the Hedge, changed by your Keeper, and somehow managed to escape and find your Motley, a kind of family. In session one we will also set tone and safety, take about our city and freehold, make characters, establish the nature of our motley, and get playing.</p>
<p>Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. One seat is being reserved.</p>
<p><em><strong>Content warning:</strong></em>  trauma, PTSD, horror, controlling relationships, family divisions.</p>
<p>This is a hack of <em>Changeling the Lost</em> using PbtA to focus on the elements I dig about the setting. This is a work in progress, rough and messy but definitely playable. It borrows from <em>Hearts of Wulin</em>, <em>Urban Shadows</em>, <em>The Veil</em>, and more.</p>
<p>We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html">Gauntlet Code of Conduct</a> will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.</p>
<p>If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.</p>
