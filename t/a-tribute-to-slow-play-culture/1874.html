          <p>We know about Slow Food and why it‚Äôs good to take time when eating. Can we enjoy slow playing? Should we be more thoughtful about the pace at the table?</p>
<p>Often we celebrate spontaneity, quick improvisation and wits at the table. I love that, too. It feels great to be thrown into unforeseeable situations, twists established in the middle of a dialogue to which I need to react in-character suddenly. The expecting eyes of my players on me when I want to see what I do with a 6- result.</p>
<p>But first of all that is not everybody‚Äôs style and towards everybody‚Äôs talent. I often need to remind myself about that fact and that it‚Äôs my patience which is required not somebody else adapting to my need of quick reactions.</p>
<p>And secondly, as with Slow Food, maybe we should more often actively fight against the urge to run high speed.</p>
<p>A while back, for example, I ran Dialect in two sessions each 3 hours long. Taking so much time created such a rich play experience. Every scene was worth being extended. We took time for meta discussions and had longer breaks than usual.</p>
<p>Can you play slow? Do you enjoy it? Have you designed for slow play? Which games benefit from taking time for them?</p>

          <p>I really dig slow play.  We played a single campaign of Stonetop for just under 60 sessions.  That‚Äôs the sort of thing that Stonetop is really designed‚Ä¶ stories that unfold over dozens of sessions, years of in-game time. Lots of asking ‚Äúhow are you feeling about this?‚Äù and growing, shifting relationships between the PCs and NPCs and the community. Love it.</p>
<p>The Seeker in our campaign went from having ‚ÄúNot a fucking wizard‚Äù written on his player‚Äôs name tent to having ‚Äú(Probably) Not a fucking wizard‚Äù to building a tower just outside of town (cuz that‚Äôs where the supernatural weather vane needed to go, duh) to adding a Drive of ‚ÄúShame: Avoid or delay using your magical powers‚Äù to eventually destroying his character-defining magical artifact.</p>
<p>The Would-be Hero went from a being a doubt-ridden, guilt-ridden ex-slaver to slowly being dubbed Breaker of Chains by the Hillfolk she used to persecute, coordinating the war effort against her own father, and eventually bringing down the entire hierarchy of her people and <em>then</em> deciding to put leadership behind her and come back to Stonetop and get married to her long-time will-they-won‚Äôt-they sweetheart.</p>
<p>A 7-9 Parley with a pair of ghosts in session 1 led to some locals making bloody burnt offerings at the shrine of Danu in session 3, and the Blessed‚Äôs failure to directly and firmly address this led to a cult springing up in town a few seasons later, leading to a human sacrifice, and a sorcerer who escaped and became a bugaboo for the next year or two.</p>

          <p>I once played in a campaign that went for 14 sessions and covered 3 very eventful in-game days. It wasn‚Äôt slow in the sense that we took a long time to make decisions (though I‚Äôm sure I did, because I am <em>terrible</em> at improvisation), but we took our time and let things that needed to happen happen and gave the scenes room to breathe, and were rewarded with a much deeper and more interesting story. I got a little impatient with the pace sometimes, but I have to say I wouldn‚Äôt have cared nearly as much at the end if we‚Äôd kept skipping ahead to the next big event.</p>
<p>I often feel like I need to push forward when I‚Äôm facilitating a game, but as a player sometimes I want to go off on interesting tangents and have long conversations. So I try to keep in mind that as long as things are happening and the players are enjoying the game, the pace is fine.</p>

          <p>At the weekly game night I‚Äôve been running for several years now, I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at managing one-shots that pack in as much drama as possible and hit most of the points of a three-act structure within 3 hours. I can deliver the goods, and have fun doing it, but doing that on a regular basis can get tiresome. So the campaigns I run move at a much slower pace.</p>
<p>Currently I‚Äôm running a Freebooters on the Frontier campaign as an ‚Äúemergent‚Äù sandbox. Old-school wilderness exploration with resource management. I try to move things along if there‚Äôs too much of a lag, and try to end each session at a good juncture, but generally the pace is dictated by the players‚Äô choices and the vicissitudes of random generation. We just finished our third session, and aside from some marauding scavengers at camp one night, there hasn‚Äôt really been any fighting. Play has been mostly about travel, terrain-based challenges, and interaction among party members. After 9 hours of play and 4 in-game days, they‚Äôve only just reached the ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù that was their initial goal.</p>
<p>I love this pace because we‚Äôre not trying to emulate a movie or TV show, modes of entertainment in which our culture is already saturated. We‚Äôre immersing ourselves in something particular to the medium of tabletop RPGs: a world of our own collaborative creation.</p>
<p>Pacing matters, and I try cut past uninteresting bits, but I also try to find interest in mundane details by asking clerics what it looks like when they pray in the morning, or how the fighters care for their gear. The double-edged sword to this approach is that while the pace gives things a certain depth, it‚Äôs going to be really hard when one of the PCs dies. I‚Äôm quite attached to all of them.</p>

          <p>That is a very interesting point you raise here, <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/gerrit">@Gerrit</a>! I played with my long-running group over Easter, and while there was drama and decision and danger, there was also a lot of time just talking in character or about a character. So what if we devote time to talk about Frederik‚Äôs hats or Dairine‚Äôs children? Or stones?</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen these rather rambling discussions derided as ‚Äútavern talk‚Äù, because they don‚Äôt serve a real purpose in the story. That is a very valid point if you only have three (or even twelve) hours for one game, or if you want to recreate the feeling of a good movie or book. Still, I treasure them, because my weekend face-to-face group are <em>not</em> on a schedule, they have both run for years and will continue to do so, and I love the slice-of-life stuff.</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh, that is so right in this context and such an important element. Actually, forcing the pacing of TV shows on our games (sometimes referred to as cinematic play) is one of the (many) problematic elements of this way of thinking currently so popular in RPGs.</p>

          <p>I love this discussion! I‚Äôm mostly committed to fast play for a number of personal reasons, but you raise an excellent point, <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/gerrit">@Gerrit</a>: there are players who don‚Äôt shine when it comes to quick improv, but who can make incredible contributions just as anyone else if given a little time.</p>
<p>I have a friend who‚Äôs very creative but just freezes if she‚Äôs on the spot. If she has time to think about her character and the story, she comes up with amazing ideas.</p>
<p>Despite my preference for fast play, I ended up writing a game that forces players into slow play. Melody of a Never-ending Summer follows a strict day cycle, where each player is prohibited from actively roleplaying their character and must instead describe a brief summary of how they spent their day. The game only jumps into the traditional conversation of an RPG in special weekly events and bonding moments between characters (these have to be earned through play). There are other special moments that have to be earned by slowly playing through the days and working towards a goal.</p>
<p>I feel this makes those special moments very meaningful, and helps people who aren‚Äôt great at improvising to ‚Äúphone in‚Äù the day-to-day scenes and plan ahead for the special ones (and they know exactly when they‚Äôll happen).</p>
<p>Is it possible to conciliate fast and slow play at the table? Or do you think it‚Äôs something everyone has to agree to?</p>

</aside>
<p>That‚Äôs tough. Ideally, I think, you have two elements there:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slow play that‚Äôs actively interesting and engaging for even the players who aren‚Äôt directly involved in any given scene. (In practice, I‚Äôve found that difficult to pull off‚Äìespecially with a larger group of 5-6 players, which is what I usually play with face-to-face. I‚Äôve had better luck with groups of 3 players, and players who were all committed to the character stuff, like you often find among the Gauntlet.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slow play that‚Äôs punctuated by tight, tense action. Just because you have slow play, doesn‚Äôt mean it <em>all</em> has to be slow. When danger rears, fast, intense, consequential play is great‚Äìand gives excellent fodder for slow play later.</p>
</li>
</ul>

          <p>I wonder how much effect high-production-value AP shows have on our perceptions of how fast play should go. In a podcast format, all the pauses and false starts and sitting with an idea can get edited out, because that stuff is less fun for an audience person. And even in livestreamed games, the players view themselves as performers needing to be snappy to entertain the viewers. I know I‚Äôm always self-conscious about posting my Gauntlet hangouts recordings because I know they‚Äôre not as tight and zippy as, say, an episode of One Shot.</p>

          <p>I just started up a new group with people all pretty new to RPGs, and a particular kind of slow play has emerged in this group that I‚Äôd never thought of before: taking the time to describe places in extreme detail.</p>
<p>Once we know what the next scene is going to be, we regularly spend half an hour just describing what the place is like, who the PCs might know there, what people are wearing, how the Maitre D is looking at you, or how the docks workers aren‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThis is the kind of bar where there‚Äôs no door on the one bathroom, but no one cares. And there‚Äôs a thing in the corner some local inventor came up with; she calls it a pinball machine, and it‚Äôs constantly squeaking and spitting out black smoke.‚Äù These are the kind of details that GM advice is always telling you to include to set the tone, but I‚Äôm coming to really love reveling in them and getting the whole table involved. Doubly so for places we know we‚Äôre going to come back to or spend a lot of time.</p>

          <p>I think I‚Äôm constitutionally incapable of this kind of play. I‚Äôm in two weekly groups that meet for two hours each, and both my design and play are warped around this constraint. We have long-running games sometimes, but each two hour block is always a self-contained arc. When I‚Äôve played in more relaxed settings I just want to get more done - a four hour slot is just two, two hour blocks of intense fun, right?</p>
<p>I fully recognize that this is kind of messed up.</p>

<p>Part of it‚Äôs absolutely time constraints, but for me it‚Äôs also frequency of play and cycling different games. There are too many games to play, so if you can ‚Äúwolf down‚Äù mini-series-sized shorter campaigns and get onto the next system to try out, it feels like you‚Äôre <em>doing stuff</em>. If you can only meet once every 4-5 weeks, you want to get that good gaming juice.</p>
<p>I do like me some drawn-out descriptions of melancholy strip malls, though, so I‚Äôm torn.</p>

          <p>This is really similar to brain grooves I keep finding in my head that was put there by various RPGs (read: D&amp;D)</p>
<p>I doubt I‚Äôm alone in this, but here‚Äôs a few examples of how my brain is warped due to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When discussing a novel, a friend said the society depicted only works for <em>good</em> people. I countered with ‚Äúor Lawful Neutral‚Äù as, fundamentally, I think of alignment as a 3x3 grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of ‚Äúspoons‚Äù I think about ‚Äúspell slots‚Äù. Granted, I do this in part intentionally as I am lucky enough to not need to count my spoons, but still.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There‚Äôs a bunch of other artifacts of my thinking that come from gaming, but these are the most obvious. I think the first is actively harmful.</p>
<p>Edit: I‚Äôm going to move this to another thread.</p>

<p>I am often looking for ways to get into that ‚Äúmode‚Äù of play. Do you have any online recordings of you playing in this style, or other game sessions that you feel do this well?</p>
<p>It could be interesting to look at specific techniques and see which could benefit from a ‚Äúslow down‚Äù; it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs not a continuum from ‚Äúslow play‚Äù to ‚Äúfast play‚Äù, but that super interesting hybrids are possible.</p>

          <p>I don‚Äôt, we‚Äôre not public performers. And it‚Äôs hard to tease out what we do ‚Äúdifferently‚Äù since this is just how we‚Äôve evolved, but I know we aggressively edit scenes, keeping lots of balls in the air as we move focus around the table.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Jason!</p>
<p>I was typing in a rush (on the bus) and I might have come across as rather more demanding than I intended - my apologies! I‚Äôm still adjusting to (and a bit weirded out by) the new culture of recorded and livestreamed play. (I‚Äôm now running into people who say things like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to play D&amp;D with my friends, but I guess I‚Äôll have to wait until December, because I don‚Äôt have a good camera or a good microphone at my place‚Ä¶‚Äù Very bizarre to me!)</p>
<p>What I meant to ask in my second sentence was if there were any public game personas or groups that you feel approach this technical aspect of RPG play in the same way that you do. Have you seen anyone who seems to do a similar thing?</p>
<p>I still think it would be very interesting to approach this somewhat backwards: look at both techniques that slow things down or draw them out, and techniques that speed things up and give focus, and find new ways of combining them.</p>
<p>For instance, in a thread like this, it‚Äôs possible that what people are looking for or want to celebrate isn‚Äôt the overall pace of the game, but the inclusion of specific types of scenes or interactions (like sequel scenes, to use writer‚Äôs jargon for a second, which get omitted entirely in many games).</p>

          <p>One day I get you into online playing. Maybe a live action online game could pull you over the edge. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Actually, <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/paul_t">@Paul_T</a>, what you brought up about ‚Äúwhere can I see this style of play‚Äù is for me the most fascinating element of Actual Play culture. That we can see styles and play cultures from such different angles.</p>
<p>Especially pacing at the table is something nearly impossible to describe. But with an AP you could actually watch it happen!</p>
