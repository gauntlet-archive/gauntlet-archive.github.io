*You are vampires, masters of the night. You sate your thirst with the lives of the mortals in your thrall, and revel in your dread power. Still, when the night wind grows silent, you have moments where you contemplate the remnant of humanity that dwells within you. A voice inside whatever remains of your shadowed heart whispers that one day, this humanity will be your undoing. Few vampires heed it.*

*Blood &amp; Mirrors*  is my hack of Epidiah Ravachol&#39;s  *Swords Without Master* , aimed at producing vampire horror fiction about dark predators trying to forget the mortality they forsook. Gameplay focuses on powerful atmospheric tones and weaving the net of a narrative around these towering figures and the lives they touch. Vampires will be seen through the eyes of mortals, will be pushed to sate their needs, and they will be challenged to remember the ways they lived their lives before they came into this power.

**Content Warning:**  Themes of exploitation and power abuse are expected, along with violence
