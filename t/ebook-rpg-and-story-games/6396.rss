    <description>Hello everybody,
Can somebody give me an example of a game that&#39;s published in ebook format rather than PDF?  If it&#39;s free, that would be awesome. Thanks</description>

              <p>It’s really about the accessibility, mostly because while you <em>can</em> do some pretty wild things in an ebook, support for more advanced features across various devices is kinda like web browsers in the 90s…different, patchy, and inconsistent. Hopefully it will continue to standardize but we have to rely on Amazon to come into line with the format’s actual standards…</p>

              <p>I am very interested in ebooks as game texts and games, but I don’t know as much as I would like to about what features that they have that can enhance game play.</p>
<p>There are the accessibility features mentioned above. This is super important for reaching a broader audience–giving everyone a chance to enjoy our hobby.</p>
<p>Are there any features with the new ePub3 standard that could improve play for all audiences? Plugins, features, and what-not that would make them a better distribution format that PDF? Better in game? etc.?</p>
<p>For example, can an ebook include a die roller or form-fillable character sheets?</p>

              <p>To add what Nickwedig mentioned: Reflowing layout. Whatever the screen size or format, an ebook can change its layout to conform to that screen. (And its text size/font setting, etc.)</p>
<p>Also they are easily copy-pastable out of the box and can generally be converted into other file formats without problems.</p>
<p>(DRM schemes might change all of those, but for DRM-free ebooks the above should hold.)</p>
