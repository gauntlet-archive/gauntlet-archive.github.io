    <description>**One seat is reserved for a player who joined the Gauntlet in 2021. If that’s you, please message me to claim the spot.**

“This world is fragile. Many things howl at the edges of reality, many claws reach out to find a way in. There are ancient doors of power that connect this world to destiny. If harbingers of the apocalypse open enough of these doors, the world will end on their terms.”

In Apocalypse Keys, by the Gauntlet’s own Jammi and in development from Evil Hat Games, you play monstrous agents of an organisation called DIVISION, tasked with protecting the world from terrifying evils while struggling with the darkness that calls out to you. The main touchstones are Hellboy comics and movies and other ‘investigating the strange’ stories like Men In Black and Doom Patrol. No rules knowledge is expected and all rules will be taught in play. 

We will use the X Card, Lines and Veils and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. The sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players. Please sign up for all sessions you&#39;d like to attend. 

Open sign ups from 2.30pm 20/3/21 AEDT.
