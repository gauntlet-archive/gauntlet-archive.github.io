    <title>What&#39;s Your Favorite Flashback Move?</title>

    <description>In some games, players can narrate a **flashback** for their character. This usually delivers a fictional and/or mechanical bonus in the current scene.

I love this idea, because it encourages people to develop their character&#39;s backstory over a series of sessions (&quot;Play to find out what had happened&quot;). It also overcomes a practical limitation of collaborative improvisation: If the characters were real they would take steps to prepare for the situations they&#39;re in.

Anyway, I&#39;m working on a game about &quot;80s buddy cop movies,&quot; and flashbacks are essential to the genre. I&#39;m curious to hear about games where you think this mechanic is well implemented.</description>

              <p>I already said this in Twitter, but for anyone who missed it, <em>Pasion de las Pasiones</em> has a killer soap opera-inspired Flashback mechanic (a couple, actually).</p>

              <p>I always enjoyed the Blades in the Dark approach, specifically designed to short-circuit analysis paralysis in heist-planning. You drop right into the action of a mission with the Engagement Role, then at any point you can mark a Stress to have a flashback. It’s the GM’s call whether the flashback itself requires a roll. Then once that’s resolved one way or another, you jump back into the main action, reaping the rewards (usually) of the flashback. Pretty elegant.</p>

              <p>Leverage supposedly was a gsme that really pushed flashbacks, which makes sense because the series did too, but I’ve never played it.</p>
<p>Dungeon World does this slightly with its Adventuring Gear (3 uses, you have what you need because you must have put it there beforehand).</p>
