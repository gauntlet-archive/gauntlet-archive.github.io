    <description>**This is a one-shot of *Alice is Missing* , set on the date that the game actually takes place!**

## **About *Alice is Missing***

***Alice is Missing***  *is a silent role-playing game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town of Silent Falls.*

*The game is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren’t in the same place together.*

*Haunting beautiful, deeply personal, and highly innovative,*  ***Alice is Missing***  *puts a strong focus on the emotional engagement between players, immersing them in a tense, dramatic mystery that unfolds organically through the text messages they send to one another.*

In the game, Alice was last seen on December 19th, and gameplay takes place on the 22nd. While those are a Wednesday and Saturday in the year that the game takes place, we&#39;re sticking with the dates (in the western hemisphere, at least!).

## **Subject Matter Warning**

* This game inherently deals with topics like missing children, tense family dynamics, grief, death, violence, and helplessness. Safety tools will be used.

## **Notes**

* This is a GM-less game, though I will facilitate and teach as well as play along.
* No experience is required, game and tools will be taught.
* We&#39;ll be using Discord for pre-game discussion, gameplay (using a bot to facilitate), and debrief. Video and/or voice chat will be used only for pre- and post-game discussion.
