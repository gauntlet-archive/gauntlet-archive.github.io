          <p><strong>This is a one-shot of <em>Alice is Missing</em> , set on the date that the game actually takes place!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>About <em>Alice is Missing</em></strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Alice is Missing</strong></em>  <em>is a silent role-playing game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town of Silent Falls.</em></p>
<p><em>The game is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren’t in the same place together.</em></p>
<p><em>Haunting beautiful, deeply personal, and highly innovative,</em>  <em><strong>Alice is Missing</strong></em>  <em>puts a strong focus on the emotional engagement between players, immersing them in a tense, dramatic mystery that unfolds organically through the text messages they send to one another.</em></p>
<p>In the game, Alice was last seen on December 19th, and gameplay takes place on the 22nd. While those are a Wednesday and Saturday in the year that the game takes place, we’re sticking with the dates (in the western hemisphere, at least!).</p>
<h2><strong>Subject Matter Warning</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>This game inherently deals with topics like missing children, tense family dynamics, grief, death, violence, and helplessness. Safety tools will be used.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a GM-less game, though I will facilitate and teach as well as play along.</li>
<li>No experience is required, game and tools will be taught.</li>
<li>We’ll be using Discord for pre-game discussion, gameplay (using a bot to facilitate), and debrief. Video and/or voice chat will be used only for pre- and post-game discussion.</li>
