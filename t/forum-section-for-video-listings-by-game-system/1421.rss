    <description>while The Gauntlet does a good job of advertising videos of game sessions when they come out, we really dont have any listings where we can look back over past games.

Would a section of the forum where we can posts compiled lists of games series by system be of interest to folk?

(eg, having a threat for Monsterhearts, a thread for World Wide Wrestling, a thread for Hearts of Wulin ect)

that way if somebody wants to look for actual plays of a specific games, we have them listed in a easy to find format.</description>

              <p>Oh yeah…everything I’m picturing is from the perspective of something outside the Forums. I mean it’s basically just a UI over an RDBMS. (I mean…isn’t everything.)

Like I said…just an idea that’s been in my “someday” pile, but maybe it’s time to dust it off. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>This is all just speculative, but I think one-shot vs. series, GMless or GMed, maybe by number of players or even particular participants. Plus, imagine if videos were linked to game records in a database kind of way and being able to search on game characteristics. Diceless, say, or “X plus hacks of X.” I think it would be kinda cool!</p>

              <p>Hi, all. Sorry for being late to this particular convo! For sure the closest thing we have to this currently is, as was mentioned earlier, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TheGauntletRPG/playlists?sort=lad&amp;flow=grid&amp;view=1" rel="nofollow noopener">Playlists section of the YouTube channel</a>, which (broadly) categorizes the videos by game system. Exceptions (and sometimes duplications) are for games bound in other special ways like Gauntlet Con games or Star Wars Saturdays.</p>
<p>I would be <em>thrilled</em> with a wiki-like resource (which would also allow for slicing the games along all sorts of different axes besides system), and just from having compiled the weekly roundups, I should have a fair amount of data that could be front-loaded into such a system. So there’s that, and once an established structure is in place, maintaining it could hopefully be rolled into the weekly roundup process.</p>
<p>TL;DR I’m highly in favor of a more archive-like resource for video listing, and hopefully could contribute to the seed data and future maintenance. I’d definitely be interested in this project down the road.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I think that’s a great resource and worth approaching. It feels like a project for down the road to create something easy and accessible for users, wiki or something else, so they can easily search and locate certain games (Monsterhearts, Legacy, etc) from across the Gauntlet’s multi-year history. It is a common question (Are there AP videos for X?) and its been a useful source of engagement for the community, with users finding us via those videos.</p>

              <p>the blog is an excellent way of listing the new games out each week but i’m not sure searching it is the most user friendly interface for listing games like that.</p>
<p>Part of the advantage of the forums is that rather than having posts with individual videos, posters can edit the previous posts so all that videos for a particular run/game series are in one place.</p>
<p>but yes, wiki functionality is a better route for that.</p>

              <p>Absolutely-- Rob’s done amazing work with that. However that only gives us an archive reaching back to mid-2018. It’d be great to have something covering 2016, 207, and the rest of 2018’s videos as well. There’s lots of good stuff there.</p>

              <p>We can look them up on the <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog" rel="nofollow noopener">blog</a>! Just put the name of the system in the search bar and you’ll find the posts Rob makes every week. I did that just yesterday to find some Trophy APs. If it’s a multi-worded system name, you can just put it in quotes, like “Rhapsody of Blood” so you don’t get all of the posts that have “of” in them</p>

              <p>There <em>is</em> wiki functionality for posts. We haven’t broken it out yet but this could be use for it? The question of course becomes who does the work? In theory as you play your series you post the vids on your series’ thread in <a class="hashtag" href="/c/6-gauntlet-hangouts">#<span>gauntlet-hangouts</span></a>. Are you the game runner in charge of then adding them to the wiki? Or do we find volunteers to do that? Same question for the back catalog…</p>
<p>Totally open to ideas!</p>

              <p>I wonder if that’s something better done with a wiki? I don’t know what kinds of tools the forum has that would help with something like that. It’s a good issue and given that I crank these out it would be good to find a long window tool to organize and help folks find these.</p>

              <p>while The Gauntlet does a good job of advertising videos of game sessions when they come out, we really dont have any listings where we can look back over past games.</p>
<p>Would a section of the forum where we can posts compiled lists of games series by system be of interest to folk?</p>
<p>(eg, having a threat for Monsterhearts, a thread for World Wide Wrestling, a thread for Hearts of Wulin ect)</p>
<p>that way if somebody wants to look for actual plays of a specific games, we have them listed in a easy to find format.</p>
