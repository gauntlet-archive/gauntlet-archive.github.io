    <title>Undertake a Perilous Journey - Which player to roll?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/undertake-a-perilous-journey-which-player-to-roll/3143</link>
    <description>Still getting to grips with the rules and looking for some tips.  If I have a party about to take a journey, how do I pick who should roll the move dice as the trailblazer for Undertake a Perilous Journey?

It might be obvious, like the player with a sailor background makes the roll if it was a sea journey or the druid makes the roll if it was a mostly forest trip etc.  However is there is no obvious party member with experience of the kind of journey ahead is it just a case of saying &quot;Who is going to trail-blaze this journey and roll the move&quot;? Then let the players decide who makes the roll and who does the other tasks? 

On a related note can a fourth player aid one of the 3 PC&#39;s taking the  Undertake a Perilous Journey move?</description>

              <p>Yup, let them pick. And remember, “to do it, you have to do it”: get them to describe <em>how</em> they scout ahead or whatever, just like any other move.</p>

<p>Yup! This is exactly right.</p>
<p>As for aiding, yeah, totally possible to let one player Aid another. Just be sure to ask <em>how</em> they are helping, and that everyone agrees it’d be feasible and helpful.</p>
<p>Technically, there’s no reason the PC fulfilling one roll can’t Aid another… the Scout could Aid the Trailblazer by pouring over the map with him and discussing the course they want to set. From a practical standpoint, though, I’d probably limit Aiding to folks not doing another job. It could easily end up with three players each making two rolls, and that gets ugly.</p>
