    <title>Suggestions for a gateway game to tempt Secondary students from D&amp;D</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/suggestions-for-a-gateway-game-to-tempt-secondary-students-from-d-d/8566</link>
    <description>I teach high school.  I&#39;ve recently moved to a school with a well established RPG club, but it&#39;s all D&amp;D, and nothing else.  But I know that a couple of my students would really enjoy the more narrative style of game.  I&#39;m wondering what you might recommend as a good game to use to showcase the differences.  Keep in mind these are students at a school, ages 13-16; so Monsterhearts and the like are not gonna fly.

I&#39;m not too enthused with Dungeon World, it seems to close to D&amp;D, among other factors. Another fantasy game is fine.

I curious what folks think is best, and why.

Cheers!

Edit: I&#39;m pretty familiar with PBTA and FITD &quot;rulesets&quot; so I&#39;d likely stick to those (not a lot of time to take on new system mastery these days).</description>

              <p>I was going to suggest a Forged in the Dark gameScum and Villainy is a great call. I second that. it’s mechanically very different, which encourages players top look with new eyes at the D&amp;D ruleset.<br>
I would also definitely recommend Last Fleet and Brindlewood Bay. Both are very good implementations of Powered by the Apocalypse.<br>
For a solid rules lite game ICERPG (Index Card RPG) can be used to do a good nockabout SciFi game.<br>
If you want a system with more crunch, Stars Without Number is very well designed.</p>

<p>Say no more!<br>
I suggest, to no ones’s surprise, <strong>Fantasy World</strong> <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
The SRD @ <em><strong><a href="http://fantasyworldrpg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">fantasyworldrpg.com</a></strong></em> is free and contains 100% of the game rules.<br>
Typos and bad formatting are included in the price, but I’m slowly working on that <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"><br>
Besides, the commercial PDFs by MS Edizioni have just arrived to the KS backers and should soon be available for purchase, should one wish for an insanely nicer reading experience <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>The SRD intro provides a handy TL:DR section about all the core points that make FW different from D&amp;D and DW, so be sure to check that out to see if this game is what you are looking for.<br>
And for any further questions, I’m at your disposale here on the forum <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>It’s outside of the PbtA/FitD realm, but my son (9) enjoys Dungeon Crawl Classics. It is very “like D&amp;D”, but less corporate and more weird. Possibly inappropriate for a school setting, since it’s pretty overt about “wizard make deals with demons” and stuff.</p>
<p>How about Scum and Villainy? That’s FitD, and kids would all be familiar with Star Wars as a touchstone, and possibly Firefly or Cowboy Bebop. Rogues and space seems like an easy sell.</p>

              <p>What about something like Slugblaster? It’s forged in the dark in a zany universe where teens group together to run interdimensional journeys to battle monsters. I think the aesthetic might be more nostalgic for a time that contemporary high schoolers might not understand tho.</p>
<p>Alternatively I think Mausritter is an interesting OSR-type game where you play mice with the natural problems that an anthropomorphic mouse might have. I think there’s a free option on <a href="http://itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">itch.io</a></p>
