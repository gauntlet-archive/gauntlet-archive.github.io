*From the worm’s coils to the Golden Throne, all knew of her displeasure. Careless words of tyrant make a travesty of even the greatest sacrifice.*

*For King Oeneus’s impiety: his people will suffer*

*No more kingdom, no more Calydon.*

*To plow the fields of Her new primordial domain, a beast of prodigious might delivered. A forest from a city.*

The Calydonian Boar is a Greek Myth inspired game of epic heroes and their demise at the hands of a monster. Players will each play multiple hunters, who all have been sent to kill the Calydonian Boar. Likely only a select few will survive.

This is a one-shot. The game will take place over Zoom and will be recorded and shared on YouTube with player permission.

The Calydonian Boar was published in Codex: Blood 3. The rules will be taught at the beginning of the session and no prior knowledge is necessary.

## Safety Tools

We will be using script change, x-card, lines and veils, and an open door policy. All of these tools will be explained at the start of the session. This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
