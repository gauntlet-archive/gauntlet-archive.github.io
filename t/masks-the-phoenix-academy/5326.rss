    <title>Masks: The Phoenix Academy</title>

    <description>Posting my debut run of Masks: A New Generation...

Players will portray new students at the Phoenix Academy, the preeminent school for young supers.

The training will be intense, perhaps even brutal. The headmaster is a sorcerer who spent the last few decades in a demon&#39;s possession. Half the teachers are rehabilitating villains. And your fellow students will crush you to be recognized as the mightiest heroes of a new generation.

You may use the basic playbooks as well as the Reformed (an ex-villain), the Scion (child of a villain), and the Soldier (an undercover agent sent by A.E.G.I.S. to monitor the Academy).

Safety tools to be used: X-Card, lines and veils, Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.

Attendance at each session is appreciated but not required. Please RSVP for every session you attend.

With player approval, sessions will be recorded and posted.

[DELETE BEFORE SUBMISSION: Post links to your calendared game, its info, etc. Then when the video is ready, link to it in the thread. Use the Insert Date function (in the little gear drop down) to have date/time show up appropriate to the viewer&#39;s time zone.]
