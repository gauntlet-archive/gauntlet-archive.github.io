Is anyone planning to create something for it?

I&#39;ll be writing up my notes for a site called *Recluse of the Piper* where a hermit once collaborated with an extraplanar cephalopod in the creation of a psionic poison. Not yet sure if I&#39;ll have stats for **Troika!** with it or append a tiny new ruleset to make use of my new d3</description>

              <p>Running this at basically the same time as the One Page Dungeon Contest seems… I dunno… like inviting unnecessary drama… or something? Like, my first reaction should have been “awesome, a new contest for short term stuff!”. Instead, it was “why would they launch this simultaneous with the One Page Dungeon Contest?” and then I sort of forgot about it.</p>
