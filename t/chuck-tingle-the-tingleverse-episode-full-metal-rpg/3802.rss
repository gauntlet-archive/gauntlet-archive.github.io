    <description>Hello Everyone,

My name is Brendan and I host a roleplaying game discussion podcast called Full Metal RPG.

I love to follow the work of Chuck Tingle, and so when he released &quot;The Tingleverse&quot; RPG I was an early adopter. My friend Richard who is also a member of the Gauntlet community and co-host of the show encouraged me to reach out to Chuck and invite him on the show to talk about the game.

I did just that, and I&#39;m so happy how it turned out! I guess that&#39;s the power of asking! Chuck came on and talked about the game and how Love is Real. I hope that you will take a second and listen to the episode, I have it linked for you below. Thanks for reading!
