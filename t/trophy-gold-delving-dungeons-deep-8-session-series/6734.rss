    <description>*Struggling to meet your financial obligations, you have become a treasure-hunter that explores ancient crypts, forgotten vaults, and lost caverns. It&#39;s a dangerous job but... you have pretty much run out of other options.*

***Trophy Gold*** is a dark fantasy RPG about desperate treasure-hunters seeking riches in forgotten places. It&#39;s Old School role-playing using a modern lightweight narrative-focused ruleset.

No experience is necessary: All rules will be taught at the table.

This is an eight-part series running Thursdays at 8:00 PM EDT (UTC-4). Attendance in all sessions is encouraged, but not required: You must sign up for each individual session. Sessions will run three hours.

In this series, I intend to run the treasure-hunters through two or three incursions, with a Hearthfire downtime round after each. The specific incursions I intend to run are: *The Godsmouth Heresy, The Temple of the Peerless Star,* and *The Bruja, the Beast, and the Barrow.*

**Content Warnings:** These incursions include themes of death, interment, tragic love, medical experiments, undeath, serpents, and betrayal.

**Safety Tools:** We will be using Open Door, the X-Card, and Lines &amp; Veils.

**Technology:** We will be using the GM&#39;s Zoom for video chat, a shared Character Keeper on Google Docs, and RollWithMe as a shared dice roller. While I find it easier to GM when player cameras are on, that is absolutely not a requirement.

**Recording:** With enthusiastic consent from the players, I would like to record the sessions for personal review. If the players enthusiastically agree, I will post the videos for public viewing.

**Breaks:** We will take a 5- or 10-minute break at roughly the top of each hour, plus any additional breaks as requested.
