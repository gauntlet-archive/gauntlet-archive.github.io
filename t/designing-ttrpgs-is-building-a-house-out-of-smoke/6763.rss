    <description>Hello,
In the spirit of this thread, a simple question to plumb the depth of the unknown
https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/everything-is-a-designable-surface/840
What is TTRPG design like ? 

frex : 
It&#39;s like weaving a bridge between a small sample of humanity and into a psycho-cultural landscape.
It&#39;s like connecting ducts and pumps roughly similar to what I see others do, and try and guess where to insert what in order to get anything meaningful out.
It&#39;s like building a model ship, rigging and all : now that it&#39;s done, I just need to find a bottle big enough... err, wait... duh !</description>

<p>Sometimes, it helps to look at your game in a structured way. These are some ways of thinking about your game that I've found useful. They're basically a way to focus your thoughts on one specific asp</p>

              <p>I often think of writing an RPG as building a bridge between the fiction and the game mechanics. People always ask if you should start with the fiction or the mechanics first when designing a game. In practice it doesn’t matter that much. For a well-built bridge, you can’t tell which shore of the river they started building from, so long as the path between them is easy to navigate.</p>
