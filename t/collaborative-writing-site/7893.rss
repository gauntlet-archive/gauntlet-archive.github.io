    <description>Hello,
I am looking for ways to hijack the internet.
Inspired by SCP, this collaborative writing blog is a first baby step, but I&#39;d like to have more functionalities (multilingual, member authored posts, etc.) for free and not much work. 
https://openyouhou-blogspot-com.translate.goog/p/a-propos.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=es&amp;_x_tr_hl=en

I&#39;m also looking for ways to mimick sites such as Craig&#39;s list (classified ads) or Marmiton (cooking recipes), but hitting the wall of authorship when I&#39;d like anybody to be able to open a post. I&#39;ve seen people create games around a Twitter hashtag (but don&#39;t use Twitter myself). 

Any ideas for implementing stuff like that ?

(Once I find the right format, I&#39;d like to start a &quot;citizen evaluation site&quot;, a dystopian version of TripAdvisor where you rate your fellow citizens. The point, as always, is to collectively draw an implied world. But i think I can probably do this with SCP...)</description>

              <p>I don’t know SCP (to me it means ‘secure copy’) so I had to look it up. I guess you mean the Secure Contain Protect collaborative writing project. It uses a wiki to do its collaborative writing. Specifically they use the <a href="https://www.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.wikidot.com/</a> hosting service. They offer free accounts and offer very generous terms to “quality community wikis” – I don’t know what they mean by “quality” here.</p>
<p>Hope that helps to get you started.</p>
<p>PS: the link in your post is either wrong or completely failing to convey what you mean.</p>
