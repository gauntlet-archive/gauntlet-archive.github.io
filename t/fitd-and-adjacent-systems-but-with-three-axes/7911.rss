    <description>Beyond action rating (which is intrinsic to the character), *Forged in the Dark* games measure actions on two axis - **position** and **effect**.

Now, I&#39;ve always struggled with this, because there&#39;s no acknowledgement of difficulty. (I&#39;m aware that you can fold difficulty into position - if you&#39;re good, the difficult stuff is less risky, but that&#39;s not how my mind works or my table flows.)

The FitD-adjacent game *Wildsea*, and the *Resistance* system (*Heart* and *Spire*) both forgo **position** for **difficulty** (while keeping **effect**). I like this, but now I miss **position**. Difficulty actually lowers your dice - you *can&#39;t* achieve something wondrous if you&#39;re not skilled enough, and those with enough skill still suffer a real risk. (This is contrary to FitD, where if you&#39;re rolling 4d6, you&#39;ve got a ~94% chance of success no matter what you do, and a greater than 50% chance of success without cost.)

Is it feasible to run a game with all three axis - **position**, **difficulty**, and **effect**? Or is that too much?</description>

              <p>Well, I tried it once (and not even for whole session) to try three axis setup as I was interested too and… It is unviable. From the theory perspective it is super, it allows adjustment of virtually every meaningful element of the test. From practical point of view it os too much.</p>
<p>I must say I had players who had hard time jumping from one-axis-traditional to two-axes-blades, cannot even imagine how big of a leap would be going to make it to three axes.</p>
<p>It is just too much to keep in mind at the moment. Too many things to decide from GM perspective and too many things to adjust from player side. It prolongs the time to roll significantly. I can only imagine it could work if you simplify the choices and make it very thematic game, something like PbtA genre-focus-moves. So you are prompt with fixed move and just adjust +1/-1 effect, position and difficulty.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, but why does it have to be like that?</p>
<p>When I created a BRP system (roll 1d20, equal or lower than a value is a success), I also added a diceless mechanic where I just decided a difficulty and if anyone had an appropriate skill compared to that value, they would succeed. I mostly used this for social, reactive (listen, detect danger) and knowledge skills.</p>
<p>After a few years, I realized that there were no real difference between me deciding on a difficulty on a scale between 1-20 and rolling a d20. I realized that the actual roll only stated the difficulty, rather than stating if the roll is a success or not. Determine success only happens <em>when</em> you <em>compare</em> the roll with a value.</p>
<p>So when reading <strong>BitD</strong>, that’s how i interpret the dice system: you have risk, you have reward (position), and you have difficulty (die roll). I mean, not even <strong>PbtA</strong> have difficulty, other than possibly the clock. And even that exists in Blades. So in a way, you got <em>two</em> ways of interpret difficulty.</p>

<p>in my game <em>October Rust</em> (with many solutions from FitD), diffculty of a main roll depends on the scale of the intent. How much do you want to achieve, to change? More impact from a conflict = more difficult (more resources to spend).</p>
<p>How to translate it into FitD Engine? You could make the Action Roll harder, when the Effect is better. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make Effect larger than Standard/Default, you need to pay someting or use resources. Something, which feels differently than “push yourself for +1 effect” in BitD.</li>
<li>Separate the Scale/Magnitude from factoring into Effect. Then, make the decisions for a character: if they want to make something difficult (because of oversize/overscale), they need to achieve leverage for that (special abilities, succesfull Linked Test, gaining enough people to do with it, etc). OR accept -1D/-[x amount]D to roll.</li>
<li>Many FitD games  already have -1D and +1D answers in various Fortune (but Important) Rolls: Engagements, Calamity Roll and so on. You can make difficulty axis by forcing a player to answer those questions before they roll.</li>

              <p>Sure, but you’ll have the added cost of another axis to explain to the players (including the GM), and one more thing to adjudicate for each roll. While I’m sympathetic to the end goal, I’m not sure the system can carry that weight without becoming overly cumbersome.</p>
<p>I think I would try to find some other way to achieve the same goal. If not changing the results table, then limiting the number of dice a player can roll, using dice with more faces to make the best roll less likely, or something else that doesn’t increase the handling cost for every action.</p>

              <p>Mechanically, I would see it breaking down as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Effect</strong> measures what happens on your successes (more or less fictional result, more or fewer checks on a clock)</li>
<li>
<strong>Position</strong> measures what happens on your failures/consequences (more or less harm, for example)</li>
<li>
<strong>Difficulty</strong> would alter the number of dice you roll. (Both <em>Wildsea</em> and <em>Spire</em>/<em>Heart</em> just have you remove the highest rolling 1 or 2 dice from the pool, so you can’t have a clear success with a single 6.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the fiction, I’ve always struggled with the idea of trying to measure “difficulty” with <strong>position</strong>, which I think should measure “risk” - those are, in my mind, two different things. Attempting to jump a narrow chasm should be <em>easier</em> than jumping a wide chasm. Jumping a deep chasm should be <em>riskier</em> than jumping a shallow one. One measures the likelihood of success, the other measures the risk of failure.</p>
<p>Though I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/dereel">@DeReel</a> - it may just be too much, which is why I prompted the question.</p>
<p>One option might be to leave position out mechanically, and just have it come out in the conversation. Don’t label <em>controlled</em>, <em>risky</em>, and <em>desperate</em>. But, the GM can say things like “Ooph, that chasm is really deep, if you fail you’re looking at 3-4 harm.” versus “You’ve made this jump a hundred times. Not while being shot at, mind you, but if you fail your roll you’re not falling in or anything.”</p>

              <p>I wonder how <strong>“difficulty”</strong> would work out, as a third axis (or shift) of a roll. Does increasing/reducing it would change the scope of the action? Then, you have <strong>effect</strong> for it. Harder difficulty, harder consequences of making it? Then, you have <strong>position</strong> for it.</p>
<p>Harder difficulty, harder initial cost of rolling Action Roll? Well, that would become interesting, if the game demaded you to pay for making actions…</p>
<p>If you mean “difficulty” by changing dice ranges, then it’s not really and axis, more like impediment (or empowerment). I already saw some heartbreaker projects at BitD Discord server, which tried to utilize the concept of changed resolution ranges (like 1-2/3-4/5-6 or 1-4/5/6). Another way was to change one (or all) of the dice to either d8 (to make much higher chances for 4+ and 6+) or to d4 (no chance for 6+, unless special “crit-like” rules exists to escalate “4s” for instance).</p>

              <p>In theory nothing prevents it. I would find 3 parameters to adjust too much like a game of whack-the-mole. Two is already a lot of négociation to me. I’d have an easier time translating position into difficulty.<br>
The wondrous effect is already included in Effect so, here again, I’d agree on a new scale of Effect and voila.<br>

              <p>Beyond action rating (which is intrinsic to the character), <em>Forged in the Dark</em> games measure actions on two axis - <strong>position</strong> and <strong>effect</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve always struggled with this, because there’s no acknowledgement of difficulty. (I’m aware that you can fold difficulty into position - if you’re good, the difficult stuff is less risky, but that’s not how my mind works or my table flows.)</p>
<p>The FitD-adjacent game <em>Wildsea</em>, and the <em>Resistance</em> system (<em>Heart</em> and <em>Spire</em>) both forgo <strong>position</strong> for <strong>difficulty</strong> (while keeping <strong>effect</strong>). I like this, but now I miss <strong>position</strong>. Difficulty actually lowers your dice - you <em>can’t</em> achieve something wondrous if you’re not skilled enough, and those with enough skill still suffer a real risk. (This is contrary to FitD, where if you’re rolling 4d6, you’ve got a ~94% chance of success no matter what you do, and a greater than 50% chance of success without cost.)</p>
<p>Is it feasible to run a game with all three axis - <strong>position</strong>, <strong>difficulty</strong>, and <strong>effect</strong>? Or is that too much?</p>
