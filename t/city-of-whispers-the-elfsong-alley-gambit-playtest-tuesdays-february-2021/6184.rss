    <description>## The Story

As soon as you turn the corner, you know you’ve made a mistake. Your companions sense it, too, their hands seeking the comfort of their weapons’ hilts. This contact of yours, Bazh’gnor, you’ve known for years, but this is the first time they’ve asked to meet anywhere other than their shop. In truth, this whole thing stank from the beginning. The moment you got that note-- 

But the trap is sprung: four bandits fall gracefully from ledges above, landing nearly noiselessly around your group. The leader, her face in shadow, says, “Welcome to Elfsong Alley. First time in this part of town?” It takes a moment, but you realize know that voice. You say, “Eleanor. Cousin Eleanor?” You hear a stifled gurgle from the shadowed face, and you can’t resist. “Auntie tells me it’s been three weeks since she’s seen either hide or hair of you.”

## The Pitch

City of Whispers is a city fantasy game, powered by the Apocalypse, currently in development. This will be the first major play test.

Players assume the role of city denizens in a world filled with dangerous magic, political intrigue, and personal entanglements.

In addition to generating characters, the first session entails creating the city and its factions.

## Caveat

This game is currently in development. This is a play test. We will likely encounter issues with the rules, but I will make sure everyone has fun.
