Your racing team has reached the elite level and you compete in a circuit across several planets in Zsinj&#39;s Empire. Little do those imperials know that you&#39;re actually secretly part of the New Republic. Along each stop, you help out rebel cells and take down imperial strongholds, if you can. And before they realize who&#39;s pantsed them, you travel on to the next race.

-----------------------------------

*What is the velocity of justice? Many say it’s difficult to quantify-- that it even evades common metrics of measurement or full understanding by the rule of law. One thing’s for sure, however: you should be able to gauge it as it comes hurtling towards you. Hands grip steering wheels as rubber grips concrete. Seedy underbellies trade bullets with the law and set moral shades of gray ablaze. Napalm and nitrous are as indispensable as your ability to hack or maneuver cold machinery.*

**Justice Velocity**  is an action movie-themed tabletop role-playing game for 3+ players. 

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and will be added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).
