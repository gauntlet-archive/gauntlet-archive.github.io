<p>I am totally hooked onto <b>Pasión de las Pasiones</b>! The project by Brandon Leon-Gambetta, which from my understanding is realized with the help of Magpie Games. Anyway, the game focuses on the unique kind of drama Latin-American ans Spanish telenovelas. Next to those it offeres telenovela takes on the Mafia genre like La Reina del Sûr as well as highstakes vampire &amp; supernatural drama. I got the Ashcan at GenCon 2018, I am enamored with the concept and backed it with enthusiasm. Check it out! <b>The Midnight World</b> on the other hand approaches way more serious and heavy topics. It explores the themes of anxiety and PTSD in a world in which monsters are real. The fact that mental issues are approached more complex and in depth, not reducing it to a „healthy“ and „broken“ dichtonomy but allowing a „wounded“ state, than can be found in most other urban fantasy games differentiates it in an interesting and enticing way. I have met the author James Davey at various US WoD Larp conventions and trust him as well as his team. Which might get enlarged with several WoD alumini like Jason Andrews and Jennifer Smith-Pulsipher – depending on the stretch goals. I am quite fascinated by the project and tempted to back it. Take a look, and consider it, please. If you prefer a way more whimsical, fantastic approach, you should take a look at the <b>Dungeon Master Saga</b>. If I understood the project correctly, the tarot and d6 based game, enables your character to fight with extremly escalating means. Like summoning dragons or turning an ally into a planet to drop onto a fiend. The illustrations looks nice and the concept is quite interesting. If you are a fan of the <b>The Magitech Chronicles</b> books by Chris Fox, you have to check out the kickstarter by the same name. Judging by the thumbnail it offers dragons in a quite fascinating Science Fiction setting. It uses the Catalyst enging for its game systems. Maybe your SciFi needs has you rather wonder „What, if Fallout, but with 90s instead of Atomic Punk“. <b>What Remains</b> basically delivers that. The world went kinda belly up thanks to the Y2K bug things, and now you got all the mutant, zombie fun with some SF elements and extra thick 90s nostalgia. Which makes me feel kinda old. Like people who see younglings playing Fallout but having lived through the 50s. <b>Colony: SALEM</b> doesn’t offer challenges like that. It’s a Science Fiction game which has you colonize worlds as Neo-Puritans. As such you will face mysteries as well as questions of betrayal and faith. The game is PbtA based and is interesting. Well, and then there is the <b>GMD CORE RPG, </b>a universal game system, that will enable you to play in various genres and settings, take a look.<br>
The gamebook <b>DRACULA – Curse of the Vampire</b> by Jonathan Green caught my eye as I am a fan of vampire and of his previous work Alice’s Nightmare in Wonderland! The book appears sound, fun and classy. I did manage to get the day-1 reward and highly recommend you take a look. The book is fabulous.<br>
There are other projects like <b>The Little Game Master: Of Bards and Bullies</b>, a mix of a novel and a supplement to a kidfriend D&amp;D style game. I really like the design of the quite sparkly <b>SkullSplitter Dice 2020</b> and if the <b>Multicolor Frenzy Dice</b> were d10 I might have backed if. If you are looking for a really, really nice GM-screen and dice tower, you have to have a look at <b>Dragon Templ8 – ARTIFACTS</b>! I am almost tempted.<br>
