    <description>[Is #hype the right channel for this?]

There&#39;s this and other **forums**. There&#39;s RPG-related **Slack groups** and **Discord servers**. There&#39;s hundreds of **podcasts**. Anyone know if there&#39;s a good weekly or monthly delivered-to-your-inbox **newsletter** (like from TinyLetter.com) about tabletop RPGs?</description>

              <p>This may be wandering from what you were asking, but I feel it’s worth noting that for design process and analysis, I generally think of blogs first, which admittedly are usually more single-perspective things than multifaceted discussions like you’d find on a forum. But I bring it up because many blogs allow you to subscribe via email if you’re not into using a newsreader, so the mechanism is at least similar even if the format is not.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the response! These are great to get me started. I’m not sure I had anything in particular in mind – though I do like getting insights into the design process and dissecting mechanics. I subscribe to newsletters for other things in my life, but not for RPGs, which is why I was asking. (Though, now that you mention it, I do get DiceGeeeks.)</p>

              <p>Any particular type of info you’re interested in? I enjoy <em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/moreseatsrpg" rel="nofollow noopener">More Seats at the Table</a></em> for seeing new products coming out and crowfunding campaigns and stuff like that. (It’s Patreon-funded, but the newsletter is free; there’s a signup link on the front of the Patreon page.) Johnn Four has been running <em><a href="https://www.roleplayingtips.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Roleplaying Tips</a></em> for <em>years</em> now, and you can get that by email. <em><a href="https://tabletopbellhop.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Tabletop Bellhop</a></em> has a weekly newsletter; it leans toward board games, but there’s occasional RPG news and such. <em><a href="https://www.dicegeeks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Dicegeeks</a></em> has a mailing list and they frequently include free fantasy city maps and random tables and stuff like that. I may remember more as things show up in my inbox. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So the short answer is “yes,” but was there something in particular you were looking for?</p>
