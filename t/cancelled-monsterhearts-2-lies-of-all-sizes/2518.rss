**These sessions have been cancelled.**

You were safe for a time, making a home on Mandrake Lane. Whenever someone got suspicious, Brenda would use that hypnotic gaze of hers and people would just forget whatever they weren’t supposed to know. But Brenda is gone now and the only thing keeping your secrets from getting out are how well you can control yourself. The facade of upscale normalcy is fragile and in between white picket fences and closed doors, who’s to say what will happen if you’re anything less than perfect… 

*Lies of All Sizes* is a framework for Monsterhearts 2 that puts the game in the setting of suburban thrillers like *Desperate Housewives, Big Little Lies,* and *Pretty Little Liars*. It takes place in an aggressively quaint little town whose thin veneer of perfection hides a dark underbelly of secrets and scandals. 

You must RSVP to each session you want to play in. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged, but not required. Rules will be taught. Sessions run 2.5 to 3 hours. Sessions will take place via Hangouts On Air and will be recorded for later posting (subject to change with recent Hangouts On Air sunsetting). 

A very limited selection of Skins is available for the players as well as pre-generated characters to go with these Skins if the players so decide. It is more than acceptable if players want to alter some aspects of these characters to better fit their play style.

In session one we will talk about the tone we want—the PG13 melodrama of The CW or the grittier R-rated version from HBO. We will establish lines &amp; veils, and go over our safety tools each session. [The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.

Content Warning: These sessions will address issues common to societal expectations of domesticity and adult relationships in addition to the drama inherent to Monsterhearts. This framework also begins with a mystery surrounding the suicide of an NPC.

I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. If you sign up and your ability to attend changes, please also send me a message via slack or email.
