This is a one-shot session reskinning *Before the Storm* by Joanna Piancastelli from Pelgrane&#39;s *Seven Wonders* collection of rpgs. The original tells the story of a group of adventurers recalling their stories on the eve of a final conflict with a terrible foe. Our version will reset this into a superhero story with a misfit team of supers getting ready to face a reality-shaking foe. You can see my write-up of the reskin here: **[https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-before-the-endgame](http://)**. We will define our own heroes and setting. 

Open RSVPs begin 1/12

CW: tragedy, loss, betrayal

The session will last four hours with several breaks. We will be using a Google spreadsheet and an online playing card web app. In the first part of the session we will create characters based on card prompts. In the last hour we will resolve what happens during the final battle. Our session will follow the Gauntlet Code of Conduct and we will be using Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and other tools for safety. We will be playing using Zoom and I will send out materials and a link several days before the session. If your schedule changes, please drop from the sign up and send me an email.
