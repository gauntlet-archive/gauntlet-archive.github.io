You can find the game here: https://willjobst.itch.io/ghosts

This session is scheduled for 3 hours. I will email everyone three days ahead to confirm attendance. Sessions will not be recorded, because of the unique nature of the game.

**NOTE: This game requires the use of discord.** There will be no video, only players who are &quot;investigators&quot; will be on voice chat, ghosts will only type. So expect a very different game style from what we&#39;re used to!

***this discord has ghosts in it*** is a game of entering and exploring a haunted house filled with ghosts. that haunted house is a discord. 

in this game, players are either **investigators** or **ghosts** .
