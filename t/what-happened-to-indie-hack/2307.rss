    <description>I have been looking for RPGs that mixes OSR with story games. I remembered reading about Indie Hack once. When I try to find it on Drivethru RPG, it is not there anymore. Does anyone know what happened?</description>

              <p>The lack of DTRPG and <a href="http://itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">itch.io</a> sales pages is part of a long and complex tale involving visa statuses that I won’t bore you with. I would only take them down if I were essentially forced to.</p>
<p>At the moment, IPR is a great way to get a hold of the game! (Thanks, <a class="mention" href="/u/asher">@Asher</a>!)</p>
<p>As to a possible second edition, <a class="mention" href="/u/neurotrash">@Neurotrash</a>, I can neither confirm nor deny such claims. What I can say is, TIH2 is not on the front burner for Scablands Press (there are… three? ish… other things closer to being ready).</p>
<p>(Sidenote: These blips of interest warm my heart!)</p>

              <p>That’s weird they took it down. It’s neat little game with some cool ideas, a lot of which are imminently portable to other rpgs. (I even bought the hard copy…though I can never find it on my shelf because it’s so thin)</p>
<p>Do you think they’re working on a 2nd Edition or something?</p>

              <p>It looks like the publisher, Scablands Press, removed their works from DTRPG and <a href="http://itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">itch.io</a>. You can still buy the <a href="https://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/The-Indie-Hack.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Indie Hack through IPR</a> (and they have the SRD available like <a class="mention" href="/u/shane">@shane</a> mentioned).</p>
