    <title>Cartel: Asesinato Vagabundos</title>

    <description>Life in Durango is tough when you&#39;re a part of the Sinaloa Cartel. From the top down its a game that&#39;s not to be taken lightly. Unfortunately, for some, there&#39;s no other game in town. This will be more a &quot;slice of life&quot; theme, people going about their day... Cooking up meth, snuffing enemies of the Cartel, trying not to be the star of Los Zetas latest grisly revenge video. Life&#39;s a bitch, hopefully you don&#39;t die.

Cartel is a TTRPG about the members of the Sinaloa Drug Cartel in Mexico. You can take on the role of the Mob Boss, an Assassin, a Drug Cooker, a Dirty Cop, and more. It&#39;s about the hard decisions you have to make to stay afloat in the War on Drugs. Cartel is meant to tread difficult ground, addiction, hyper violence, verbal abuse are its built into the themes and moves of the game. If you&#39;re not comfortable with those themes please note it will be hard to work around them in the fiction of the game.

Gameplay themes: violence, addiction/alcoholism, verbal/emotional abuse, bullying, corrupt policing.
Possible themes: extreme violence, gore, body horror, 
Default Lines: sexual assault, homophobia, transphobia, racism, domestic violence
Default Veils: sex, kink, harm to domestic animals, harm to children

At-a-Glance
System: Cartel
Schedule: Four Tuesdays in June, 3 hour sessions
Breaks: Two 10-minute breaks
Venue: Streamyards and Roll20
Attendance: Joining all four sessions is ideal but not required
Safety: Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, Open Table, and any others suggested by the players

For the first 36 hours please limit sign ups to new Gauntlet members, or people who haven&#39;t been able to get into a game. I want to give people who dont get first dibs a chance to play. I&#39;m also holding a seat for a player.
