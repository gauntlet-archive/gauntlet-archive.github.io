    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-1-of-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 1 of 3, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/09 and 02/19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Following my operation this collection is a bit delayed, and thanks to the zine quest it totals more than 150 projects of whom more than 70 are actual games. Thus I decided to split the collection in three parts, the other two being:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-3-of-3-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 3 of 3 – Zine Quest&lt;/a&gt;

First I’d like to point you to the cthulhuoid and mythos inspired game of &lt;b&gt;DARK VOID&lt;/b&gt;. The English game originates in Germany and offers a quite fascinating Science Fiction setting. Including galaxy spanning drama between various alien races and a dash of Lovecrafts Mythos. The d20 based system looks solid and can be seen at in the preview document. I gladly offer a recommendation of the project. Another interesting, and somewhat more traditional take on HPLs Mythus is presented in &lt;b&gt;Tiny Cthulhu&lt;/b&gt;. The well tested d6 system by Gallant Knight is applied to form a fun, little horror game well worth a look.
Speaking of the deep ones, games like &lt;b&gt;Descent into Midnight&lt;/b&gt; let you dive into an intruiging aquatic setting. You’ll be assuming the form of various creatures that are poised to defend their communities and families. The Powered by the Apocalypse system gets utilized to create engaging threats and form a fascinating world. You can talk a look at it as they provide a quickstarter and despite me not being a fan of aquatic games, I feel quite tempted. Give it a shot. Maybe you prefer to play transhumanist mermaids in a post-apocalyptic setting? In this case &lt;b&gt;Mermaids After the End&lt;/b&gt; has you covered. The game is based on a d12 setting and offers anime style illustrations.
Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Linen Tapestry&lt;/b&gt;, which kinda falls into the realms of Urban(?) Fantasy. The characters are heroes in a world which is influenced by a „great cycle“ that interacts with three intervowen dimensions of existence. The description on their page sounds interesting and the d10 based Open Hand system solid. Then there’s another go to fund &lt;b&gt;Soulbound&lt;/b&gt;. Which will provide your character with a randomly generated arcane weapon that’s bound to their soul – for better or worse. Embedded in a dark industrial fantasy worlds it doesn’t give of a lot of „edo vibes“ and the d6 system looks functional. I think it’s worth a look. Maybe you are more a fan of magical Ninjas – as portrayed in various anime – in which case &lt;b&gt;Kunai Academy&lt;/b&gt; might be right up your ally.
I personally got seduced by &lt;b&gt;Wampir: Maskarada gra fabularna&lt;/b&gt; – a project by Alis.Games to translate the 5th edition of Vampire: The Masquerade into Polish. Not that I speak Polish, though I did start to learn it, but the game offers a collection of 5 original V5 scenarios, an orginal V5 chronicle, original V5 music and more stuff. Plus, it’s done by the nice and competent people of the Vtes.Store. I love it, back it and recommend it – even more if you actually speak Polish.
There are more cool projects like the &lt;b&gt;Modern: Necromancy | The Book Of The Dead&lt;/b&gt;, which presents me with a strong temptation to back it. If you are a fan of D&amp;D 5E you’ll find many sourcebooks like &lt;b&gt;Dragon Stew&lt;/b&gt; and a setting in Monte Cooks Ptolus – which is as well ready to be played with the Cypher system. Maybe you’re interested in soundscape like the &lt;b&gt;Musicians of Ravensburg&lt;/b&gt; projects?
