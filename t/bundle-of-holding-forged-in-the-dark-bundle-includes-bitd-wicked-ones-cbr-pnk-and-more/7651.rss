For just  **US$9.95**  you get all  *five*  complete games and scenarios in our  **Starter Collection**  (retail value  **$54.50** ) as DRM-free ebooks, including the dungeon-delving adventure  *Into the Dark* ; the fairy-tale melodrama  *Errant Deeds: Tall Tales in the Blackwood* ; the minimalist (two-pamphlet!) cyberpunk adaptation  *CBR+PNK*  (and its ready-to-play scenario  *Mind the Gap* ) -- and yes, once again we include John Harper&#39;s  *Blades in the Dark*  core rulebook itself (previously in last December&#39;s  *Blades in the Dark*  Bundle), along with four unofficial  *Blades*  playbooks.

And if you pay more than the threshold price of $35.04, you&#39;ll  **level up**  and  *also*  get our entire  **Bonus Collection**  with  *six*  recent standalone games and supplements worth an additional  **$95,**  including Mythic Gazetteer&#39;s brand-new RPG of paranormal investigation and office politics,  *External Containment Bureau* ; Bandit Camp&#39;s  *Wicked Ones,*  a tabletop answer to the  *Dungeon Keeper*  and  *War for the Overworld*  computer games;  *Sig: City of Blades*  (Genesis of Legend Publishing), a standalone Forged recasting of the spiritual successor to  *Planescape, Sig: Manual of the Primes*  (2016);  *Copperhead County,*  about crime and corruption in Tennessee; and  *Disaster/PEACE - A Magical Girl RPG*  (A Couple of Drakes).

Ten percent of your payment (after gateway fees) goes to this Forged offer&#39;s pandemic-related charity, [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/coronavirus-outbreak/). Direct Relief sends protective gear and critical care medications to health workers, with emergency deliveries to medical facilities across the US and to regional response agencies across the world.
