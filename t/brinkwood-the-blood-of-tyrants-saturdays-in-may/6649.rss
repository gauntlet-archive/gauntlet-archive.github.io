The usual priority RSVP period has been waived.

*Mask up. Spill blood. Drink the Rich.*

![Brinkwood|252x500](upload://8SztVWcONEMTUCaWNEZLdB2o41x.jpeg) 

The world is not as it should be. The rich feed, literally, upon the poor, as blood-sucking vampires who barely bother to conceal their horrific, parasitic nature. The downtrodden peoples of the world struggle under the burdens of rent, payable through the sweat of their labor or the blood of their veins. Evil has triumphed. Many have given in to despair. But all is not lost.

In Brinkwood, you take on the role of renegades, thieves, and rebels struggling for freedom and liberation in a castylpunk world controlled by vampires. Radicalized by tragedy, you have taken up arms and fled into the forests, where you were taken in by unlikely allies - the fae, forgotten creatures of myth - who offered a different path and the means to fight back against your oppressors.

Masks, forged of old wood and older magic, are the final tool left to fight a war long ago lost. If you wear them, they will take their price, etching themselves upon your very soul. But they will also let you spill the blood of the rich and powerful vampires that now rule the land, and from that blood strengthen yourself and your movement.


**Content Warning**: horror, war, trauma, violence, radicalization, systemic oppression
**System**: Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants (Forged in the Dark)
**Duration**: Five 3 1/2-hour sessions
**Breaks**: 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins each) or as required
**Venue**: GM’s Zoom
**Recording**: Yes, but made public only with all players&#39; enthusiastic consent!
**Attendance**: Joining all sessions is ideal but not required
**Safety**: Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, and Open Door Policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.
