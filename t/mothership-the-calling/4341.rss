Comrades!
	On this first day of 2183, we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of our victory over The Corporation.  Today we give thanks to the many heroes that lost their lives in The Great War so that the Union of Progressive Peoples might be free of oppression.

Soldiers of the Space Operating Forces! 
	Whether you are stationed on a listening post on an airless moon, a garrison on an alien world, or onboard an interstellar cruiser, you are today’s front line heroes.  May you always stay vigilant and ready for the day when the industrialists try to bring us back under the lash.
	While our tables may sometimes be bare, our hearts are full of the songs of freedom.  As the sun sets on all the planets of the Home Systems, the people look to the skies, sing The Anthem, and raise a glass to you.

Love live The Revolution!
                                                                  -  The Glorious Leader


Here are four sessions of MOTHERSHIP scheduled for Tuesdays in February.  MOTHERSHIP is a sci-fi horror RPG and won the 2019 ENnie gold medal for best game.  It&#39;s an OSR adjacent system with surprising depth arising out of its easy to learn and relatively light set of mechanics.  

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. The Gauntlet inclusivity policy will be in effect and we will be using safety tools; the open door, X-card, and lines and veils.

We will use Streamyard and Roll20 to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.</description>
