*******PLEASE NOTE: an RSVP to this session constitutes an RSVP to the other three sessions running as part of Game Facilitator Camp: Ochre Jelly, on: Saturday 14 Nov; Saturday 21 Nov; and Saturday 28 Nov, all at the same 9:00PM Manila time.*******

**If you will not be able to attend all 4 sessions it would be best to wait and attend a Game Facilitator Camp (GFC) when your schedule is more open.**

We&#39;ve tried to make this year&#39;s GFCs as accessible as possible to timezones around the world while also fitting in with our own schedules. Hopefully, if this one doesn&#39;t work for you, one of the others might.

Hello there! I’m  **Jammi**  (they/them), and I facilitate games on the Gauntlet Events Calendar ...  ***and I want you to, too!***

On the dates above I will be coaching 4 sessions of Game Facilitator Camp: one part support group, one part crash course on facilitating TTRPGs online, and as part of GFC:Ochre Jelly I will be supporting campers to run a one-shot of a game of their choice online.

In this initial session I will walk you through the steps of creating events on the Calendar, choosing the meeting software to use, starting the video call, and sharing your events through the official channels. I will demonstrate how to use resources like [Roll For Your Party](https://rollforyour.party/) and the [Play Aids folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByS4_7KbXro_UjhDSEtNbm0zRUU). We will also go over the [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and safety tools which are the foundation of the play culture that makes The Gauntlet such a special place to play. Finally we&#39;ll share our views on what makes online play work best and learn from one another how to ensure everyone at our virtual tables has a good time.

After this initial session, you will each, in turn, facilitate a one-shot session at the same time and on the dates detailed above.

I will attend each of these sessions myself, along with your fellow Jellies.  **Each session will be 4 hours long** (aim for up to 3 to 3.5 hours of gameplay and 30 mins of debrief). 

Obviously, you&#39;ll need to attend your own game, but you owe it to the other Jellies to attend theirs, too. This promotes the teamwork and community that is so important to The Gauntlet.

***As it says above, if you will not be able to attend all the sessions running as part of GFC: Ochre Jelly, it may be best to wait and attend a GFC when your schedule is more open.***

When choosing what to run for your session, my advice will be to pick a game:

* that you know well enough to feel comfortable with,
* that you find personally exciting, and
* that can support 4 players. It can be a GM-less game ... but you&#39;ll be the person taking the lead and &#39;teaching&#39; the game.

I&#39;ll be there to work with you to make sure you have everything you need to facilitate the game online!

I&#39;m really looking forward to playing in a game facilitated by each of you!
