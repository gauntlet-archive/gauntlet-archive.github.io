    <description>Hey all, I just found out about about a recent Nonbinary Game Jam. It&#39;s about making &quot;a game with a nonbinary main character or discussing the nonbinary experience in some way&quot;. There was one TTRPG (as far as I can tell) that was submitted. But there were 15 total games, most of which were video games of some sort, with 8 playable in browser. Submission has closed and the the &quot;voting&quot; is happening now.

I am going to check some of these out, especially &quot;[enbuddies](https://itch.io/jam/nonbinary-game-jam/rate/410647)&quot;, the TTRPG entry.</description>
