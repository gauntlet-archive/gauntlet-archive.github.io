ZOMBIE WORLD

Here are four sessions of ZOMBIE WORLD by Magpie Games.

Zombie World is a card-based tabletop roleplaying game of survivors fighting against the living and the dead for their own place in the world. The game is designed for easy, quick, and intense play.

In Zombie World, you take on the roles of ordinary people caught up in a zombie apocalypse, struggling to survive day after day, month after month, year after year, in a world destroyed by the restless dead.

Zombie World has its roots in the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Masks: A New Generation, but it takes that system in new directions, using special cards to generate characters, create situations, and resolve conflicts.

CONTENT WARNING: This may not be the game for you if you are sensitive to themes of extreme violence, sudden character death, and PvP conflict. We&#39;ll use communication and consent tools including the X-Card, Lines/Veils, and the Open Door to help everyone have a scary fun time, but please keep the contents and premise in mind.

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. We will use Streamyard and Roll20 to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.
