    <description>*&quot;Have you heard about that new school that has popped up in Huntsville, Massachussetts? They say it&#39;s for young hunters, so they can learn from the best - I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t hold with that. I learned from my momma, and she from her pop, and so on, and that was good enough for us! - And you hear weird stories about that place; haunted, or something. Well, I&#39;m not gonna check it out, can&#39;t stand young people. But somebody should, don&#39;t you think?&quot;*

Hearts of the Road is a light hack of Hearts of Wulin, designed to play modern-day monster hunters. And while the hunt is important, family is even more important ...

These are three sessions where your characters go to investigate strange occurences, hunt gruesome monsters, and entangle each other in complicated relationships. You have to sign up for each session separately, and it is recommended that you sign up for all three of them.

One seat is reserved for Puckett.
