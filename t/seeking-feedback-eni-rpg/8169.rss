    <title>Seeking Feedback - ENI RPG</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/seeking-feedback-eni-rpg/8169</link>
    <description>Hi folks, I made a thing and I&#39;m struggling to get feedback. It might just be too simple, not worth your time, or plain boring. I&#39;m ok with hearing that but feel a bit lost not getting any feedback.

ENI is a rules-light, one-page, role-playing game system for new players who just want to jump into any setting. I use ENI with a group of six 8-10-year-olds  every week, as well as with my 8-year-old son on the drive to school. I tried to find the simplest and most meaningful set of rules that went just beyond roll a die and succeed on a 4 or higher.

In ENI, each player character starts with a name, an adjective, an item, and 6 dice that represent their stamina and health, and will get more dice within the first few sessions. Players choose which one of their ready dice to exert when faced with a challenge. Challenges succeed at 4 or higher, with varying degrees of success.

Players who get into the story get a one-time +1 that they can add to a die roll. There are loose rules for combat, turn order in combat, resting, and companions. There is also a table for great successes. The story, special abilities, upgrades, gear, loot, etc are left to the player&#39;s and game master&#39;s imagination.

That&#39;s mostly it! ENI is only a system, it does not have any content written for it yet. Please check it out here: https://ex1st.itch.io/eni I will thank you for your time and effort.

Note: I already submitted ENI to a previous One-Page RPG Game Jam, but I have improved it a bit since.</description>

</aside>
<p>Yes, thank you! Right for the start, combat was no different from any other roll. I added combat stuff to explain and structure turn order. It used to be everyone takes a turn, then we do it all again. Now, I’ve removed turn order structure, I don’t need Combat or Danger. Win Win.</p>

<p>Let some challenges be extra dangerous, which will cause conditions, like “cursed”, “sick”, “exhausted” or “hurt” on a failed roll. The same condition can be applied multiple times.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is like giving players an extra life, I like it. I wonder how 5 conditions would affect a character’s performance during any kind of challenge. It might be a downward spiral. So I think I will simplify the rules here and soften the recovery to just 1 die (highest).</p>
<p>By the way, my players have 12 dice each now. I think they leveled up from “novice” to “pro” a bit too quick, but let’s see how it plays out.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Dice getting used up too quickly has been a concern, but so far players have been cautious about it, knowing when to run away. Which I think is also a good thing to learn. But having 1 die resolve a scene as the norm would abstract the sense of being there and interacting with the world in detail. That said…</p>
<p>Having one die roll resolve the challenge is possible… like the first blow (from an intimidating PC) shakes down the thug and turns him into a coward. This is down to the game master and how the players weave the story. The threat level can always be raised if the players are rolling high, but it’s hard to turn it down once the bad guys have spawned in.</p>

              <p>I think the resolution system would gain a lot if you didn’t think of “combat” as a separate thing in comparison to other rolls. Some suggestions to slim the system down:</p>
<p><strong>Always roll a d4</strong><br>
Let it stand for “the character’s name” or something. Then the player may add any one of the readied dice (d6-d20) to that roll, taking the highest result of those two.</p>
<p>You don’t need to spend text to explain special rules.</p>
<p>This will skew the probabilities a bit, raising the success rate by 25% while also generate more great successes.</p>
<p><strong>Change “Combat” to “Dangers” that create conditions</strong><br>
Let some challenges be extra dangerous, which will cause conditions, like “cursed”, “sick”, “exhausted” or “hurt” on a failed roll. The same condition can be applied multiple times. A player may remove a condition during recovery by choosing not to recover the highest die. If the number of conditions exceeds the number of readied dice the character dies.</p>

<p>A possible idea would be that a 1 on a die creates a condition, so that the player <em>wants</em> to roll two dice.</p>
<p><strong>Group challenges should be the standard</strong><br>
Let all players, that have characters present, roll for a challenge if they want to, suggesting they are helping each other to succeed (seems nice to teach kids to cooperate). Sometimes, a challenge will create a condition unless a successful roll is made, so everyone wants to roll anyways.</p>
<p>Again this will skew the probability. Four players rolling d4s will have a 70% success rate.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages gives an extra d4</strong><br>
A player can spend an advantage to get to roll an extra d4, when advantage is applicable.</p>
<p>You then don’t need to explain that result 1-6 on the reward table will end until the next rest.</p>
<p>I would make result 1-8 to advantages, describing each result as “Advantage: become charming” and “Advantage: learn a secret”.</p>
<p>You don’t really explain what “becoming fast” actually does for the game, but with advantages, you will.</p>

<p>As an analogy, if this game was “a car”, it shows you how to drive but does not tell you where to go. And yes, some points of interest, purpose, and a few plot points would be nice. I know it sounds a bit lame, but the players decide who they are, what they are, and why they are. Also, I would say that not dying is one of the motivations.</p>

              <p>I think the system suffers somewhat from having no clear focus (this is a common issue in “generic” or “universal” rpgs, which are never really universal). Just going from what is on the page, the rules are almost all about fighting or dying, with no sense that anyone has any motivations or reasons for acting. So is that all the game is about, just fighting without any coherent story or motivation?</p>

<p>The Great Success rewards are a weak part of the rules. Here is what I have in mind for now.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="10">
<li>GREAT SUCCESS<br>
When you roll the die’s highest value during a challenge, you succeed and may re-roll that die and consult the following table:</li>
</ol>
<p>1 Become charming	<br>
2 Become wise	<br>
3 Become fast	<br>
4 Become strong	<br>
5 Enemies fear you	<br>
6 Deal double damage	<br>
7 See the future<br>
8 Learn a secret	<br>
9 Gain a silver coin*	<br>
10 Gain a gold coin**	<br>
11 Recover 1 dice<br>
12 Recover 2 dice<br>
13 Recover 3 dice<br>
14 Gain a D4, spent<br>
15 Gain a D6, spent<br>
16 Gain a D8, spent<br>
17 Gain a D10, spent<br>
18 Gain a D12, spent<br>
19 Gain a D20, spent<br>
20 Choose any reward</p>
<p>1-6 last until rest. 1-4 adds a maximum of +1 to an appropriate challenge.* Tossing a silver coin lets you add +1 to any die.<br>
** Tossing a gold coin lets you re-roll any die.<br>
result after it is rolled, even to your friend’s die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since you never totally exhaust your D4, so you could go on rolling it for everything and get a bunch of buffs, so I capped it a bit.</p>
<p>I like this a bit more.</p>
<p>Is it better for you?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

</aside>
<p>It depends on the item. The items are either chosen by the game master, or players.</p>
<p>I updated the REWARDS text in the 2022.06.26 version of the rules (now online) as follows:</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>REWARDS<br>
At an appropriate time during the adventure (See 2), a character may gain an item, ability, or companion. Items may be common, functional, special, clues, important parts of the story, etc. Abilities allow the PC to do cool stuff once between every good rest. Companions are OCs (See 6) that are assigned to a PC.</li>
</ol>
<p>*OCs meaning “other characters” (aka NPC).</p>

<p>Great Success:</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thank you. Good point. I wanted fuzzy rules here. It’s mainly thematic, a way to give the players permission to try something, and lean into if they fail a roll.</p>
<p>This section has also been updated. I see what you mean. “Become Fast” is just a way to say that if a situation called for speed you either automatically succeed or get a +1 or whatever the game master/players deem appropriate.</p>
<p>“See the future” would be… a made-up scenario, like everyone succeeding, or a bridge being crossed, or someone betraying someone… then it becomes part of the story and may become true, may be avoided, may be forgotten.</p>
<p>“Learn a secret” same as above.</p>
<p>Both would be only known/communicated to that player or shared openly, and mad eup on the spot, propelling the story one way or another, foreshadowing stuff to come.</p>
<p>“Deal double damage” One successful hit would take a OC down twice or outright defeating a D6.</p>
<p>“Improve a skill” if you use a skill/ability you would get a +1 on the die result. So a +1 but for a specific action. <strong>Note:</strong> Skill are just abilites, no diference. I will phase out skills.</p>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, I’ve fixed a few things already.</p>
<p>Do I need to spell out the mechanical effect of the buff, or can I leave it up to the <strong>players</strong> to decide?</p>
<p>I trust them.</p>

<p>Oh… I had not noticed. I think death is important, but I would say 25%. Let me check and see if I improve something in this regard. Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you. The main benefit is that they don’t spend their die. But since that is what NPCs do, I should just explain it that way. Thanks again.</p>

<p>This part seems broken. Or rather, you might as well roll that D4 to see if you avoid it.</p>
