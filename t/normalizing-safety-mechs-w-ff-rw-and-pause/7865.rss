    <description>It’s probably not unique to this game, but I like how “stealing the throne” by Nick Bate solves the problem of normalizing safety mechanics by making them something players use in-game for many other situations besides x-carding things….  If people get used to rewinding, pausing, and fast forwarding as normal narrative devices, it is less threatening or awkward to pull these levers when we need to make the game “table”  a safe and positive space for all.  
Just commenting.  But im interested in anyone else’s take.  

I used to talk game stuff over at storygames.com back when that existed.  Pretty nice to have this space to discuss.  But I’m not sure if I’m using the forum as intended, so please advise me if im posting in wrong place or am not hip to any other ways to be nice and cool here.

              <p>Really great point <a class="mention" href="/u/curiouscat">@CuriousCat</a>.<br>
I also enjoy when games style safety tools into the themes of a game. For example in Wanderhome, the “journey tools” evoke this and in Gabrielle and my Ma Nishtana, the “Wait Wait Wait!” move allows anyone to ask questions or change the narrative while reflecting how our families actually talk at the table, evoking the theme of family in play.</p>

              <p>Thirsty Sword Lesbians gives all characters an XP, when a player used a safety tool at the table (including brief check-ins).</p>
<p>Firebrands games all have consent mechanics worked into their mini games. It’s most obvious in the “An Intimate Moment” one where characters negotiate physical touch and literally ask each other for permission. But similar exchanges of question/response that imply consent can also be found in the minigames that are about fighting one-on-one, having conversations, and other encounters.</p>
<p>I also want to mention my game <a href="https://catcurious.itch.io/improveto" rel="nofollow noopener">ImproVeto</a> that is both a casual, fun storygame and a way to practice both improvisation and X-card use. It works both as a short standalone game and as a warm-up before a regular session or during a session zero.</p>

<p>Yeah, I never liked the safety tools when they are a “layer” on top of other mechanics. I think <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Archipelago</a> solved it in such a nice way with “Try another way” - a ritual phrase that you can use while playing, among with “Describe in more details” and similar phrases.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://blackfiskforlag.com/product/in-orbit-pdf/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">In Orbit</a> (In English, but on a Swedish pay-what-you-want site) does a really good job implementing safety tools as part of the setup. It’s only two pages long, and still manages to squeeze in safety tools—as part of the setup—while being a really good game.</p>
