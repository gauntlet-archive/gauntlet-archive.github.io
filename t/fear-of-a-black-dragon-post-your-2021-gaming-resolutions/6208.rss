    <description>@Coalhada and I are doing a special holiday episode of Fear of a Black Dragon, and as part of that, we want to hear your 2021 gaming resolutions. Are there any particular games or modules you want to try? Are you going to try to game more often? Really, any New Years resolution related to tabletop gaming is fair game. Post them in the replies here; we’ll select a few to read on air. 

Thanks!

              <p>Because I have sold games for many years, I have long ‘justified’ my gaming as an extension of my career and professional life. The pandemic pushed the decision to end that career on to me, and I find myself struggling with figuring out how to ‘justify’ all this gaming when it’s not directly tied to work.</p>
<p>So my main resolution for 2021 is to spend as much time playing and facilitating and creating as I can reasonably manage, but be OK with playing solely because it brings me joy and it’s how I make friends and feel creative. Basically, to work on the need to justify it to myself and others as being part of a <em>hustle</em> of some kind. To finally make peace with being ‘a gamer’ because that what I want out of life.</p>
<p>Also to learn Affinity publisher do when I do make things they are pretty.</p>

              <p>My 2021 plans are to run more games - I’ve got my home group of 3 - 5 and just added three more 5E fans so I think I can get a home (well Zoom) game going with up to 8 now (more likely the usual number will be 4-5 - but that’s the joy of open tables).</p>
<p>More interestingly I intend to get a few things published. A) ruleset aimed at exploration and dungeon crawl play based on OD&amp;D and what I think of as the “2012 Toronto Old School” scene rules, that I’m calling CRAWL (1/2 Done - Quickstart almost done). B) An introductory adventure called “Tomb Robbers of the Crystal Frontier”. Low Western influenced opium fantasy about looting the crashed crystal fortresses/tombs of space elves … err … Empyreans. (written, 1/2 illustrated, 1/2 laid out) C) A companion zine/adventure to Ultan’s Door No. 3 (currently at publisher).  So 3 works out in the first 1/2 of the year.</p>
<p>Finally, I need to do a good, complete read of Apocalypse World and Night Witches to get a better understanding of the play style.</p>

              <p>I’m enjoying the FKR trend and hope to run more games in that style — especially within the Alan Garner canon.</p>
<p>I’m also planning on getting my OSR titles <strong>Gully-Toads</strong> and <strong>Ouroboros</strong> polished up and released as premium zines: we need more no class gaming out there.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/coalhada">@Coalhada</a> and I are doing a special holiday episode of Fear of a Black Dragon, and as part of that, we want to hear your 2021 gaming resolutions. Are there any particular games or modules you want to try? Are you going to try to game more often? Really, any New Years resolution related to tabletop gaming is fair game. Post them in the replies here; we’ll select a few to read on air.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
