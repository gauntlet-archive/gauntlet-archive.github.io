    <title>The Curse of the House of Rookwood (Sundays in July)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-curse-of-the-house-of-rookwood-sundays-in-july/8066</link>
    <description>This is a role-playing game of decaying nobility, Gothic horror, urban fantasy, and supernatural conspiracy--but above all else, it is about the fraying bonds of a dysfunctional family and their efforts to save themselves from their own darker natures. One player will take on the role of the Chronicler of the history of the Rookwood family and the other players will take on the roles of family members across several generations. 

At the start of the family’s story, we will discuss the details of the setting. While the default examples assume a Victorian British family, this is the time to talk about it and get everyone on the same page before determining the details of the family members and their resources.

We will as a group decide on questions of place, era, themes and tone. In play we will check in as to how many generations we&#39;ll get to include in our five sessions - assume one or two, based on how much drama we can fit in!
