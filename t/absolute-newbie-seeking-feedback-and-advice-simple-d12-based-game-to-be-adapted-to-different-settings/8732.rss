    <description>Hi all! I have written a playable prototype for a TTRPG but I&#39;m struggling with having anyone take a look at it. My friends and family aren&#39;t into TTRPGs and any acquaintances who happen to be just don&#39;t have time for an unfinished game.

The prototype is available to download free on Itch but I&#39;ve made several changes to the text in the last few weeks.

https://teh-201d.itch.io/blaze-of-glory

The live manuscript can be seen on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MWuKeiL3bs2BgIZ-_rNhhZFRaexBV0DmMEMokNezXhQ/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to see the latest version. 14,441 words last time I checked.

Some more about me and my game.
* I&#39;m a dude (he/him) in my 40s who started playing TTRPGs in my 30s.
* I started working on the game out of my frustrations with other game systems.
* It started as a mod for a popular game (bonus points if you can guess which), but I eventually swapped out everything with custom mechanics.
* I&#39;m extremely shy.
* I&#39;m just trying to do what I see in other books, but I don&#39;t know anything about layouts or anything. Seriously, any advice or feedback is welcome!
* The game started out as generic setting-less, then I decided to make it fantasy but hit a creativity wall, then decided to make it Cyberpunk and work on the fantasy version once the mechanics were tested.
* I Still don&#39;t know how much of a setting I want the game to have baked in, and how much should be up to the player. I&#39;ve heard this referred to as the goldilocks zone.
* I feel if my game were more polished and presentable, I could easily find playtesters and collaborators in local communities, in the meantime I&#39;m reaching out to game design enthusiasts on the interwebs.
* The typical response I get when I ask anyone for help is &quot;I&#39;d be glad to, just don&#39;t expect me to read anything.&quot;
*  One of the core design philosophies is to have dice mechanics that are easy to read, with math that can be done by counting fingers, and odds that are somewhat reliable.
* I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;m doing this right. Please let me know if I should edit or delete the post.
* I know the forums are going away in a couple days but Discord really stresses me out.

Just by reading this post you have done more for my game than any of my friends, and I appreciate it.</description>

<p>I also read Lancer does asl similar thing, also under a structure of play section. I already had a loadout scene written, so now all I have to do is add what happens before and after. I’m pretty excited.</p>

<p>Sounds neat! I’ll try to find a copy today. I really don’t want my combat to end up being Blades in the Dark but with d12s.</p>
<p>When I switch to fantasy it’s going to be a lot more combat focused as JRPGs have always been one of my greatest inspirations.</p>

<p>Ah, well, back when I started I didn’t have much TTRPG experience. I had only played D&amp;D 3.5, Pathfinder and Savage Worlds.

So, I set out to make a game without resource management (because no one cares about how many arrows anyone has, and no one is subtracting the cost of their meals from their sheet) and that defaults to theater of the mind (becase everyone kept guesstimating the range of attacks, and also because tables were never large enough to lay down a battlefield where ranged combat mattered, anyway).</p>

<p>Yeah, I trudged the same path. I learned a lot from the first game I published. I think it’s good to release a game as soon as possible, just to get it out of the way, and learn from that experience. So switching setting could be a good thing, if it’s a fantasy game that you really want to make.</p>

<p>More specifically, I think I need to figure out layout, and get lots of flashy art. No one (it feels like) wants to look at a block of text (even potental playtesters). But I think I need to make sure the game text is solid before I invest in such things.</p>

<p>You need clearer goals - when is it more polished and presentable? I’ve read the first two pages, and they are well written, from what I can tell. When it comes to graphic design, I’ve written a <a href="https://www.erebaltor.se/rickard/typography/" rel="nofollow noopener">short manual</a>. You basically only need the first page, but the GDoc looks already better than most other amateur works (and some “professional” American games).</p>

<p>Ah yes, thanks for the heads up. Most of the information I have from this community is outdated, I guess because a lot has changed and continued to change.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are communities out there that are more about design collaboration.</p>

              <p>You can join the Open Hearth Patreon, get an invite to their Slack community, participate in a game facilitator camp, and start running games. Lots folks there are game designers, and they can give you valuable feedback. At least, that’s what I did, and I’ve found it very rewarding.</p>

              <p>Hi all! I have written a playable prototype for a TTRPG but I’m struggling with having anyone take a look at it. My friends and family aren’t into TTRPGs and any acquaintances who happen to be just don’t have time for an unfinished game.</p>
<p>The prototype is available to download free on Itch but I’ve made several changes to the text in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Some more about me and my game.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a dude (he/him) in my 40s who started playing TTRPGs in my 30s.</li>
<li>I started working on the game out of my frustrations with other game systems.</li>
<li>It started as a mod for a popular game (bonus points if you can guess which), but I eventually swapped out everything with custom mechanics.</li>
<li>I’m extremely shy.</li>
<li>I’m just trying to do what I see in other books, but I don’t know anything about layouts or anything. Seriously, any advice or feedback is welcome!</li>
<li>The game started out as generic setting-less, then I decided to make it fantasy but hit a creativity wall, then decided to make it Cyberpunk and work on the fantasy version once the mechanics were tested.</li>
<li>I Still don’t know how much of a setting I want the game to have baked in, and how much should be up to the player. I’ve heard this referred to as the goldilocks zone.</li>
<li>I feel if my game were more polished and presentable, I could easily find playtesters and collaborators in local communities, in the meantime I’m reaching out to game design enthusiasts on the interwebs.</li>
<li>The typical response I get when I ask anyone for help is “I’d be glad to, just don’t expect me to read anything.”</li>
<li>One of the core design philosophies is to have dice mechanics that are easy to read, with math that can be done by counting fingers, and odds that are somewhat reliable.</li>
<li>I’m not even sure I’m doing this right. Please let me know if I should edit or delete the post.</li>
<li>I know the forums are going away in a couple days but Discord really stresses me out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just by reading this post you have done more for my game than any of my friends, and I appreciate it.</p>
