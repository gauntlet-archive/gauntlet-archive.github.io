    <description>Because of scheduling conflicts among players, a run of Thirsty Sword Lesbians I have previously posted has been moved 2 hours later to 11 AM PST (GMT-7). As a reminder for anyone who is interested, Volume 1 of Cosmoknights is available both in print and is available to be read online for free [here](https://www.cosmoknights.space/). While being able to read the entire book in time for our first session is ideal, it&#39;s not required. Even if you&#39;ve only managed to get through some of it in time for the reading club, feel free to join us for our discussion and TSL run.

              <p>Sure if you follow the link above to the original posting, you can find the links for the gauntlet calendar. We actually have openings for all of October, as we have a player who’s dropped the game without removing themselves from the calendar.</p>
<p>I’ll also drop the link here, in case that makes it easier to find: <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-reading-club-cosmoknights-thirsty-sword-lesbians/7143" class="inline-onebox">Gauntlet Reading Club: CosmoKnights/Thirsty Sword Lesbians</a></p>
<p>If you are new to the gauntlet community, you’ll need to set up a free account over on the calendar app to register.</p>
<p>Feel free to drop me a direct message with any questions you have about the event.or how to sign up for games with the app.</p>

    This event is based off an experiment run by David Morrison earlier this year, and I am cribbing a lot of his explanation here. Sundays in September and October, I’ll be running a combined book club and series of game sessions based on the book we have read. The first session is to discuss the book we have read together, our thoughts on it, and what we can draw from it to bring into a roleplaying game. For this run, I have chosen the first volume of <a href="https://www.cosmoknights.space/book-one" rel="nofollow noopener">CosmoKnights by Hannah Templer</a> as the book, an…
