    <title>Visigoths vs Mall Goths: Sextet Playtest #1 and #2</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/visigoths-vs-mall-goths-sextet-playtest-1-and-2/2682</link>
    <description>Visigoths vs. Mall Goths is a tabletop roleplaying game and dating sim about the conflicts and romances among the warriors who sacked ancient Rome and 20th century spooky teens, set in a shopping mall in a Los Angeles suburb in 1996. There are a lot of bisexuals.

The game is currently in development, so we&#39;ll be recording this session, and will invite designer @oh_theogony to watch and take notes.

Because this is a game driven by the adventures of hormonal teens, we&#39;ll have a thorough consent and cooperation discussion beforehand, and X-Card/Script Change, Lines &amp; Veils, and Open Door will all be in use during play.

This will be the first time I&#39;m running the game with 6 players, so please understand there may be a few hiccups, but I&#39;ll do my level best to make sure we have a Rome-sacking, mascara-applying, hilarious good time. 

THESE ARE ONE-SHOT GAMES, but feel free to sign up for both sessions, we&#39;d love if you tried both sides of the Mall Goth/Visigoth divide!

Session #1: [date=2019-09-18 time=20:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LkMs0KZiAuJ_Y7vX1a2
