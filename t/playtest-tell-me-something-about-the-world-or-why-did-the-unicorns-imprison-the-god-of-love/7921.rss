*Who created the Crown of Tears? And why?*

*Where did the dragons go?*

*What decided the outcome of the war between the Troll Pirate Republic and the Merchant Kings?*

*Who stole Death&#39;s scythe?*

*Was the Citadel of Cruelty ever rebuilt?*

*How did the Underland Goblins and the River Angels seal their alliance?*

*Did the God of Love escape his imprisonment? Who helped him?*

Tell Me Something About the World is a card driven storytelling game about creating a fantasy world by telling its story through questions and answers, from its creation until its inevitable end.

On your turn you can ask up to two questions. Then all the players, including you, draw cards and combine them into a suggested answers. Finally, everyone votes on which answer they want to become true in the story.

That&#39;s it! Now you know how to play.

(Okay, there are a few more rules than that, but that&#39;s the core.)

Note that this is a playtest. The game is very close to being finished when it comes to the rules, but the implementation on playingcards.io is new and there may be technical glitches.

Also note that the game may not last the full three hours.

This game is scheduled for a single session. If there is sufficient interest I will add more to the calendar.

Safety tools that will be used include Lines &amp; Veils, the X Card, and the open door policy. [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in effect.
