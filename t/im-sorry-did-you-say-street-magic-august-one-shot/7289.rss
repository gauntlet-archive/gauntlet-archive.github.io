    <description>*i&#39;m sorry did you say street magic*  is a GMless city-building story game for two to six players by Caro Asercion. Discover and imagine a city filled with life and vivid detail, packed with a myriad of neighborhoods, landmarks, and residents. Discover their true names, and the ways that they intersect—then set events in motion that will change or alter their relationships.

We’ll be using Lines and Veils, the X Card, and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html. 

We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. The sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players. I’ll send a group email a few days before the game to confirm interest, share play materials, etc. 

Open access time for sign-ups is 10am 18/8 AEST.
