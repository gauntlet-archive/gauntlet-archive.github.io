          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/07/05/crowdfunding-collection-145/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #145, including every tabletop rpg project started between 06/14 and 07/05</b></a>.</p>
<p>The collection has no fewer than 70 projects, which makes it massive. Thanks to reason of time, the sheer amount and my health, I didn’t took a deep dive into every project, but hope to offer an interesting overview…</p>
<p>You will find that the <b>Slayers</b> roleplaying game present you the opportunity to hunt monsters in a city that will be formed by your players. Next to 4 different classes the game sports an asynchron combat system, which I find very, very fascinating. There is a magazine based series of rpg games that will have have its first issue called <b>Adventure Presents: Tartarus Gate</b>. Within just 54 pages you’ll find a complete SciFi horror game that has everything included required to play, but the 3 six-sided dice. If you like to design your own setting, the <b>BYTE</b> RPG offers a d8 based system to facilitate it. Along with 7 ready made settings for those who aren’t that much into world building. If you are more a world building purist, and you are looking for „realistic“ rules, checkout the <b>5A System</b>. It might got you covered.<br>
If you are an anime fan and love the works of Studio Ghibli check out <b>Monster Care Squad</b>. In this game you’ll play as elite veterinarian who have to care about mythical creatures. Then there’s <b>My Anime Story</b>, if you like to implement your favorite anime setting yourself. Though the description is a bit bare bones.<br>
Fully fleshed and aimed at kids it the rpg <b>Fairies of the Mistglade</b>. Which has separate tiers for the age groups of 3 to 5, 5 to 8 and 8+ years old. With varying approaches to arithmetics to support the development of the children playing. The second edition of <b>SLICE</b> on the other hand is designed by kids for kids. Which occurs to me is a sure way to make sure that kids are actually interested in it.<br>
Straying away from children ~ maybe onto more people in puberty ~ who want to play a big, evil badguy, the <b>Dark Lord</b> has that covered. You assume the role of overlords who want to plunder, burn stuff down and kill the heroes. Thus you got a villain meetings and fitting campaign. If I were 20 years younger, I’d think that’s cool. Though the system does actually sound interesting. If you are interested in classic fantasy, maybe check out <b>Alpha Duo</b>. You can download the base version of the rules system for free. Then there’s the old school fantasy game <b>Chronicles of the Secret Time</b> from Italy. Which looks very cool and is worth having a look.<br>
Fans of rule-lite game should check out <b>Vizor</b> with it’s dynamic character creation and utilization of cards, and/or <b>Runt</b> which focuses on a narrative approach and is genre agnostic.<br>
If you open up the <b>Storybox!</b> project, you’ll get 8 narrative games in one kickstarter, and with Our Innermost Thoughts you’ll have 5 experience to explore yourself.<br>
Maybe you are looking for a gamebook? Then check out the classical game book Myrrk Book One. It sounds legit. <b>The Dark Village</b> isn’t classic at all, but I think it is a good fit for the category and worth checking out.<br>
Next to all those games, I think you should give the <b>Campo de Mitos</b> setting by Paco Jaen a chance. It takes the mythos to a place in Gibralta and looks very cool. The <b>Sinful RPG</b> sourcebook will enable to add sinful sprincles into your scenario. Where I am just in love with the design of the <b>Elixier Dice</b>. They got swirly, glittery stuff in them… beautiful! Though the dice from <b>Dice Macabre</b> and <b>Dawn and Dusk</b> got nice designs as well. Well, and if you are prone to say <b>No More Dice</b>,… that project offers an abacus like alternative to roling. It might be among the <b>Things Heroes Say</b>? Which is a collection of RPG phrases.<br>
