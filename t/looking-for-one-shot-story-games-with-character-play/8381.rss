    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/looking-for-one-shot-story-games-with-character-play/8381</link>
    <description>Hello! I&#39;m looking for games to have in my one shot kit that can help introduce new players to the feeling of portraying a character. Mostly looking for self-contained story games designed to be played in one or two sessions, with or without a GM/facilitator. 

Here&#39;s a few that I know:

For the Queen
Fall of Magic
Companion&#39;s Tale
Ghost Lines
Psi-Run

What are your favourites?</description>

Games where you discover your character.<br>

Amnesia games, like Psi-Run and Penny for my thoughts, too.<br>
I’ve got games where everybody is under a disguise. You play to find out your character under the disguise.<br>
