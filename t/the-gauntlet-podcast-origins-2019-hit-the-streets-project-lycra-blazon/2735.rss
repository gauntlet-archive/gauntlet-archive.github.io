              <p>A great episode this week!</p>
<p>I wanted to chime in and confirm that GAMA is going through a  leadership shakeup right now, with a <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/42143/gama-appoints-new-executive-director" rel="nofollow noopener">new Executive Director</a> recently coming on board. I suspect that had a lot to do with any difficulty Games on Demand may have encountered this year. GoD puts butts in seats, and we collect quite a bit of generic ticket revenue every year, so we’re definitely a valued participant, despite this year’s hiccups.</p>
<p>That said, the very best thing everyone can do is <a href="https://www.originsgamefair.com/contact-us" rel="nofollow noopener">LET GAMA KNOW</a> that Games on Demand is a draw for you, and that you consider their attention to it important. In your tweets and Facebook posts, go ahead and tag Origins (<span class="mention">@originsgames</span>) and the official Games on Demand account (<span class="mention">@Games_On_Demand</span>) in your reviews and requests.</p>
<p>For my part, my best moment of Origins was when someone told me I was “the nicest high-strung person” they had ever met. That’s my brand, right there. For anyone else, it’s very possible to come to Origins and settle into Games on Demand and never leave! Do it!</p>
