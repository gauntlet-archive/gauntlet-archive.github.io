You are star-crossed warrior-lovers in a mountain monastery ruled by dragons. As your home is rocked by the accusation that human heretics are plotting against the wise and regal dragons, can you uphold your faction&#39;s honor, win your heart&#39;s desire, and impress Dragonliege Ozukai?

We will be playing a two-shot of [Hearts of Wulin](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/hearts-of-wulin.html), a game of wuxia melodrama, Powered by the Apocalypse. We’ll be testing out a starter and setting I have created called  **In The Shadow of Dragons.**  The setting is inspired by media where dragons reign over human martial artists, such as  *Avatar: The Last Airbender*  and Tarkir from the lore of  *Magic: The Gathering* .

**NB: This is two-shot over two consecutive nights. We are playing September 2nd and September 3rd.**

NUMBER OF SESSIONS: There will be 2 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

DURATION: 3 hours

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 4 players total. One slot is reserved for someone who has yet to play Hearts of Wulin. Message me if that is you!

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: We will use CATS, the X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and the Open Door Policy. This event abides by the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

SET UP INFO: We will play over Streamyard. Expect a set-up email from me about a week before the first session, with a link to a Google sheet character keeper.

BREAKS: two ten-minute breaks (and more as requested)

RECORDED: Provided all players give permission, sessions will be recorded and posted to the Cloven Pine Games Youtube channel.

PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: No, rules will be taught in play.
