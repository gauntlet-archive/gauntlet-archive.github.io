    <title>Absurdia: The Longest Friday</title>

    <description>***For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you haven&#39;t played in a game I&#39;ve run this year.***

For residents of Absurdia, life can be tough: arcane bureaucracy, sentient machines, maniacal PTAs, and the occasional cosmic horror as they attempt to survive, overcome, and perhaps even escape the darkly idyllic community. That’s why you were so excited about your big plans for Friday night: a chance to blow off steam, relax and just really enjoy yourself for once. Unfortunately, it’s now been Friday afternoon for three weeks and there’s still no sign of evening. It looks like you’re going to have to call your friends, roll up your sleeves, and figure out what is going on now.

**Absurdia**  is an absurdist modern pbta game about the inane hilarity and understated horror of everyday life by Quinn Majeski. It&#39;s inspired by works of absurd humor, surreal horror, and literary nonsense like Welcome to Night Vale, Alice in Wonderland, Gravity Falls, and the Twilight Zone. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter in this game could include the dark/seedy underbellies of suburbia and the collapse of identity and reality. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

Sessions will run over Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. I like to record sessions for note-taking purposes, but will only post them if all players are into that. 

Attendance at all sessions is not required, but please sign up for all sessions you want to attend.

I’ll email players a week before the game to confirm attendance and share play materials.

Open access time for sign ups is 7.30pm 12 September 2022 AEST.

Session two: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-NBahhl63TdcP6F34lMV
