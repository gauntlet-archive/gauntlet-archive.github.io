    <title>Through Ultan&#39;s Door Issue 2 Available now</title>

    <description>Hi, I&#39;m Ben L, the creator of Through Ultan&#39;s Door zine. Issue 2 of Through Ultan&#39;s Door is out now. It takes you down the sewer river into the Catacombs of the Fleischguild, replete with fiendish traps of the butcher priests, a blood demon lusting after a gem called the Heart of Haldicar, flayed heretics, and much more! It also has articles on house rules for playing in the dreamlands, and on the undead of Wishery--the shades of Zyan. It&#39;s brought to life with gorgeous cartography by Gus L and art by Russ Nicholson, Huargo, Jeremy Duncan, Orphicss, and Matt Hildebrand. It is edited by the peerless Fiona Geist, who is a true wordsmith. 

The zine is obviously written for OSR style games, but it would, I think, be quite hackable as a Dungeon World game. Anyway, you can check it out here: https://throughultansdoor.bigcartel.com/, or over on my blog https://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/. Right now it&#39;s only available in print + PDF, but as soon as the PDF is approved, it should be available at DriveThruRPG. You can ask me anything about it here. EDIT: The PDF has been approved!

              <p>I think you posted the wrong Big Cartel link – when I followed it I got a login page for Big Cartel. The link from your blog post (<a href="https://throughultansdoor.bigcartel.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://throughultansdoor.bigcartel.com/</a>) did work however.</p>
