    <description>***For first 24 hours, please only sign up if you haven&#39;t played in one of my games this year. One place in this game is saved for Puckett.***

It’s 1848 and the wave of political upheaval sweeping Europe has come to Wallachia. A provisional government is battling the  *Regulamentul Organic*  regime, promising land reform, civil rights, and the end of boyar privilege, but the balance of power remains precarious and there is no guarantee the revolution will succeed. Now you, a strange band of spies and criminals united by your support for the revolution, must travel to a small, isolated village deep into the Transylvanian wilderness to free an important radical leader.

Night’s Black Agents is a Gumshoe game about spies fighting a vampire conspiracy. This two-shot resets the action to the 1840s rather than the present, but I expect to run the game largely as written apart (in the interest of testing the rules ahead of a planned Dracula Dossier campaign next year). No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play.

Subject matter in this game includes vampire lore stuff: violence and gore, loss of agency, religious imagery. There’ll be references to political violence but largely off-screen and as background. 

Sessions will run over Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. I’d like to record sessions for my own use (figuring out how well the system works for me) but won’t post them unless all the players are keen on that. 

Attendance at both sessions is encouraged but not required. Please sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend. 

I’ll email players a week before the game to confirm attendance and share play materials.

Open access time for sign ups is 5pm 10/2/22 AEDT.
