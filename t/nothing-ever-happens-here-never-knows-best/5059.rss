    <description>Nothing Ever Happens Here: Never Knows Best

You&#39;re a pre-teen in a small town. Everybody expects things of you, you&#39;re stuck between being a kid and adult expectations, you&#39;re changing and so are all your friends in ways you don&#39;t quite understand. Oh, and also sometimes you turn into a giant robot and smash things.

This will be four sessions of Fraser Simon&#39;s RPG Never Knows Best on Thursday evenings in June 8 PM EDT (GMT -4).  Attendance at every session is ideal, but not required. The first session will consist largely of town and character creation, though we will also begin our story. Never Knows Best (NKB) is a PbtA game about middle school kids facing impending adulthood, growing up, and society’s—sometimes nonsensical—expectations and obligations inspired primarily by the anime FLCL. This game uses absurdism, metaphors, motifs, and literalization to represent the struggles and growth these kids go through. Society’s obligations and expectations manifest as outrageous forms—creatures and monsters not of this world. The kids combat these creatures by transforming into robots. Whenever a kid transforms, their robot takes on their unique strengths and traits representing how they reject society’s attempts to make kids conform and obey.In this way, the internal conflict kids face when growing up becomes something real and seen. Battles are metaphors for their inner turmoil about who they are, where they fit in, and who they want to be.

All Access sign up time is 4/24/2020 at 9:20 PM EDT (GMT-4)

We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Rules will be taught. Sessions will run up to three and a half hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.
If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
