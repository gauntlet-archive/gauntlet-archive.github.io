*Adventure Presents: Tartarus Gate* is a science-fiction, horror roleplaying game about unpaid interns on the ship Charon (pronounced *Kha-ron*).

It&#39;s the year 2130 as you drift aboard the cargo ship Charon towards Tartarus Gate Waystation. You spend most of your time in suspended animation and are occasionally awoken by the ship’s AI to solve problems – replacing fuses, mopping up spills, unplugging and plugging things in again, the usual. You’re earning Employment Credits rather than money (and who uses money anymore?) – get enough and you’ll be given a job on Tartarus Gate. Now, visual feeds with the lower decks have gone down. Something is moving. You’re six months’ travel from the nearest help. And you really need to impress your employer if you want to be made permanent.

**Notes for players**

This is a standalone adventure scenario developed to be played over three sessions. It comes with pre-generated protagonists for players to choose from for play. A certain amount of buy-in to engage with the scenario as it unfolds is required to make the game enjoyable for all at the table.

Attendance at each session is recommended but not required. Please RSVP for each session you plan to attend. It&#39;s expected each session will be 2.5 - 3 hours in length.

This game uses the Adventure system included with the scenario. It is a light system using 3d6 and will be taught as part of play.

**Content &amp; Trigger Warnings**

This adventure is a space horror and may include the following: graphic descriptions of injuries, body horror, corporate malfeasance, war and rebellion

**Safety Tool:**  X Card, Lines and Veils, Open Door

**Code of Conduct** : All participants agree to abide by the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)

**Breaks** : 5 to 10 minute break at the top of each hour

**Technology:**  Zoom or Streamyard and some sort of online whiteboard, TBD

**Recording:**  Sessions may be recorded if all of the group is okay with it, and I will check at the end if it is okay to share the recording or post to YouTube

Game links and more info will be sent via email one week prior to the game.
