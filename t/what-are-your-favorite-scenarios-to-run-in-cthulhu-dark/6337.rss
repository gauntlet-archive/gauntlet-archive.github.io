    <title>What are your favorite scenarios to run in Cthulhu Dark?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/what-are-your-favorite-scenarios-to-run-in-cthulhu-dark/6337</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to run some Cthulhu Dark one-shots, anybody have thoughts about good scenarios?  (Note: One of these may end up a GCoG session).  

Ideally, if it&#39;s explicitly Lovecraftian, I want something that interrogates andsubverts Lovecraft&#39;s xenophobia, but I&#39;d also be very open to scenarios that work well with the system but don&#39;t engage with mythos at all.  I&#39;ve read Harlem Unbound, but am unsure which scenarios are well suited to tight one shot play, so if anybody here has played them, I&#39;d be curious about that as well.  Thanks folks!</description>

              <p>I ran The Black Chateau from the Trail of Cthulhu scenario book Shadows over Filmland.  It ran really nicely with Cthulhu Dark and I found I didn’t need to do any conversion beforehand, I just ran with it.</p>

              <p>I’ve only run Fairyland by Scott Dorward, but it was extremely creepy (with one particularly disturbing scene that you’d have to decide whether your players would be OK with).</p>
