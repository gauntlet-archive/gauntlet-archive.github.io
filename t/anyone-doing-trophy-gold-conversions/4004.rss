    <title>Anyone Doing Trophy Gold Conversions?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/anyone-doing-trophy-gold-conversions/4004</link>
    <description>Hi! I played a duet of *Trophy Gold* over the weekend with my partner GMing. We made it most of the way through the *Ruined Abbey of St. Clewd* module in the manual, and we LOVED it.

We&#39;d really like to keep playing, but we don&#39;t have a lot of time to find dungeons and convert them into incursions at the moment. Do you know of any places to get more *Trophy Gold* content,  or places to buy existing modules converted into incursions? Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>I haven’t seen other incursions yet, but that would be cool. Working on some of my own, but nothing I can share at this time.</p>
