    <description>Anyone else designing a game using the Forged in the Dark rules? I&#39;d love to hear why other people chose the system and what they&#39;re hoping to make it do for them.

Aside from really enjoying GMing my Blades campaign, I really like how FitD is set up to handle two-tier play. It&#39;s great to have a structured mechanism to look at the wider context of a setting before zooming in on our heroes and their actions. One thing I&#39;m trying to do is make each playbook feel really unique. My game is about animals fighting back against an evil reptilian empire and I want to make the experience of playing a dog distinct compared to playing a cat. Had some success playing around with the action taxonomy and introducing some special actions.

How&#39;s your game coming?</description>

              <p>Yeah, the SRD is good for grabbing particular bits of text from but I wouldn’t use the actual GitHub and develop out like you could do, feasibly, with the Dungeon World  GitHub. I’d absorb and internalise the rules then build yours up from scratch, grabbing little bits verbatim where necessary. I don’t think Quietus has any actual text from the SRD, but it’s definitely a Forged in the Dark game.</p>

              <p>I’m working on two fitd games:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Systems Nominal, a military SF mecha game.</li>
<li>Dragons &amp; Travellers’ Tales, a duet JRPG world building game inspired by Ryuutama, Octopath Traveller, The Burning Wheel, and the SaGa series.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASN had a kind of rough beta version that got discussed on The Gauntlet Podcast last year. It was really hard to abandon the project last year due to work induced burn out, and coming back to it has taken a long time. I am looking to start a rewrite of ASN in the next couple weeks that will be more opinionated and focused because I’ve realized the mecha genre is so fractured you really can’t please a general audience. Instead I’m going to make something with more of a clear premise. Seeing all the sad mech jam games do so much cooler stuff with the genre was inspiring and impressive.</p>
<p>D&amp;TT is almost ready for an alpha release, and I’m pretty excited about how it’s shaping up! I don’t think it’ll have any commercial prospects because it’s a duet game, but I think it’s a strong design.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Many years ago I tried to write a novel. It was set in the nearish future, in a partially flooded southern port city that had been so beset by hurricanes, destroyed infrastructure, poverty, and a highly contagious STD that the entire city was condemned and walled off from the mainland. Picture a more urban version of the community in <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em>.</p>
<p>There were unscrupulous corporations taking advantage of the lack of regulation. There were smugglers bringing goods and people across the new border. There was an underground group of people with that contagious disease, avoiding quarantine. There were the quarantine officers hunting them. There were multiple groups of radicals bombing the other factions. There were pirates. And ghosts, because why not.</p>
<p>The novel itself sucked, but the setting was a beautiful chaotic mess that I’ve always wanted to use for something that didn’t suck. It recently occurred to me that this thing is an FITD hack waiting to happen. Different factions, different crew types, opportunities for so many different crimes… It would translate so well that I almost feel guilty for not having written it yet.</p>

              <p>I’m working on a game about characters surviving/dying in the end of the world. The setting is a dark fantasy world (elves, dwarves, orcs, fighters, wizards, etc). I’m using the Crew mechanics for the Apocalypse (it has a Tier rating, special abilities, reacts to what the characters do, etc), and groups can choose what kind of Apocalypse to play through (world war, plague, demonic invasion, for example).</p>
<p>The mechanics are intended to drive characters to have conflict with other characters as they pursue their goals. One example: instead of an <strong>assist</strong> move to assist another character, characters can get extra dice for their action for free, but all complications of their move are visited on the other characters instead of the acting character. They accomplish what they wanted, but others suffer (like securing the door before the horde gets there, but some people are trapped outside). And if their selfish move failed? That’s a great opportunity for a hard GM move that drives home the horror of their actions. The game is about seeing how far characters will to survive and facing the costs of that survival.</p>

              <p>I’m <em>Forging in the Dark</em> a game tentatively called “Dashpunk”. My goal is to create a setting-less game where players can put a technology at the center of their <em>punk</em> narrative. Players could play everything from “bookpunk” (imagine: slightly more dystopic Catholic church versus Martin Luther &amp; Gutemberg) to more traditional “biopunk” or “survelliancepunk”. In the game, the “power” controls the technology and the players attempt to seize it back, by sabotage, infiltration and symbolic acts of activism (or terrorism, according to the ruling power).</p>
<p>I tried to come up with my rule system for a while but fell in love with Blades in the Dark because of it’s ability to represent different levels of stakes and effects for every roll. While slightly complicated for the GM, the controlled/risky/desperate + great/standard/limited matrix is AMAZING at fictional positioning. I love it because as a GM you can foreshadow to the players what is likely to happen if they fail a desperate/great roll. And there’s a lot of tension in that conversation that can lead to either great gambles or strategic rethinking.</p>
