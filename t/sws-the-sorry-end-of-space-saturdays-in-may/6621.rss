Vincent Baker released an update to a game he was calling **Before the Rebellion** on his Patreon, but he mentioned he was thinking about calling it The Sorry End of Space, which I prefer. It&#39;s 27 pages now and this is the first public-ish playtest document he&#39;s released.

Here&#39;s Vincent&#39;s pitch for it:
**&quot;What I want in a Star Wars game is a different kind of Western. I want the kind where you&#39;ve got the bandit king&#39;s brother in your dinky jail, and you&#39;re an over-the-hill jedi, a drunk, a folk singer, and a crotchety old ex-stormtrooper deserter with a scattergun, and as soon as the bandit king figures this out, him and twenty hardened murderers are going to ride into town, shoot everyone they see, take their brother away, and leave the town burning. That&#39;s what you&#39;ve got and what you&#39;re up against. What&#39;s your play?&quot;**

As Vincent says: &quot;If you&#39;ve been waiting and wishing for a Dogs in the Vineyard reissue, hop on in. This is what it is!&quot;

I am saving a seat for Keith Stetson.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. If you&#39;ve seen The Mandalorian TV show, that&#39;s a good inspiration for what&#39;s happening in the setting.

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

**CW: Temptation, Violence, power abuse.**
**System**  : Dogs in the Vineyard / Before the Rebellion
**Duration**  : Five 3 hour sessions
**Breaks**  : 1 mid-point break per session (10 mins)
**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom
**Recording**  : Yes, but made public only if consent by all the players
**Attendance**  : Joining all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 
**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

<p>I’d call it descended from the game and in some ways, an improvement on the original. There are also a number of wholly new aspects.</p>
