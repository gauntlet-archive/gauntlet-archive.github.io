    <description>*This is the rock and roll future of yesteryear that never was—and nobody wanted.* *It is an intergalactic age of cowboys, outlaws and bandits playing on an interstellar stage.*
*It is a time of hyper-capitalism and a cutthroat gig economy.*
*Unreliable trash-heaps carry scrappy underdogs to their next gig,*
*and corporation freighters lumber across the horizon laden with an empire’s bounty.* *The backstreets of every terraformed metropolis brim with a thousand lonely hearts*
*and a thousand more venal vendettas.*
*The burnt-out wastelands between bright lights are lawless bat countries*
*—anachronistic Americana languishing beneath multiple moons.*
*Madness lies in every direction at every solar hour.*
*These are the music-fuelled, moon-age daydreams of a rebel space age.* This is session one of a two-shot of Orbital Blues where the players are hired to rob an Authority train. It will probably be fine. We will make characters and begin the job.As a system, Orbital Blues lands somewhere between story games and the OSR. Players will portray sad space cowboys who are down on their luck and in need of a job in a way the is reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop, Firefly, The Mandolorian, and maybe even a little Borderlands. It’s hard out here at the edges of the galaxy and things can get pretty lethal.I will send a reminder 1 week before the session. Rules will be taught. Being excited about sad music a plus, but not required. **CW:**  Anxiety, Death, Depression, Gambling, Mental Illness and Associated Traumas, Poverty, Smoking, Substance Abuse, Violence
**System**  : Orbital Blues
**Duration**  : 3 Hours
**Breaks**  : 5-10 minutes approximately on the hour
