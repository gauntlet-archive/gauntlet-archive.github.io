    <title>Maze Rats and Hot Springs Island fused together with revised rules, three broad archetypes, and 72 backgrounds for an open table experience</title>

    <description>[I made this for an upcoming open table game I&#39;m running at my college](https://dreamingdragonslayer.wordpress.com/2019/12/25/maze-rats-v5-3-hot-springs-island-hopping-edition/). Maze Rats has been an excellent, simple OSR game and I&#39;ve enjoyed it immensely, but I ran into some problems that needed to be addressed. For one, there are a lot of people at my table, so having them roll on the same tables made for many similar characters at level 1. So more starting tables. Also, my players missed classes, but I didn&#39;t. So I made three very broad archetypes as a compromise.

I&#39;m running Hot Springs Island with this new ruleset. If you have any tips or resources for running this, let me know.

The whole thing is five pages. Read it and tell me what you think. :)</description>
