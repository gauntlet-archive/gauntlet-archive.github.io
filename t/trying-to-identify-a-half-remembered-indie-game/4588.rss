    <description>Hi - hope I’m in the right channel for this, apologies if not. 

I’ve lost a game and I’m hoping the massed knowledge here will help me find it. It’s a Microscope-like thing, but geographical rather than through time. You’d be building up a map of locations and factions and characters, some on half an index card made into a tent, some on a full index card with one half made into a tent. It was on a site with several other games - I remember white with red headings, and this one in the bottom right of two columns. It felt like a sole designer site rather than a big company. 

I don’t think I imagined it. Does anyone else recognise this?</description>

Definitely looking forward to browsing their catalog, i’m surprised I haven’t run across their stuff before, but that’s what I love about this hobby!</p>
