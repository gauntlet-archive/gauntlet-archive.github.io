The only hitch: I don‚Äôt have any idea what LARPs are good!</p>
<p>Anyone have suggestions for 7-10 player LARPs, especially ones that might be friendly to people new to RPGs at large? Preferably ones that can fit in a 3-4 hour time frame?</p>

          <p>If you‚Äôre after theatre-style with pre-designed characters, these are my suggestions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.paracelsus-games.com/theatrical-experiences/on-display" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>On Display</em></a> by Paracelsus Games is only 6 players (and an NPC for half an hour), but it is a perfect beginner‚Äôs theatreform. The character sheets are simple, yet flavourful. I have a review of it <a href="https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/17/17056.phtml" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144589/The-Face-of-Oblivion?src=Gauntlet" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>The Face of Oblivion</em></a> by Cat Pegg (6-8 players) is a tense larp about how people confront a crisis. Review <a href="https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/16/16321.phtml" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>
</li>
<li>
<em>Hamlet</em> by Shifting Forest Storyworks (8 players). Chuck the rules, there‚Äôs a pretty good game under them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once people are feeling more comfortable, I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.paracelsus-games.com/theatrical-experiences/howling-fire-theomachy" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Howling Fire Theomachy</em></a> by Paracelsus (8 players). It has longer character sheets, but they are well worth it.</p>
<p>On the freeform side, I quite like <em>Will That be All</em> by Graham Walmsley, and <em>Arsenic &amp; Lies</em> looks good. But I‚Äôm more a theatre-style person.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for more, there‚Äôs a list <a href="https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/LARP_Scenarios" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> which is regularly updated, and I can answer questions about quite a few of them.</p>
<p>(Disclosure: I write larps. None of the above are by me. If you‚Äôre interested in the stuff I do, here‚Äôs my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/larpwellington" rel="nofollow noopener">patreon</a>).</p>

          <p><em>Strange Gravity</em> by Jay Treat, if you also want an exercise in distributed authority. This is essentially Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Larp. There is no MC, and all GM-like roles are distributed to players based on their role on the ship. This is a hard game.</p>
<p><em>Symbiosis</em> by Sarah Lynne Bowman, if memory serves. That feels right. This is a game about growing up and developing new emotional capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Tribunal</em>, written by <a href="https://nordiclarp.org/wiki/J._Tuomas_Harviainen" rel="nofollow noopener">J. Tuomas Harviainen</a>, English version done with the help of Jason Morningstar. This is a game about the mechanism of oppression.</p>

          <p>It‚Äôs so exciting to introduce people to live action play! New people are the best players, always. You‚Äôll have a great time. I‚Äôd suggest finding a couple of games that sound really fun to you personally, and then letting your group choose the one that fits their mood and comfort level.</p>
<p>Seconding <em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/202647/Strange-Gravity-BUNDLE" rel="nofollow noopener">Strange Gravity</a></em> for that size group. Maybe not for your first larp, though.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://leavingmundania.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/tribunal_02.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">The Tribunal</a></em> will sort of work with 8-10 and is designed for 12. It‚Äôs a good first larp if people are on board for some intensity.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152644/Still-Life?manufacturers_id=8663" rel="nofollow noopener">Still Life</a></em> is a great first larp and scales well to any size group. It‚Äôs simple and fun and, at its best, a little thought-provoking. The rules say up to 10 but I‚Äôve run it with 20. Needs a facilitator.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2016/WeAreRoommatesNow_Gorman.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">We Are Roommates Now</a></em> is great for up to 8. It is silly and delightfully simple.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/149064/Will-That-Be-All" rel="nofollow noopener">Will That Be All?</a></em> mentioned above is a lovely game for 6-10.</p>
<p><a href="https://thornygames.com/pages/sign" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Sign</em></a> is my favorite ‚Äúfirst larp‚Äù and a beautiful experience, but it is for 4-7. Play it anyway, it is great. Benefits from a facilitator.</p>
<p>All of these games take about two hours, more or less, to play. Maybe three on the outside.</p>
<p>You might also strike gold (see what I did there?) by trolling through the archives of the <a href="http://www.goldencobra.org/archives.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Golden Cobra Challenge</a>, which is full of interesting short freeform larps.</p>
<p>I could recommend some of my own if you want as well.</p>

          <p>These are all great suggestions! Excited to read a bunch of larps over the weekend to see what stands out. Sign was already on my short list (as one of the like 3 larps I‚Äôve read before), On Display looks intriguing, and someone I asked offline also recommended We Are Roommates Now. I really like the sound of Tribunal, though I think we‚Äôll be on the short side of players / won‚Äôt want to get that intense off the bat.</p>
<p>A bunch of these other suggestions look great for a ‚Äú2nd or 3rd time around‚Äù list. Strange Gravity - love me a Star Trek.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be sure to report back with what I decide on. Thank you to everyone so far!</p>
