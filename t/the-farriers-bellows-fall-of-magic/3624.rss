              <p>It may fall outside the intended scope of Farrier’s Bellows but I’m always interested in the evolutionary tree of games. A brief topic about games that inspired the title game and games that were inspired by it would be pretty cool. I think a lot of it might end up being conjecture, since designers don’t always call out their inspiration, but sometimes the genealogy is pretty obvious.</p>

              <p>I enjoy a lot your podcast but I would like to make a suggestion.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to have a subsection with games that come from the game you are reviewing. In the Fall of Magic, there are 2 games that were published in Codex and this could have been a great opportunity to promote the Gauntlet work.</p>
<p>Definitely looking forward to the next episodes.</p>

              <p>I’d say Fall of Magic is probably only slightly more intensive than For the Queen–I think most teens would probably be able to run it with minimal assistance. High school age definitely, middle school it might be a little more iffy.<br>
For what it’s worth, we did once play Fall of Magic with seven players by having some players “double up” and share scenes/characters–I played a Golem and Diana played the magpie that was on my shoulder, and we collaboratively chose locations and scenes for our “character.” In the end I think having young players share scenes and characters that way would probably be more demanding than just running two separate games, but we’ve done large groups of Fall of Magic with some moderate success.</p>

              <p>True. But in this particular group I’m the only one with any desire to facilitate the game and I can’t manage two separate games simultaneously.</p>
<p>But maybe Fall of Magic runs itself? To draw comparisons to two other prompt-based story games, I could probably get my kids playing 2 separate games of For the Queen but not The Quiet Year. For the Queen is so simple, just draw a card and answer the question. Quiet Year is still pretty darn simple but has just enough procedure to the turns that the kids would need someone to guide them through it. The kids like story but prefer me to handle all the mechanics.</p>

<p>I played a day-long session of Fall of Magic where we did the whole map.
