    <description>someone died
and made you
one of them
hunted voices
calling, crying

*you are not alone*

We are ...
disparate characters
linked by a common thread
exploring paths of fate
beyond here and now
sharing lives through time and space

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

This is a playtest of a game design in progress. It&#39;s inspired by TV works such as Orphan Black and Sense8, focusing on themes of identity and community in the face of rogue science and the wonder of life.

The system is Cortex Prime (dice pool) and the Traits being used are Distinctions, Attributes (and Specialties), Approaches (a variation on Roles), and Relationships.

**Note:**  The game requires a willingness to be and to share moments of vulnerability for and between characters. We will discuss this more as a group as part of tone and safety.

The hope is to test out this idea and see if there is interest in scheduling a few more sessions either on-Gauntlet or off-Gauntlet.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m), [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)), Lines &amp; Veils, and the Open Door Policy will be in use.
