          <h2><strong>For the first 48 hours please only sign up if either a) you haven’t played <em>Masks</em> on the Gauntlet or b) you joined the Gauntlet from July '21 onwards.</strong></h2>
<p>This is a two-shot of <em>Masks</em>, a game of young superheroes trying to deal with their powers and relationships. When our team becomes Public Enemy Numero Uno, they have to go on the run to clear their name even as they juggle their personal lives. In our first session we will establish tone &amp; safety, build characters, and then get to playing. There will be a curated selection of playbooks.</p>
<p>Rules will be taught. Attendance at both sessions is strongly encouraged. Sessions are Thursdays in April.</p>
<p><em>Masks: A New Generation is an ENnie-award winning superhero roleplaying game in which a team of young heroes fights villains, saves lives, and tries to figure out who they are—noble paragons? Dark avengers? Or regular kids? All against the backdrop of Halcyon City, the greatest city in the world.</em></p>
<p>We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html">Gauntlet Code of Conduct</a> will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.</p>
<p>If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.</p>
