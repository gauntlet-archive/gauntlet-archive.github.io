    <title>Sealskin [PLAYTEST] (One-Shot)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/sealskin-playtest-one-shot/4759</link>
    <description>Once a selkie swam free in the ocean. Then someone stole their skin and held them captive for many long years. Now, the captor is dead and the skin has been found. The selkie and their surviving family must grapple with what to do next.

A one-session freeform LARP that explores the trauma and loss of a once-captive selkie who is finally free. 

Session 1/1: April 13th, 7:30 pm EST https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M1q-P3dXlPg9Q9Ti3ZA

Game available here: https://iterateonwards.itch.io/sealskin

-----------------------------------

**Content Warning** : Sealskin focuses on the experiences of a selkie who was captured, forced into marriage, and made to raise children with their captor.

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows The Gauntlet’s Inclusivity Policy.

The session is scheduled for around 3 hours and will be recorded and uploaded if everyone agrees to it.</description>
