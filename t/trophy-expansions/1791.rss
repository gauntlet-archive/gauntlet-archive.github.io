    <title>Trophy Expansions</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/trophy-expansions/1791</link>
    <description>Has anyone expanded the options for Trophy character sheets? More occupations, backgrounds, rituals, and drives? I love this system and want to bring it to my students&#39; game group, but there&#39;s over 10 of them and I want to bring some more options to the table. This is a beautifully flexible and simple game mechanic.</description>

              <p>One thing to note about the backgrounds is that there’s two elements there: the thing they used to do, and the reason they CAN’T  do it any more. Not just won’t do, but why they are  proscribed from doing so by their government/society/social group, and it’s always best if that reason is as much of their own making as possible.</p>

              <p>Thanks so much for the kind words, <a class="mention" href="/u/shortaaron">@Shortaaron</a>! I’ve been compiling a list of all the character options (as well as the incursions) to date <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bwxpCnbMntJG2FxLoZn2mkO-LI7gcnyuUwshKZlm5cU/htmlview#" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of making new occupations, I think most anything is on the table. If you can see them as a person desperate enough to go into the forest, they should work. For backgrounds, you have a bit more flexibility, and that’s where I like to put more strange skills.</p>
<p>For rituals specifically, I like to focus on things that aren’t built for combat and that provide some real possibility for backfiring or making things worse, <em>Channel</em> being a great example of that.</p>
<p>I hope that helps, and when you make your own, I’d love to see them!</p>
