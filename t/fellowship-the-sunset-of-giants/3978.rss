    <title>Fellowship: The Sunset of Giants</title>

    <description>The Federation of Carsak has held the people of this land together for over two hundred years, but it will likely not survive the next twelve months. Grumblings about corruption, broken promises and disappearances can be heard in any barroom. And worse, dark rumors have begun to spread of an Apostle that is secretly manipulating the Federation from within. Neighbors no longer trust each other, cities that once traded freely have begun to shut their doors on their neighbors, and there is even a rumor that war may break out between the factions after the latest round of trade negotiations ended without a deal and with heated oaths sworn. 

Against this background a group of agents have been dispatched to try and ferret out the so called Apostle and their network of spies. Will they be in time to prevent the Apostle from completing their goals, and even so, will the Federation survive?

I am saving one spot for any Gauntlet members that are POC, LGBTQIA, or female that wishes to join. There will be a grand total of 4 players at every session and one MC. If you you are interested and meet those qualifications, DM me on Slack. If this spot is not filled 48 hours ahead of the game I will add the next person on the waiting list. (This requirement was met, please add yourself to the waitinglist if interested. It will open to non-Patreon members mid-December.)

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend.

The X-Card and Lines and Veils will be in used for safety tools as well as the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.

We will use Streamyard to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.
