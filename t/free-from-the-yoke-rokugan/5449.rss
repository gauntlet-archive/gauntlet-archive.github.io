    <description>![l5r free from the Yoke Cover|433x500, 75%](upload://lmpSr1ITvx3yuNaPU7Eq2snIJc2.jpeg) 
This is for the August sessions of *Free from the Yoke,* reskinned to use the *Legend of the Five Rings* setting. These sessions will run August/September, with the possibility that we may extend that into October depending on how play goes. Those who sign up for this month will be given right of first refusal when the later sessions are posted.

**General RSVPs Open 6/20**

*Free from the Yoke* is a generational game, built on *Legacy: Life Among the Ruins*. You don’t need to know those rules, however familiarity will be helpful. HOWEVER we will be using the *Legend of the Five Rings* setting, taking place just after the Clan War, the Second Day of Thunder, and the investiture of Toturi I. If you wish to play you should have a decent knowledge of the L5R setting/premise or be willing to spend time reading up on that. In our game Toturi takes the place of the Arbiter and the Clans take the place of the houses.

*Legend of the Five Rings* has ***a lot*** of issues—representation, mashing together unique Asian cultures into a weird Frankenstein-thing, a festishization of Honor as a cultural drive. I’m hoping that a) taking a higher level view of the setting and b) allowing for more player collaboration in defining things will reduce (not eliminate) those issues. We will be able to consider honor as a political tool, used to defend ideologies, entrenched powers, and the cultural systems as a whole—rather than an objective truth.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
