    <description># **For today (4/5), please only sign up if haven&#39;t yet played a regular Gauntlet Calendar series with me as GM.**

***Fantasy noir in a classic setting***

This is for the first of nine sessions of *Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th* *Edition* set in the pulp world of Eberron running Mondays in May and June (2000 US Eastern). Characters will begin at 3d level—we will be playing using Roll20 with the appropriate rules compendiums available. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged. You will be playing a group of private investigators, operating under a patron. In session one I&#39;ll have you flesh that out, establish relationships, discuss safety, and get to playing.

I will provide access to the Eberron and other D&amp;D add-on materials via the Roll20 compendium. While the rules will be taught, recognize these are a little crunchier than the standard Gauntlet fare. OOH I tend to streamline things in play, so if you’re a stickler for rules accuracy—this may not be the game for you. Some familiarity with the Eberron setting and/or D&amp;D basics would be helpful.

You’re welcome to put together your character ahead of time (once we’ve confirmed class picks). I can also create you character if you&#39;d prefer

We will be using Zoom for the video meeting. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
