***Rust Hulks*** is a tabletop roleplaying game about playing space truckers in a grimy science-fiction future. 

In ***Rust Hulks*** , you will play as the crew of a large, derelict spaceship. You will fly around the solar system picking up jobs, earning credits, scraping through hulks, improving your skills, and expanding your ship. On its face, it&#39;s simple; in practice, it gets messy fast: You&#39;re aboard a flying scrapheap halfway to Mars and three of your fuel canisters blow; the crew, while tentative friends, are mostly here for money—when things go real south, what will you do?

Jammi is a special guest for this series.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is after the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

There will be 3 sessions in total (one of them after the Open Gaming Weekend). Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety toolsLines &amp; Veils and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use, as well as post-game feedback after each session.
