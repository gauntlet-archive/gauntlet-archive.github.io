    <description>ZOMBIE WORLD: Enclave.

The all access time for this game is February 17th at 11 pm EST.

Here are four April sessions of ZOMBIE WORLD by Magpie Games.

Zombie World is a PBTA game using cards rather than dice. The players are survivors fighting against the living and the dead for their own place in the world. The game is designed for easy, quick, and intense play.

We&#39;ll use communication and consent tools including the X-Card, Lines/Veils, and the Open Door to help everyone stay comfortable as they try to survive the zombie apocalypse.

This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

CONTENT WARNING: Zombie stories are plague stories. Even with our safety tools, it is very likely that we will be reminded of the real life pandemic as we play.

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. We will use Streamyard and Roll20 to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.

I am reserving a seat for Will H.

Session 1: Sunday April 4th, 2021. 9 am EST.

              <p>You can buy the game on roll20 and it comes with all the decks ready to go.  It takes players just a few “rolls” before they get the hang of it</p>

              <p>I am quite curious how the various decks will be used in online play. Has someone made a template for Roll20, or is there some more primitive solution?</p>
