For those of you who watch Twitch Broadcasts, this Monday at 8PM Eastern I will be starting a monthly *Hearts of Wulin* campaign on [twitch.tv/arvaneleron ](https://t.co/kaZ1m34W4v).  We did a one-shot during the KS campaign and that was well-received. My hope is to use this as an opportunity to advocate for the Gauntlet, storygames, and safety tools. I&#39;ve given them some of our Gauntlet icons, so it should be prominently co-branded (we&#39;ll see). 

I also need to give another shout out to @Mathias who was the first to stream HoW on Twitch! 

This is author Gregory Wilson&#39;s channel. He&#39;s taking care of set up and all the technical side. He has a KS going on right now: https://t.co/R1dhIwXI4z</description>
