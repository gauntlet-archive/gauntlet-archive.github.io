    <description>Bounty of the Week – It&#39;s a Living
Date: January 11, 2020 Session 1 / January 25, 2020 Session 2 / February 8 Session 3
Time: 6:00 pm CST
System: Bounty of the Week
Number of players: 4
Description: 

WANTED: 3-4 DRIVEN CAPABLE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN GET THE JOB DONE. NO QUESTIONS. NO DISINTEGRATIONS. APPLY NOW.

Bounty hunting is a complicated and dangerous profession. If you do well you can make a profitable living, for a while.

You’re a bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe, post Return of the Jedi timeline. You and your companions work to hunt and turn in bounties for pay against the backdrop of the War, collapse of the Empire, and your own personal battles.

This game will use a hack of Monster of the Week (Powered by the Apocalypse) with special thanks to Rich Rogers for showing the way.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

There will be 3 sessions in total.

Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
