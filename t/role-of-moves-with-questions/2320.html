          <p>So almost every PbtA has a version of read a sitch or read a person move. However I wonder what is their role and how to play then.</p>
<p>So my first issue with them is who gets the answer - player or character?<br>
So I understand that by looking at someone you can guess if they lie or tell the truth, you could guess how is other person feeling, but questions like ‚Äúwhat do you wish I do?‚Äù ‚Äúhow could I get you to ‚Ä¶ tell me where have you hidden the gold‚Äù it is next to impossible to learn that in-character from looking at someone. If the fictional position is that Brainer reads someone‚Äôs thoughts sure, they can learn that in-character, but not from looking at someone.<br>
So how do you give answers to such questions - do you answer directly to the player or try to answer it to the character they are playing?</p>
<p>One thing also often bothers me - after players asks ‚Äúhow can I get you to tell me ‚Ä¶‚Äù, if they do it, should I ask for Persuade roll or not?</p>
<p>My second issue with them is that often my players approach them as awareness checks and almost exclusively ask question ‚Äúwhat else is hidden here?‚Äù as if I as MC were hiding plot behind awareness checks. Very rarely they ask me ‚Äúwho is the biggest threat?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat is my enemy true position?‚Äù. I remember someone telling me that it is better when they don‚Äôt ask those questions because then it is easier, they don‚Äôt have to deal with strong enemies.<br>
From my perspective as MC the read a sitch moves allow players to ask questions for what they are interested about and I love that it gives them power to create interesting and dangerous environment before the encounter. How do you convey that to the players that moves that ask questions are not there to ‚Äúuncover‚Äù MC secrets but to create interesting things or am I wrong and I should have a ton of secrets?</p>

          <p>I was actually thinking about the same thing a while ago.<br>
I have been leaving out ‚Äúmoves with questions‚Äù in my PbtA games.<br>
In games I run, I usually just tell players what their characters should perceive/know, or turn it back to them and ask what they think their character perceived/knew.<br>
I guess the questions are good if the MC doesn‚Äôt know how to proceed with the story, and they give them and the player a shared prompt.</p>

<p>Definitely the player answering. They can (and probably should) couch it in fiction, but the move is facilitating a player-to-player (or player-to-GM, for NPCs) conversation.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First of all: if you‚Äôre talking about Read a Person in AW, there‚Äôs an assumption in the move that you‚Äôll ask questions relevant to the charged interaction (and if there isn‚Äôt a charged interaction at all, you can‚Äôt make the move at all).  So, if we‚Äôre playing out a shouting match about whether or not we poison Dremmer‚Äôs well, you Reading a Person and asking ‚Äúhow could I get you to tell me where you‚Äôve hidden the gold‚Äù is completely out of left field and off-topic, and I as player or GM would call shenanigans.</p>
<p>But if our charged interaction <em>does</em> involve you trying to suss out where the gold is, then it‚Äôs relevant question and, frankly, an empathic, sharp person <em>can</em> figure that sort of thing out ‚Äújust by looking.‚Äù  Cuz you‚Äôre not just <em>looking</em>, you‚Äôre <em>reading</em>.  You‚Äôre seeing how they respond, where their eyes go, etc. All sorts of micro-interactions that aren‚Äôt easy to recreate at the table, and all sorts of context that ‚Äújust looking at them‚Äù doesn‚Äôt convey.  The move simulates that stuff.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs say that you know I‚Äôve buried the gold somewhere. We‚Äôre having a charged conversation where that‚Äôs relevant.  The fact that you‚Äôre spending 1 hold to ask how you could get me to tell you where it is means that I have not yet told you where it is, and that you think I‚Äôm not going to tell you. You spending that that 1 hold to ask represents your knowledge of me and what I value, how I‚Äôm likely to react to certain approaches, your ability to read my facial expressions, predict my emotional responses. All very legitimate. Professional salespeople, therapists, politicians, counselors, and educators make a living off that sort of thing.</p>
<p>As for my answer to you, it prompts me to think about what <em>would</em> get me to give up the location of the gold. My answer has to be honest but it doesn‚Äôt have to be easy to fulfill. ‚ÄúHuh. You could make a credible threat against Iris or Toyota, that‚Äôd get me to spill. But it‚Äôd have to be credible, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù</p>
<p>Now, if I‚Äôm the GM and you ask me that question about an NPC, I‚Äôm might follow up with ‚Äúhow do you figure that out?‚Äù  Or I might frame it as ‚Äúyou see a little trinket on his desk, one of those metal flowers that Iris makes, and it dawns on you she‚Äôs his soft spot. Make a credible threat against her, and he‚Äôll cave for sure.‚Äù</p>
<p>As for whether you need to make a Persuade/Seduce/Manipulate roll once you know what they want‚Ä¶ in AW, I‚Äôd definitely say yes.  Read a Person is letting you know what would constitute ‚Äúa reason‚Äù (as in ‚Äúgive them a reason‚Äù). But it doesn‚Äôt mean you sell it well. That‚Äôs the difference between Sharp (figuring out the reason) and Hot (making the play).</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt have a copy of <em>Apocalypse World</em> handy, it might be worth your while getting one.

          <p>In trad games, the idea is that a roll usually equals to couple seconds in the narrative. Even if that is not stated in the text, we tend think of it that way, because combat systems made us used to it.</p>
<p>Now, in PbtA games (at least the ones I run) rolls often represent a much longer chunk of time. So to Read a Person in AW, a quick glance won‚Äôt do the trick. You need to observe the person, or go and talk to them for a bit. Basically spend some in-game time for your character to be able to learn the stuff the move represents. Then the <em>player</em> gets the answers as per move. The <em>character</em> gets the idea of the answer, but they also got a bunch of other info. Stuff that is not really relevant to the plot.</p>
<p>So this all goes back to when will the move <em>trigger</em>. Simply looking at someone would not trigger the move in my game. Same for looking around / awareness checks. Just because you look around, doesn‚Äôt mean you get a roll. I would handle a quick glance to check the place out quickly with saying something along the lines: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing out of ordinary here, the place seems relatively safe.‚Äù</p>
<p>As for getting answers for stuff that <em>doesn‚Äôt make sense</em> like the before mentioned "how could I get your character to __?‚Äô‚Äù Just imagine a way of how the character could get that info. Maybe they asked some probing questions, maybe they observed the target doing something that signifies what they want. In my games, you or the player don‚Äôt have to specify exactly how they got that info, as long as it was possible. It‚Äôs kinda Schrodinger‚Äôs narrative, or even better a movie. You don‚Äôt see the character doing all the legwork to find out something, it would be boring. Instead, there is an establishing shot that the legwork takes place, and then the audience just accepts the outcomes.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes more sense‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>Lots of good answers here; I particular like <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jeremy_strandberg">@Jeremy_Strandberg</a>‚Äôs take on it, here.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll make two other notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I think that if a ‚Äúreading‚Äù move reveals an NPC‚Äôs soft spot, I would assume, by default, that following through on that should be an automatic success, not something you‚Äôd need to roll for. That‚Äôs the whole point of getting that answer: you now know what would move that character. (There may be situations where that‚Äôs not the case, like in Jeremy‚Äôs example where the new information you learned is really just leverage, but usually I‚Äôd want such information to be really impactful; I think that makes for more clarity and better gaming, too.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love, love, love reading moves. However, I find that many PbtA games (especially Dungeon World and its descendants) don‚Äôt give the moves any clear grounding, in terms of the game‚Äôs genre/style and the move‚Äôs fictional trigger. AW‚Äôs reading moves are crystal clear to me: it‚Äôs <em>that</em> moment in the movie, you know? Same goes for <em>deep brain scan</em>, <em>things speak</em>, and so forth - they‚Äôre dramatically and stylistically very clear and very strong. DW‚Äôs reading moves, in comparison, are confusing and unclear: when do we actually roll this? Can we roll again? So, to me, it does depend a great deal on the design specifics. I‚Äôd find ‚ÄúDiscern Realities‚Äù pretty confusing, too, in other words.</p>

          <p>Since I am an extremely low prep/high improv MC I find the question moves fantastic because they end up making me think about something in a way I wasn‚Äôt expecting. Things like <em>Gaze Into The Abyss</em> and <em>Discern Realities</em> always get my creative juices running and get me thinking outside of the box.</p>

          <p>Reading moves are excellent in low prep situations as well, yes. Very true!</p>
<p>I played a handful of sessions in a Fallen Empires game which were very low prep and often introduced new characters and new players.</p>
<p>It was amazing how much a few ‚Äúreading‚Äù moves would flesh out our situations and characters. We‚Äôd learn about the physical environment, but also about the characters‚Äô desires and history. One reading move I made (‚Äúthings speak‚Äù) started one of the biggest plot threads of the campaign, when we discovered that a character‚Äôs sister had been trapped in the body of a camel.</p>
