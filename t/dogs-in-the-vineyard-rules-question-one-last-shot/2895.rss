    <title>Dogs in the Vineyard rules question: one last shot?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/dogs-in-the-vineyard-rules-question-one-last-shot/2895</link>
    <description>My adversary can&#39;t See my Raise and won&#39;t escalate, so I&#39;m winning the conflict. It&#39;s guaranteed.

BUT 

he shot me in the process, giving me some 3d10 fallout. And now I&#39;m angry. I want to retribute in kind.

Question: can I smoke his ass one last time, and *THEN* win the conflict and whatever was at stake? If so, how do I do it? By the rules, it doesn&#39;t seem possible, as conflicts end when someone can&#39;t match a raise, or gives. Right?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Yes, the Last Shot rule idea works against a central design feature in Dogs, which is that you always have the option to Give instead of taking Fallout. That’s really key to making the premise of the game work!</p>
<p>Having said that, don’t forget that Dogs’ rule for GMs is “say yes or roll the dice”. If a “can I hurt him?” follow up conflict sounds uninteresting (and it probably is!), the GM should just say, “yes, you shoot him,” after the conflict ends. If there’s a good reason you couldn’t… then THAT might be an interesting conflict, but generally, I’d just say it’s good and done - he’s in front of you, you pull the trigger… we all know how that ends.</p>
<p>Edit: And if it’s a PC vs. PC conflict, don’t forget that you can apply “say yes or roll the dice” as a player, too. Sometimes, “I just stand there. Do you really shoot me, just like that?” might be just the right thing.</p>

<p>Would that Last Shot idea (and the Revenge bit) infringe some actual rule in some way? I think it contradicts Giving? Like, you’re supposed to Give instead of Seeing whenever you want and avoid the fallout right? So the Last Shot woud break that I guess?</p>

<p>Personally, I wouldn’t use a Last Shot rule. The conflict you had was finished up and going for a final shot is basically inviting a new conflict where you’re trying to hurt the person.  That changes the stakes and the person who lost the previous one should be able to go into that new one and not get fallout just dumped on them.</p>
