Hello The Gauntlet (Do community members have a special name? :thinking:),

This not only my first post here ever but it is also about my very first foray in game design and publishing.

This community was recommended to me by several very good people including [Jason Pitre](https://youtu.be/9-esxPyTCuk) and [Kevin Lovecraft](https://youtu.be/fQEwX18o85s), so here I am.

As mentioned in the title of this post, my game is &quot;[Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic Inventorying](https://rolistespod.com/2020/05/15/announcing-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying/)&quot;.

**What is this game?**

This project is a storytelling GM-less game for 3 to 6 players, designed to be played in a few hours with polyhedral dice and no preparation.

It is comparable to fan-favourites games like Once Upon A Time and The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen.

This game is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to encumbrance rules and tropes commonly found in our beloved dungeon-crawling tabletop roleplaying games. 

The game starts as the *Adventurers* just defeated their final foes and they discover what wondrous items.

However, before embarking on their journey home, they must decide what to keep or throw away.

If *Adventurers* hold-on to possessions which “spark joy”, they are likely to feel invigorated and satisfied for the rest of their lives…

…but letting go of less emotionally-charged, often more useful  *Belongings,*  might prove to be a deadly mistake on their *Journey Home*.

**What is going on with it?**
I am currently running as many online sessions as I can while consolidating the base rules. 

My goal is to publish a Quickstart PDF by the end of 2020 ahead of Dragonmeet in London.

Then, I want to expand it with a new play mode and other features into an extended version for a Kickstarter campaign in late 2021/early 2022.

**Why post about it here?**
Well, I am obviously keen to raise awareness about this game but what I am really after is more people to join my online sessions.

I run weekly sessions (7.30pm BST / 2.30 EST) via the [London RPG Community Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/LondonRPGCommunity/) but more importantly...

...I will be running [ELEVEN SESSIONS](https://gama.configio.com/search?st_t=2109&amp;st_ti=2791&amp;srt=startdate) of the game as part of Origins Online.

It is very exciting but:
- I am anxious about whether players will sign up to these;
- I have very limited experience running games for a convention;

So any advice about the above, help in spreading the word about these sessions or volunteer to join one of my online sessions ahead of Origins would be very very very welcome. :heartbeat:

Cheers

<p>…why not do a Kickstarter to raise the money for for the graphic design?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The plan is to have a Kickstarter later for an expanded edition. The current has a section towards the end explaining what it might included (i.e. physical print, card decks, new classes…). My view is that a KS requires a lot of things to be really successful.</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to build up a follow up before engaging into one</li>
<li>It would involve too much upfront costs (i.e.art to be included in promotional material)</li>
<li>It would be too stressful at this stage</li>
<li>The game deserves a solid KS campaign which meets the above (again that’s the plan)</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan was initially to cover the upfront costs myself for the current edition but my unemployment lasted longer than expected. It’s been more than a year.</p>
<p>I also got very interesting advice as part of Jason Pitre’s monthly Game Design Lounge. Several designers there highlighted how Itchio was a platform where the community was much more supportive of projects still in development. I must their Sale-With-Goal tool (sometimes called Itchfunding) is simple to use and appropriate to my needs. The next edition (not the expanded one yet), which my graphic designer Francita Soto, will be the subject of another Itchfunding to help cover the cost for additional interior art.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was quite surprised about how it started with a joke but turned out into something rather interesting with storytelling relying on retcons/flashbacks and characters defined almost only by the objects they carry.</p>

<p>I’ll probably develop addons. I had the idea too late this year, but I think I’ll do a Star Wars inspired one for May the 4th next year. I should playtest it as part of one of The Gauntlet Star Wars Saturday/Sunday.</p>

              <p>It’s been a long time since I gave any update here.</p>
<p>I apologise for that.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://rolistespod.com/2021/03/07/meet-the-editor-of-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying/" rel="nofollow noopener">Update originally posted on The Rolistes Website</a>)</p>
<h3>Meet Our Editor!</h3>
<p>We now have a great editor working on “Paris Gondo – The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying”!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisSSims" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>Chris S. Sims</strong> </a> is a <a href="https://chrisssims.com/publications/" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>tabletop RPG industry veteran</strong> </a> born in the US.</p>
<p>He lives in Austria, which really helps with timezones.</p>
<p>His professional experience goes back to Dungeons &amp; Dragon 3.5. This includes working on both the 4th and 5th editions of the “Player’s Handbook”.</p>
<p>This should make up for my own shortcomings with Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p>More recently, he contributed to the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/sourcebooks/acquisitions-incorporated" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>Acquisitions Incorporated</strong> </a>” campaign book developed by Wizards of the Coast in partnership with <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>Penny Arcade</strong> </a>.</p>
<p>That is a great bonus towards achieving the comedic tone of our own “Paris Gondo – The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying”.</p>
<p>I was excited to work with Chris and he really did not disappoint.</p>
<p>His work is top-notch.</p>
<h3>Where Are We Now?</h3>
<p>Chris already completed a review of the introduction and rules.</p>
<p>I need to thoroughly read and review the updated text.</p>
<p>My feedback will likely be followed by a little bit more work from Chris.</p>
<p>In parallel, our “Replay” will require its own review to update any terminology which might have changed.</p>
<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<p>Thanks to the fast-paced work of Chris, we are still technically on track with our initial schedule.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned last month, I won’t be able to proceed right away with hiring a graphic designer. This is due to my current financial situation.</p>
<p>I consulted seasoned game designers as part of <a href="https://twitter.com/Genesisoflegend/status/1343447338556112896" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>Jason Pitre’s excellent monthly Game Design Lounge</strong> </a>.</p>
<p>Based on their advice, I decided to proceed as follows.</p>
<p>I will release in March a “text-only” version of the game on <a href="https://rolistespod.itch.io/?ac=6hKcoR9Jch" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>The Rolistes Itch.io store</strong> </a> at a modest cost. This cost will be deductible from digital purchases of the future version featuring art.</p>
<p>The sales of this version will go towards paying for the next steps: graphic design and art.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will request a quote from a graphic designer. This way, I will proceed with that step as soon as my personal savings and my sales are enough to cover that cost.</p>
<p>Depending on those circumstances, I hope to follow this schedule</p>
<ul>
<li>March 2021: “Text-only” version on <a href="http://Itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Itch.io</a>
</li>
<li>April 2021: Graphic Design</li>
<li>May 2021: Improved version on <a href="http://Itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Itch.io</a>
</li>
<li>June 4th, 2021: Small print run for UK Games Expo (if pandemic allows)</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, I am interested in reading your opinions on the above course. Feel free to <a href="mailto:rolistespod@gmail.com">email me</a> or contact via other means.</p>
<p>Also, you can help me finance the above through The Rolistes <a href="https://www.patreon.com/RolistesPod" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>Patreon</strong> </a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/rolistespod/" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>PayPal</strong> </a> or <a href="https://ko-fi.com/rolistespod" rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>Ko-Fi</strong> </a>.</p>
<h3>That’s It</h3>
<p>It is a bit sad to be unable to cover myself the upfront costs.</p>
<p>However, the project keeps progressing meaningfully.</p>
<p>The prospect of releasing even a “text-only” version is exciting.</p>
<p>It should be an opportunity to raise awareness about the game. Hopefully, it will get more people to play it.</p>
<p>I cannot wait.</p>
<p>See you next month.</p>
<p>Take good care of yourselves. Stay Safe. Have good games.</p>

<p>Origins Online is cancelled, but I decided to answer the call of Dennis Furia who is encouraging people from the “Origins Games Fair: Games Master Group” to run their games independently and to do so while supporting Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>I will be running half a dozen two hours sessions of my game, <a href="https://rolistespod.com/2020/05/15/announcing-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying/" rel="nofollow noopener">“Paris Gondo – The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying“</a>, from Friday June 19 to Sunday June 21st.</p>
<p>An extensive description of the game can be found <a href="https://rolistespod.com/2020/05/15/announcing-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>To register, please complete BOTH OF THESE TWO STEPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>select a session in our <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/bdxqik2yn9ysvx3e" rel="nofollow noopener">Sign Up Doodle</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AND email me at parisgondo at gmail dot com</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope the process will be straightforward but I am new at organising such thing.</p>
<p>Those sessions are entirely free, but I would be grateful for any donation to the following fundraising towards the NAACP Empowerment Programs:</p>
<p><a href="https://donate.tiltify.com/@rolistespod/sparkjoy-naacp-fundraiser" rel="nofollow noopener">#SparkJoy / Eliminate Racial Hatred &amp; Racial Discrimination</a></p>
<p>If you prefer to support Black Lives Matters in another way, the <a href="https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/#" rel="nofollow noopener">Ways You Can Help Black Lives Matters</a> webpage is full of other means, including non-financial one, as well as alternative organisations to pick and resources to educate ourselves.</p>
<p>I look forward to playing with you.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>However, it is really not important at the moment.</p>
<h3>What matters…</h3>
<p>Black Lives Matter!</p>

              <p>Awesome! I’ll see if I can get into a session.</p>
<p>Years ago I read this document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWMcpGKLynl1kZY4og8_Itsch5HTols3GSzPK1Xgoxk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWMcpGKLynl1kZY4og8_Itsch5HTols3GSzPK1Xgoxk/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>It was hugely helpful for when I started running con games (and online sessions). While there’s some procedural stuff specific to Games on Demand, there’s a lot of good suggestions.</p>
<p>A few things I remember which changed my approach:<br>
*Being really clear about expectations at the start (what kind of game this is going to be, what’s the tone, etc)<br>
*Laying out for your players what the structure of the session is going to be. (take a break at X time, first part is character creation, we’ll wrap a little early so you can make it to your next session, etc).<br>
*Planning to keep an eye out on the time and warning players than when you get to the last half hour you may “hard frame” some things to bring all the threads together.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more in the document.</p>

<p>Hello The Gauntlet (Do community members have a special name? <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=9" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:">),</p>
<p>This not only my first post here ever but it is also about my very first foray in game design and publishing.</p>
<p>This community was recommended to me by several very good people including <a href="https://youtu.be/9-esxPyTCuk" rel="nofollow noopener">Jason Pitre</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/fQEwX18o85s" rel="nofollow noopener">Kevin Lovecraft</a>, so here I am.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the title of this post, my game is “<a href="https://rolistespod.com/2020/05/15/announcing-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying/" rel="nofollow noopener">Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic Inventorying</a>”.</p>
<p><strong>What is this game?</strong></p>
<p>This project is a storytelling GM-less game for 3 to 6 players, designed to be played in a few hours with polyhedral dice and no preparation.</p>
<p>It is comparable to fan-favourites games like Once Upon A Time and The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen.</p>
<p>This game is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to encumbrance rules and tropes commonly found in our beloved dungeon-crawling tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
<p>The game starts as the <em>Adventurers</em> just defeated their final foes and they discover what wondrous items.</p>
<p>However, before embarking on their journey home, they must decide what to keep or throw away.</p>
<p>If <em>Adventurers</em> hold-on to possessions which “spark joy”, they are likely to feel invigorated and satisfied for the rest of their lives…</p>
<p>…but letting go of less emotionally-charged, often more useful  <em>Belongings,</em>  might prove to be a deadly mistake on their <em>Journey Home</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What is going on with it?</strong><br>
I am currently running as many online sessions as I can while consolidating the base rules.</p>
<p>My goal is to publish a Quickstart PDF by the end of 2020 ahead of Dragonmeet in London.</p>
<p>Then, I want to expand it with a new play mode and other features into an extended version for a Kickstarter campaign in late 2021/early 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Why post about it here?</strong><br>
Well, I am obviously keen to raise awareness about this game but what I am really after is more people to join my online sessions.</p>
<p>I run weekly sessions (7.30pm BST / 2.30 EST) via the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/LondonRPGCommunity/" rel="nofollow noopener">London RPG Community Meetup</a> but more importantly…</p>
<p>…I will be running <a href="https://gama.configio.com/search?st_t=2109&amp;st_ti=2791&amp;srt=startdate" rel="nofollow noopener">ELEVEN SESSIONS</a> of the game as part of Origins Online.</p>
<p>It is very exciting but:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am anxious about whether players will sign up to these;</li>
<li>I have very limited experience running games for a convention;</li>
</ul>
<p>So any advice about the above, help in spreading the word about these sessions or volunteer to join one of my online sessions ahead of Origins would be very very very welcome. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/heartbeat.png?v=9" title=":heartbeat:" class="emoji" alt=":heartbeat:"></p>
