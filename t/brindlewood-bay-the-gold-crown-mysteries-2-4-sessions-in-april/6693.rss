    <title>Brindlewood Bay: The Gold Crown Mysteries 2 (4 sessions in April)</title>

    <description>*For the first 24 hours, please only sign up for this game if you’re currently playing in the first Gold Crown Mysteries game. One spot in the game is reserved for a returning player.* 

Brindlewood Bay mixes Murder She Wrote and Lovecraft, cozy mystery and cosmic horror. You play elderly women whose enthusiasm for mystery novels leads them to solve real-life murders - but the clues you uncover also begin to reveal a supernatural conspiracy underlying and connecting the cases you solve.

This series continues a March game, and the Mavens have already solved some crimes and begun to expose the Dark Conspiracy lurking in Brindlewood Bay. New players are very welcome to join for one or more sessions, and the episodic nature of the story should make it easy to jump in. Please sign up for all sessions you&#39;d like to attend. My plan is to keep this going as an open table until the Mavens confront the ultimate Void Mystery in a few months, and if you play in this session you’ll also have priority access for future games. 

Sessions will be played on StreamYard and recorded if all players consent. The series will consist of four three-hour sessions with breaks on the hour. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door policy as safety tools, and the game will run according to the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. Players don’t need to know the rules, which will be taught during play.

Open access sign up time is 8.30am 17 March AEDT.
