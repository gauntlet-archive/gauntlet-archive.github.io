          <p>I present to you the <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/06/08/crowdfunding-collection-143" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>new Crowdfunding Collection #143, including every tabletop rpg project started between 05/17 and 05/24</b></a>.</p>
<p>This collection spans back over 4 weeks and doesn’t include the last week. I still going to publish it, as next week more projects will have ended, and my current health state prevents me to add a full week of projects to complete it.<br>
I hope you still enjoy the overview, and if you see a project you are interested in, act fast, it might be soon ending!</p>
<p><b>The Littlebox RPGs</b> projects offers two roleplaying games in one small, tarotset sized box. The games are narrative, don’t require a gamemaster and are designed to be able to be played right out of the deck. The game Villagesong addresses change and leadership and the game Our Mundane Supernatural Life addresses the challenged of day to day challenges. I like the games, the concept and recommend you having a look at the project. Then there’s <b>Tian Shang: Lone Wolf Fists</b>, which serves ones need for high-octane KungFu action in a post-apocalyptic world. The system is designed to be fast and dynamic, while the setting reminds me of Fist of the North Star. Cool. Then there is <b>The Epic of Dreams RPG</b>. The game offers a fantasy setting and more interestingly some quite interesting mechanics. Like, you don’t need a character sheet and the system is based on guessing a number. Which might sound aloof, but it appears the game has been written and tested, thus I do recommend it.<br>
If you are looking for a solo game, check out <b>Red Bean: Dragon Slayer</b>. It uses a poker deck with comic illustrations and I am strongly tempted to back it.<br>
Larpers should check out the <b>Crescendo Giocoso Ritornello</b> collection of 12 small Larps. I backed, received and enjoyed the predessesor to the project, and thus wholeheartedly recommend it.<br>
There are many more cool projects. For example the dynamic library dungeon <b>The Stygian Library</b>, the nice looking <b>HYPERBOREA DICE</b> and the <b>FATUM</b> set of cards. Fatum allows to for the creation of backgrounds for characters in fantasy games in general, as well as D&amp;D 5E specifically. Something that I consider very cool, and where I am tempted.<br>
You can find those, and many more project, here:</p>
