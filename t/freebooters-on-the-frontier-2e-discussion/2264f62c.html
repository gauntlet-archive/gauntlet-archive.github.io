<p>I would love to hear how it goes.</p>

</aside>
<p>It went poorly, alas <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"> They decided not to engage with the prison-dungeon for the most part. The rogue on the inside never tried to escape and instead sold the position of his companions to the torturer because he was too afraid. In the meanwhile the rest of the party meandered a lot. After playing for two hours they decided to finally check out the prison, but we ended our session there.<br>
Next time maybe!</p>
<p>Here is the prison I created with the help of the dungeon tables anyway:</p>
<p><strong>Dwarven Prison</strong><br>
size: <em>medium (9 areas)</em><br>
themes: <em>abjuration</em>, <em>torture</em>, <em>control</em><br>
alignment: <em>evil</em><br>
safety: <em>unsafe</em></p>
<p>areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Entrance/Checkpoint</strong>: A circular room with a guardroom at the center. Two guards are always stationed here. Beside the entrance, three corridors branch out of this room: west to cellblocks A and B, north to the common area, and est to the barracks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cell block A</strong>: 8 cells in two rows. In each just a dirty pail and some hay on the floor. A lockable door made of iron bars for each. There are 3 trained guard dogs chained near the entrance of the block, were the guard usually sits. An air shaft in the last cell on the left side has been enlarged to permit a difficult crawl to the adjacent cell block B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cell block B</strong>: 8 cells in two rows. In each just a dirty pail and some hay on the floor. A lockable door made of iron bars for each. Signs of recent violence: a lone tooth lays in a small pool of blood in a corner of the room. The owner of said tooth is lying on the floor of his cell grumbling fiercely. He had a scuffle with one of the guards recently, and he pocketed one of the keys during the brawl. Sadly, it doesn‚Äôt open his cell. An air shaft in the last cell on the right side has been enlarged to permit a difficult crawl to the adjacent cell block A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Common area</strong>: A huge room for the prisoner to hang out during their free time, if they have been collaborative. There are tables to play cards or dices, and space enough to walk or exercise. The main entrance to the tortures chamber is hidden behind a fake wall here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mess hall</strong>: A pretty large room with sturdy wooden tables and benches. A faint smell of stale food hangs in the air. On the floor there are small but frequent holes that form a regular pattern. A mechanism just outside the door of the room releases paralysing gas from this holes to quell any eventual fight. Under one of the tables there is a small piece of parchment that was stuck there with an unknown sticky substance. Scrawled badly on it there is a map of the complex (without the torture chamber) that shows the secret passage dug from the abandoned cell block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Barracks</strong>: a series of small rooms with bunk beds and tiny warehouses. The torturer and his pet rat are usually found here, with about six other guards, give or take. There are various kinds of common gear to be found here, including ropes, manacles, batons and a couple sticks that produce a dense, acrid smoke when burned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abandoned cell block</strong>: this area half-collapsed a long time ago, and now is used by the prison staff as a temporary warehouse. Old furniture and broken soon-to-be-repaired-but-actually-forgotten-forever miscellanea lays scattered around. The musty atmosphere hides a bad smell of putrefaction coming from one of the cells: a long and very narrow tunnel is hidden behind some loose stones in the wall, and about thirty meters in a rotten corpse bars the way forward almost completely‚Ä¶ But the light at the end can be seen shining in the distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dump</strong>: A huge crevasse more than half filled with smelly waste. It‚Äôs easy to spot the remains of some prisoners half buried in the rubbish. Some blind, aggressive birds circle around the area and suddenly come down to fish something out of the trash. There is a trap door here that is connected to the hidden tortures chamber, but it is locked from the inside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tortures chamber</strong>: the door to this chamber is a big slab of smooth rock hidden behind a face wall in the common room, and is engraved with dwarves runes. The torturer has an attuned stone on himself that unlocks the door. Behind it there is a classic tortures chamber, with cages dangling from the ceiling, a table with leather straps in the middle, and various ‚Äòinstruments‚Äô to extract the truth from prisoners the hard way. When the torture has finished is bloody work, he can dispose of the used up victim by the bolt hole that goes straight to the dump. Some valuable possessions of said victims is kept here, for safe keeping of course.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I left myself a lot of stuff to improvise, especially about the prisoners and guards residing in the cells. I also under-utilised the abjuration theme, but we are playing a fairly low magic setting right now and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to incorporate it well. I am also not happy with the common room, because I really have no clue what should be there.</p>
<p>EDIT: here is the map I scribbled in 10 minutes before the session‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I wonder if you plan to discuss ‚ÄúWest Marches‚Äù style games in your text at all?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ben Robbins‚Äô original West Marches blog posts were one of the things that fed into my conception of the game, especially his use of ability score damage. If we take these three points from that kickstarter as a fair summation of ‚ÄúWM style‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First, there is no regularly scheduled session time: instead, each session is determined individually by the players.</li>
<li>Second, there is no standard party: instead, parties are drawn from a player pool of 10 or more players.</li>
<li>Third, there is no overarching plot: instead, the players decide where to go and what to do, venturing out into a vast, dangerous expanse of uncharted wilderness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>‚Ä¶<em>Freebooters</em> is designed primarily around the third, because that‚Äôs the style of game I grew up with in the late 70s/early 80s. The first two points are about playgroup organization, which might be worth addressing in the main text. I‚Äôll certainly put it on the list of things to consider including.</p>

          <p>Cool prison/dungeon!</p>
<p>I think I might have the cell blocks connecting to the Common Room, instead of the entrance. To move the prisoners from their cells to the Mess Hall every meal means they would have to go through the entrance chamber and see freedom right on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>I could see the Common room being broken into a couple of rooms.</p>
<ol>
<li>A processing room</li>
<li>Warden‚Äôs quarters/office</li>
<li>It might be fun to have some sort of <em>super tracker</em> monster penned up somewhere too. To use just in case a prisoner escapes. Maybe under the control of the warden?</li>

<p>Re: abjuration as a theme, maybe the warden is an abjurer who maintains warding spells as security measures ‚Äì alarm glyphs at certain points, or ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù spells that seal off certain areas with arcane force. Even better if the warden has a scrying sphere in their office, from which they can observe the rest of the prison. I bet if you roll up the torturer and warden as evil-aligned NPCs, their traits and motivation will give you some ideas about their relationship, as well as other aspects of the dungeon.</p>

          <p>Here‚Äôs my proposed solution to one little problem with West Marches in FotF.</p>
<p>Problem</p>
<ol>
<li>World Creation is a great bit of Session zero, and is a great way to get everyone invested in the setting.</li>
<li>West Marches play expects 10+ players.</li>
<li>World Creation in FotF with 10 players feels like it might get‚Ä¶ long; and boring.</li>
<li>Also, not everyone will be at Session Zero, and so therefore may not be as invested in the setting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution: in the first session, we will create the 2-3 Lost Civilizations. We will only create a new civilization if the narrative calls for it; or if we get an 8th+ player. (8th is just a number I came up with. Feels right).</p>
<p>Every session thereafter, if we get new players, the new players get to add one new Region and one new Landmark to the map. GM(s) will track the regions and landmarks associated with each player, and be sure to include something related to one or more of those Frontier features in that session‚Äôs play.</p>
<p>With that, I think I‚Äôm ready to launch into a West Marches FotF game.</p>

          <p>I ran based on the original Funnel World (not sure how much 00 diverges now). I used the ‚ÄúEscape from the Plague Pits‚Äù starter. I ran it at a con. I believe I had 3 or 4 players. Each player created two 0-level characters. It was pretty fun.</p>
<p>Not sure where you got the idea there had to be 12 players?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what I would do again:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Give them pre-generated characters, instead of having them roll up. And give them 3 or even better 4 each. We spent too much time generating. Also the generation of the characters invests the players in them, so they may be more cautious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were a couple of times when a character should have died; and I held back. I should have killed that character right off. There‚Äôs multiple places in the funnel starter where they can meet now PCs (the jail area is one).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating more of a map to start (but with blank spaces) would have been useful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Best of luck with running your funnel!</p>

          <p>That was a mistake on my part. I meant 12+ characters not players (3-4 characters per player). I actually ran Servants of the Cinder Queen twice with different groups using 3 players per characters and it went well for the most part. Although most lost some characters or some of them went down almost immediately in the first room and the bulk of the game involved them trying to get out of the initial pit. I‚Äôd probably start it from the caves with a cave-in if I ran it again as a funnel.</p>
<p>I tried doing a location ‚Äúsiege‚Äù Evil Dead/Night of the Living Dead funnel recently online and it didn‚Äôt go quite as well. Probably most similar to Night of the Dogmen (I think that was the name of the starter in Funnel World). They were villagers fending off the undead in their village inn. Managing the number of characters became rough (maybe 4 was too many) and I admittedly probably pulled too many punches but when it came to managing characters, players were bouncing all over the place and it became easy to forget actions of other characters. I feel like in DCC, grouping initiative around a player helps organize things better (all characters go on the same initiative) but here you don‚Äôt have the same management or organization and with so many characters it feels like a continual jump from one character to the next. I tried then doing it by player (all 4 when you have the spotlight) but it then felt like an insanely long time to resolve character actions because we‚Äôre using PbtA, so instead of pass-fail ‚Äúyou die‚Äù pacing, you have ‚Äúpartial success‚Äù with more nuanced results that often take longer to resolve and don‚Äôt end up ‚Äúclearing house‚Äù. They split the party as well which really complicated things. I feel like having a dungeon to literally funnel characters through rather than a location survival sort of scenario probably also helps focus it a bit more.</p>
<p>My reflection here is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be merciless.</li>
<li>More rolls that impact a player‚Äôs group of characters that makes them use the lowest skill and/or Get Lucky Rolls.</li>
<li>Online play really takes some adjusting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just curious how other people do it. What their experiences have been.</p>

          <p>Those are all great observations and suggestions. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve run a DCC funnel that I forgot about the initiative rule. I‚Äôve been running funnels with 2 villagers per player because more than that has felt too confusing just as you describe, so I might just set the limit at 2 in the rules. Alternatively, I could just add a rule that says when a player says what they do, they do so for each of their villager PCs.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre curious about how I personally run a Freebooters funnel, you can see a few sessions starting <a href="https://youtu.be/iFEeQ3N4Woo" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, covering the funnel portion of my current online campaign. Looking back at this now I feel like I could have done a better job of following your suggestion to ‚Äúbe merciless!‚Äù</p>

          <p>On first blush I this this is great. I look forward to having a chance to test it in play, but there‚Äôs nothing here that really sticks out to me as worrisome. I like that it a.) puts Set Out back in to the traditional move structure, b.) gives Judges more latitude on what kind of incident takes place, and c.) the Incident table seems to make a lot of sense in terms of what you‚Äôre likely to come up against in each setting. You could also break out encounter tables from there ‚Äì incidents for various climates or locations, etc. and just follow the same format. I think I like this a lot!</p>

          <p>Comments on Pass the Night. Note, I haven‚Äôt been tracking this move in the past, so not sure what iterations have come before. But I had some thoughts.</p>
<p>First off, not clear who should roll this move. Does each player roll? Does each player roll during their watch? I think maybe it should be stated that if you roll +Safety, that is a roll that applies to the entire party, and the party should select someone to roll. Therefore, that applies to the Set Off and Pass the Night. In fact, you could adjust the move a bit to say ‚Äú<strong>Pass the Night</strong> When the party <em>settles into sleep</em>, take note of the watch order, and someone in the party rolls +safety. Say why they are the one rolling.‚Äù</p>
<p>Second - seems like it‚Äôs pretty tough to get a good night‚Äôs sleep, even when you are in a safe area. I mean, even while in Safe terrain, they will only get restful night of sleep every ~59% of rolls. And in dangerous terrain, they‚Äôll get restful sleep only 16.7% of the time. So that means out of 10 nights of travel, they will only regain HP on average 1-2 nights (assuming they have food the night before). And will have accumulated 8-9 points of negatives to their abilities. Is that what was intended?</p>
<p>I guess this encourages the players to do things that increase their <em>safety</em> (stay quiet, don‚Äôt light fires, etc). If that‚Äôs the intent, perhaps call it out.</p>
<p>Third - I can see Pass the Night being a pick-list</p>
<p>10+ Gain a restful night of sleep and each player picks 2<br>
7-9 Gain a restful night of sleep and each player picks pick 1</p>
<ul>
<li>You gain back your 1+CON HP (up to your max)</li>
<li>You gain back 2 ability points (up to your max)</li>
<li>You gain back 1 Luck point (up to your max)</li>
<li>You have an interesting dream (describe it). The Judge tells you if it‚Äôs relevant to your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>6- Judge makes a move (implicit in moves, probably don‚Äôt need to call this out).</p>
<p>The reason I allowed the 6- to be open, is that Creature could be one option; but with all the other possible GM moves, maybe the GM would rather do something else.</p>
<p>Finally - I feel like the 9 result is a move in and of itself. Something like:<br>
<strong>Bolster their Spirits</strong>. When you <em>offer a song, story, exhortation, or words of wisdom</em> preparing to <strong>Pass the Night</strong> roll +WIS or +CHA (the Judge will tell you which). Tell your story.<br>
On a 10+ each party member gains 1 additional HP tomorrow morning.<br>
On a 7-9, each party member gains 1 additional HP if they get restful sleep<br>
Only one Bolster the Spirits can be tried each evening.</p>

          <p>I really like Pass the Night, generally. We‚Äôve never found it to be too harsh, though we did very early on tweak how much HP you get back because our dwarf thief wasn‚Äôt happen with only ever regaining 1. We basically switched back to the Dungeon World rules there, though I think I might have nerfed it a little. At this point I don‚Äôt really remember, and I don‚Äôt have my move sheet in front of me. But I like how Pass the Night is structured, and we‚Äôve never found there to be an issue of too much ability damage stacking up. For <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/chrisshorb">@chrisshorb</a>  I would say remember that on 7-9 there‚Äôs no reason that everyone doesn‚Äôt get a good night‚Äôs sleep‚Äìfor the 9 result, it‚Äôs only if someone chooses offer a song, etc meaning it‚Äôs ultimately in the player‚Äôs hands to decide whether they‚Äôd like to suffer a night of poor sleep but granting everyone else +1 Forward. And on 7/8, it really is going to depend on what kind of incident takes place. I would probably have whoever is on watch at the time roll Stay Sharp and then go from there.* Depending on the incident, and how it‚Äôs resolved, it‚Äôs not necessarily going to end with restless sleep for everyone in the party. There‚Äôs a likelihood that it will, yes, but I think it‚Äôs a fun opportunity to play to find out what happens. Also I would just say that ability damage really isn‚Äôt that awful to recover from generally speaking. In all, I think the move fits well with the hardscrabble nature of the game. However I do recognize that allowing my players to gain back more HP from a restful night‚Äôs sleep could be a factor in why we don‚Äôt have as many problems as Chris foresees.</p>
<p>On that note, I do think that <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a> could take another look at how much HP you do get back. I think a middle ground between the current rules and what we‚Äôre doing makes sense. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what that looks like though ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>*Stay Sharp is a move that I don‚Äôt particularly like very much, for reasons discussed here and in the old G+ community: it‚Äôs passive, more akin to an old school save than a traditional PbtA move which is triggered by the PC making an action. There‚Äôs no player autonomy there at all, really. I like the results, but I don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs a passive/reactive trigger. But I don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs any easy fix for that. I know I‚Äôve talked about not liking the other ‚Äúpassive/reactive‚Äù moves but I do understand why they exist. The old-school saving throw is pretty integral to the feel of D&amp;D, and I can see a lot of tables liking those moves even as they don‚Äôt encourage the player agency of more active moves. Typically in my home game I just present the situation to whoever is on watch (I roll a d4 and pick whichever PC that lines up with in the watch order they provided) and ask what they do, which generally results in one of the other moves triggering.</p>
