<p>One of the benefits of creating bonds right at the beginning is it can signal to your players - especially ones that haven‚Äôt played a game like FotF or PbtA at all before - that they can declare something, AND IT‚ÄôS TRUE in the fiction of the game.

<p>Mechanically, Bonds aren‚Äôt all that critical (which is why I‚Äôd let them slide in a one shot); but what Bond creation says about the game at the start is really important.</p>

          <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a>, yesterday we had the issue of having to draw the HP for a follower. FotF 1E has the Perilous Wilds rules, which have a nice procedure for drawing follower stats, but 2E has nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>The booklets in 2E seem to suggest that the monster creation guide be used for all NPCs. It seems a bit weird, though, as there is no clear way of making choices on the ‚Äúnumber appearing‚Äù column for a follower or even for a random NPC. Selecting 1 on the ‚Äúnumber appearing‚Äù column seems to result in HP numbers that feel way too high for a follower or in general for a human character. In case the follower then becomes a PC, these HP would need to be re-rolled according to a class. It all feels wonky to me, or maybe I haven‚Äôt understood something.</p>
<p>What would be the suggested procedure? I feel that the 2E booklets don‚Äôt make it very clear.</p>

<p>I noticed a typo; you spelled ‚ÄúHalfling‚Äù as ‚ÄúHalfing‚Äù in the data sheet. This causes some errors.</p>

          <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/froggy">@Froggy</a> ‚Äì  It‚Äôs still in very rough draft form, but the current NPC generation procedure is outlined in the <em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ate088a48ucz4ld/FotF2e - 02 Settlements %26 Citizens (3-6-2019).pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">Settlements &amp; Citizens</a></em> book. There is no step for HP at present, though, so I just use the creature guidelines for a <em>medium</em>-sized <em>group</em> creature unless the NPC is a lone wolf type. So for example:</p>
<p>Halfling peasant (<em>small</em>, <em>group</em>, ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù): 3 x .75 = 2 HP.<br>
Dwarf peasant (<em>small</em>, <em>group</em>, ‚Äútough‚Äù): 3 x 1 = 3 HP.<br>
Human peasant  (<em>medium</em>, <em>group</em>, ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù): 6 HP x.75 = 5 HP.<br>
Human nomad (<em>medium</em>, <em>group</em>, ‚Äútough‚Äù): 6 HP x 1 = 6 HP.<br>
Human ranger (<em>medium</em>, <em>solitary</em>, ‚Äúwarrior‚Äù): 8 HP x 1.5 = 12 HP.<br>
Human bandit leader (<em>medium</em>, <em>group</em>, <em>leader</em>): 6 HP x 2 = 12 HP.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm using the <em>group</em> tag here when a given NPC spend most of their time in  a community.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been over a year since I made a pass at the NPC stuff, and what‚Äôs there has been placeholder, obviously not reconciled with the creature rules (or transitioning to full freebooter status, as you note). Right now I am finishing a draft of the region generation chapter, and then I will make a pass at the NPC rules with the goal of making everything mesh better.</p>
<p>Developing these rules has become a process of refining one area, seeing how it works in play, then reconciling it and making it consistent with other areas, which often means editing those areas as well. It‚Äôs not the most efficient approach, because I‚Äôm driven more by intuition and the way things feel in play, but I‚Äôll get there eventually. Thanks for your patience!</p>

<p>This sounds quite reasonable. My suggestion would be to clarify in the game text how to apply the number appearing tags to human NPCs.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no problem at all. We knew coming in that the game is in alpha, I‚Äôm glad to have you here clarifying stuff, and I hope this helps you figure out how you want the game to be.</p>

          <p>Played Leget Manor again today with my sons.</p>
<p>We spent a bunch of time going through the resources that the village provides and the boys decided what to take and what to leave behind. They emptied out the dung pushcart. I said it could carry 12 weight but cost the user 1/3 of whatever weight is in it. And that it has the tag <em>bulky</em>. Then we also went through ‚Äúwhat is the point of having a shoulder bag‚Äù question. There‚Äôs no mechanical concept of ‚Äúcarrying points‚Äù; but we talked it through and I identified that the herbalist who is also carrying some rations and a jug of ale probably isn‚Äôt carrying all of that in their hands. I did say for their ‚Äútools of the trade‚Äù as well as other things that those things probably had some sort of sling or holster for carrying them hands free.</p>
<p>One question <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a> we had was what happens when you get to 0 in an ability score? I said you would then trigger the ‚ÄúShuffle Off‚Äù move; but wasn‚Äôt sure.</p>

          <p>Cool, thanks for that table. Is it in the Funnel rules? Or the main rules?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs further thoughts on our session yesterday. BTW, <strong>SPOILERS</strong> for <em>Leget Manor</em> below, so proceed with that in mind.</p>
<p>After session 0 last time, and 45 minutes this time doling out the various items the village has provided to the PCs.  The characters finally start off. They immediately head towards the ‚Äúback door‚Äù to the manor via the Mire. Along the way, they encounter a swarm of Bloodbirds (a cross between a mosquito and a hummingbird). And because they are 0 level, they start dropping like flies (the PCs). They are smart, some of the still standing ones light some torches and use those to fend off the nasties. But a lot of Constitution burning was done; and curling into fetal positions‚Ä¶</p>
<p>They then enter a cave that has slime and a profusion of crawling insects‚Ä¶ They come to finally to the underground catacombs beneath the manor. There‚Äôs a T-intersection. To the left gives many of them an uneasy feeling, the right leads to a giant beetle nest. So they go right. Because my sons have mostly played D&amp;D recently (they played in my DW campaign 3-4 years ago), they charge in ready for a fight. And very quickly their front 2 characters drop to 0 HP. Again, with smart torch usage and some dragging of bodies, they are able to get their comrades free.</p>
<p>I decided to not have the beetles give chase. And we ended session there.</p>
<p>As always, with PbtA, the moves snowballed. However, I pulled back there at the end and decided to just let the guys get out of the beetle room even though I could have used a GM move and split the party or used up some resources (ok, they had to use up a torch, so that‚Äôs something). But I‚Äôm wondering - maybe I should have continued to lean into the snowball?</p>
<p>One thing I‚Äôm realizing, as this is a funnel, and they PCs get XP when they witness the death of one of their party; maybe I need to lean in more and start killing off PCs. My sons are already pretty attached to a couple of their characters.</p>
<p>Which leads my second observation - maybe I should have not spent so much time getting everything set up - because the PCs will die‚Ä¶ Or maybe that‚Äôs part of the play experience of a funnel - you are invested in the PC and when they die, you get that little soupcon of ‚Äúugh‚Äù.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have just provided the players pre-gen characters so they had almost NO investment in the PCs. Part of the Funnel experience that I‚Äôve found fun is how your character‚Äôs die. It‚Äôs less fun if I‚Äôm invested in them‚Ä¶ I may have hopes for one or the other to live; but I haven‚Äôt spent any time to create them.</p>
<p>So some thoughts for <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a></p>
<ol>
<li>I wonder if perhaps it can be more strongly noted in <em>The Funnel</em> that a very common option for a funnel is for the Judge to create the characters in advance for the players.</li>
<li>Leget Manor is a big adventure (60+ encounters). It‚Äôs going to take them probably 5+ sessions to solve this thing if they are going to ‚Äúclear it‚Äù. That‚Äôs probably going to get them to around 15-20xp each. I‚Äôm trying to think through exactly how to handle leveling and the ‚ÄúLive to Tell the Tale‚Äù move. Most likely, I‚Äôm going to let them level as far as their XP will take them whenever they get back to town the first time.</li>
<li>I probably should have followed the advice in the adventure for a ‚Äú1 session‚Äù adventure and just moved the PCs to the courtyard and encounter 1 of the Manor. Instead, once they finished doling out the village resources, I said ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù It was wide open, so they had a bunch of choices (one of my players said - ‚Äúwe head out of town with all this sweet booty they just gave us‚Äù <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">)  They felt like the poisoned water was the key element that needed addressing; so they went to the Mire to investigate. I let them very quickly find the cave ‚ÄúExit to the Mire‚Äù - especially as it afforded them some ‚Äúsafety‚Äù from the Bloodbirds. Also it got them into the Manor and the meat of the adventure.</li>
</ol>
<p>HOWEVER the concern I could see is they could very quickly then solve the Idol of the Frog God room; and fundamentally end part of the adventure (Lintrude‚Äôs illness, villager‚Äôs dying crops). What I‚Äôm going to do then in this case is have Scievedevang start to raid the town; and the PCs are required to head back to the Manor (maybe as 1st level adventurers) and either make a deal with Scievedevang (which will be hard if Grenwar-Nee isn‚Äôt around anymore) or kill him somehow. Even though in the book it says Scievedevang will want to travel the earth and do bad things, it does say he‚Äôll start with the village. So I think it‚Äôs within what Jason wrote to have him stay around for a bit. I‚Äôll also probably add some new undead - but this time they are people the characters recognize‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I guess another approach would be to move the Frog God Idol somewhere else. But I think I‚Äôll try to play the adventure as written so far. And we‚Äôll see how it all works out.</p>

<p>This is part of my advocacy to remove non-random aspects from character creation. Not only does it allow everyone to get to the meat of the adventure, but it allows the player to more quickly roll up a new character if necessary. You end up discovering and developing your characters, and their relationships, through play.</p>

          <p>I haven‚Äôt actually had the chance to run Freebooters yet, but my experience running DCC RPG funnels is extensive. Since all the rolling was random for 0-level characters (aside from name and alignment), I just printed off a stack of pre-made characters using a simple character generator. If someone needed another one, they just pull from the stack at random. If someone wants to roll their own, however, it doesn‚Äôt take too long and they‚Äôll be back in the game in no time.</p>

<p>Cool, thanks for that table. Is it in the Funnel rules? Or the main rules?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Basic Rules book, near the end.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>As always, with PbtA, the moves snowballed. However, I pulled back there at the end and decided to just let the guys get out of the beetle room even though I could have used a GM move and split the party or used up some resources (ok, they had to use up a torch, so that‚Äôs something). But I‚Äôm wondering - maybe I should have continued to lean into the snowball?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think that‚Äôs a table-by-table call, and certainly in your first run through of the system with your boys I think making more soft moves than hard ones is the safe way to keep people engaged. The main thing I strive for is to make sure the players are aware of the stakes at any given time, so the hard moves feel fair. ‚ÄúIf you go any further into these twisty tunnels, I just want to make it clear there‚Äôs a real risk you might get lost.‚Äù That kind of thing.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Which leads my second observation - maybe I should have not spent so much time getting everything set up - because the PCs will die‚Ä¶ Or maybe that‚Äôs part of the play experience of a funnel - you are invested in the PC and when they die, you get that little soupcon of ‚Äúugh‚Äù.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have just provided the players pre-gen characters so they had almost NO investment in the PCs. Part of the Funnel experience that I‚Äôve found fun is how your character‚Äôs die. It‚Äôs less fun if I‚Äôm invested in them‚Ä¶ I may have hopes for one or the other to live; but I haven‚Äôt spent any time to create them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The people I play with on a regular basis take particular pleasure in getting attached to their villagers; losing one is a poignant but enjoyable part of the game for them. I appreciate that our play culture may be an outlier, though, and could see paring down the villagers creation process more as <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasonabdin">@jasonabdin</a> suggests.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>So some thoughts for <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a></p>
<ol>
<li>I wonder if perhaps it can be more strongly noted in <em>The Funnel</em> that a very common option for a funnel is for the Judge to create the characters in advance for the players.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I put a high value on people rolling up their own characters, because even if it‚Äôs 90% random, it still feels like ‚Äúyours.‚Äù This is a pretty big part of the Freebooters ‚Äúethos‚Äù (for lack of a better word), but I can certainly add in a suggestion along those lines.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Leget Manor is a big adventure (60+ encounters). It‚Äôs going to take them probably 5+ sessions to solve this thing if they are going to ‚Äúclear it‚Äù. That‚Äôs probably going to get them to around 15-20xp each. I‚Äôm trying to think through exactly how to handle leveling and the ‚ÄúLive to Tell the Tale‚Äù move. Most likely, I‚Äôm going to let them level as far as their XP will take them whenever they get back to town the first time.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, it ended up being pretty big, and very much not a traditional funnel in that sense. I think returning to town for supplies, replacement villagers, and to level up is a great idea and one I should incorporate into the text.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>I probably should have followed the advice in the adventure for a ‚Äú1 session‚Äù adventure and just moved the PCs to the courtyard and encounter 1 of the Manor. Instead, once they finished doling out the village resources, I said ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù It was wide open, so they had a bunch of choices (one of my players said - ‚Äúwe head out of town with all this sweet booty they just gave us‚Äù <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">) They felt like the poisoned water was the key element that needed addressing; so they went to the Mire to investigate. I let them very quickly find the cave ‚ÄúExit to the Mire‚Äù - especially as it afforded them some ‚Äúsafety‚Äù from the Bloodbirds. Also it got them into the Manor and the meat of the adventure.</li>
</ol>
<p>HOWEVER the concern I could see is they could very quickly then solve the Idol of the Frog God room; and fundamentally end part of the adventure (Lintrude‚Äôs illness, villager‚Äôs dying crops). What I‚Äôm going to do then in this case is have Scievedevang start to raid the town; and the PCs are required to head back to the Manor (maybe as 1st level adventurers) and either make a deal with Scievedevang (which will be hard if Grenwar-Nee isn‚Äôt around anymore) or kill him somehow. Even though in the book it says Scievedevang will want to travel the earth and do bad things, it does say he‚Äôll start with the village. So I think it‚Äôs within what Jason wrote to have him stay around for a bit. I‚Äôll also probably add some new undead - but this time they are people the characters recognize‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I guess another approach would be to move the Frog God Idol somewhere else. But I think I‚Äôll try to play the adventure as written so far. And we‚Äôll see how it all works out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I love that they took the back door approach, and if they succeed in destroying the idol, that‚Äôs great, because then they‚Äôve freed the lich and will have to deal with him. I will rewrite the description of Sciedevang‚Äôs plans, because in my head the village was the first order of business for him.</p>
<p>Thanks for the report, <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/chrisshorb">@chrisshorb</a>!</p>

          <p>The Overland &amp; Underworld content looks good. I like the inclusion of the section on Freeform vs. Hex Map; especially, since my campaign kind of fell in to a hex map by virtue of my tinkering with Hex Kit to create a map for the region we created at the beginning. I kind of modified it to be 1 leg of travel to move through a hex and adding additional legs for factors like terrain and weather to avoid getting in to the more precise miles counting.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to dig in to creating an almanac for the region they‚Äôve been exploring when I get a chance because when I saw the update, I realized it was what I have sorely needed as a tool for organizing my region.</p>
