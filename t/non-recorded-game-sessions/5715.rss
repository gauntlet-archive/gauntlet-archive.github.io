    <title>Non-recorded game sessions</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/non-recorded-game-sessions/5715</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve been lurking here and looking over the announcements of new games, and I see that most sessions include a notice that the organizer would like to record the session. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever be comfortable with a recorded game, though, so I am hesitant to RSVP as I don&#39;t want to disappoint people whose preferences run the other way.

Would people in fact be disappointed if they consistently couldn&#39;t record their game sessions?  If so, I&#39;d like to encourage an increase in non-recorded games. Thanks!</description>

              <p>The Code of Conduct is very clear, if somebody does not want to be recorded, you may not do so, regardless of whether you’re planning on posting it, or only sharing it with the designer or whatever. Some people don’t like to be recorded for any reason, and the Code of Conduct (as well as basic human decency) requires that a GM respect that.  To be clear, I don’t think anybody here has suggested otherwise. That said, I do worry about putting pressure on people who don’t want to be recorded, which can happen even with the best of intentions.  “Is everybody ok with being recorded?”. “I’d rather you didn’t”. “It’s just going to be for my files as the designer…” Can put somebody in an uncomfortable position and make it feel like you’re not taking no for an answer. Being very clear about recording in your description helps, but I think taking a person’s no at face value is important.</p>
<p>I confess that I am not always as sensitive about this as I should be, and I’m working on it.</p>

              <p>Right! It’s been really helpful to me to listen to you run Checkpoint Midnight, Alun. But if one of the players had requested the recordings not be posted publicly, I bet you could have worked something out where you shared the recordings only with me, the designer.</p>

              <p>The only caveat I’d offer is that if it’s a game in development then each recording is of tremendous value as part of the development process.  That needn’t involve publishing but it occurs to me that making that development need clearer in some of the sessions I put in the calendar would be sensible.</p>
<p>Even in those circumstance there’s no need to announce your IRL name or even have the camera on if anonymity is the desired outcome.</p>

              <p>And if you sign up, feel free to have that convo with the GM ahead of time. Then they don’t have to ask about that at the start of session, it’s already arranged.</p>
<p>As Darren says, you should never feel bad about saying you don’t want a session recorded. It’s happened before and it will happen again.</p>
