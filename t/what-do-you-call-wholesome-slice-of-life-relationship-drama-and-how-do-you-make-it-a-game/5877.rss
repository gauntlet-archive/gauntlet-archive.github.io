    <description>A few weeks back I got caught up on the webcomic [Questionable Content](https://questionablecontent.net/) and I was struck by how, well, wholesome it is, using the word in the way that was fashionable a couple of years ago.

The characters - and it has a huge cast, built over many years - are nearly universally good people. Even the ones who started out as selfish or intentionally disruptive have mellowed out or realised they have issues they need to work on. The drama comes almost entirely from the characters&#39; internal conflicts: Someone is attracted to someone else and don&#39;t know if they feel the same way, someone has an issue that prevents them from enjoying their life and they&#39;re trying to work through it, someone is feeling insecure about something and their friends help them try to get over it.

It&#39;s all very... benign, would be a word for it, I guess. Sure, there are one-off characters who are jerks, but they&#39;re less malicious than clueless or superficial.

Now this may be a genre that&#39;s huge and I&#39;ve just never come across it before, but it feels very refreshing to me. I guess it&#39;s the relationship drama counterpart to pastoral fantasy, kind of? Pastoral drama?

Anyway, I&#39;m trying to figure out a way to turn it into a game that has stakes and such, because while I love the high drama of Pasiones or other drama-focused games I could use some purely positive relationship gaming as well.

Any thoughts?</description>

              <p><a href="https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/our-mundane-supernatural-life/" rel="nofollow noopener">Our Mundane Supernatural Life</a> by Storybrewers really captured slice of life relationship drama to me, but it’s a two-player game. It makes use of timed scenes, which I think for me caught the idea of mundane things not necessarily always being resolved. I wonder if there is a way to do this same thing with more players.</p>
<p>Good Society (also by Storybrewers) generates a lot of relationship drama - I wonder if character desires could be hacked to focus more on slice of life (and possibly move it a little further from its genre-heavy/historical drama background).</p>
<p>I’m also thinking about <a class="mention" href="/u/bethany_h">@Bethany_H</a>’s <a href="https://bethanyharvey.itch.io/unincorporated" rel="nofollow noopener">Unincorporated</a> which has A plot and B plots and lets you determine the tones and stakes of the story you tell! And depending on how you set up your town and relationships, I feel like you could have something cozy and wholesome.</p>
<p>Ooh and maybe <a href="https://sellmanatlas.itch.io/heaven-has-no-taste" rel="nofollow noopener">Heaven Has No Taste and Other True Statements</a>, which has the line: “Queer slice of life and immortal romance” and prompts scenes based on courtship, feelings, community, and past hurts.</p>
<p>I think a good thing in a game like this would be to get everyone on the same page and have a conversation about the type of story you’d like to create and the type of stakes that you would like to see.</p>

              <p>I’m assuming that <strong>Golden Sky Stories</strong> are following kishotenketsu, which is an Easter Asian narrative structure that may have, but doesn’t have to resolve around, conflict. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Memories of Murder</a> is an example, where the police officer doesn’t solve the crime (conflict!), but we get instead to follow and get an insight in the officer’s thoughts and emotions. It presents you with a perspective, and possibly makes you think. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Man from Earth</a> is another brilliant example - that movie brought me hours of contemplation.</p>
<p>I based <a href="https://www.urverkspel.com/vara-spel/oevriga-projekt" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Imagine</a> on kishotenketsu when I wanted to create a game without conflicts. It’s not what you’re after because Imagine is a storytelling game more than a roleplaying game - people narrate together without playing any roles.</p>
<p>I know that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timfire/the-mountain-witch-samurai-blood-opera-in-mythical" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Mountain Witch</a> is based upon kishoteketsu as well, but the witch killing samurais are having their own goals as well. I never read or played it myself, sadly.</p>
<p>Something I really liked the basic idea in <strong>Bad Family</strong>—which is basically Simpsons/Family Guy the RPG—is that each character take on an everyday task, and continues to fail with that until the game tell you that you can succeed (simply put). Like, taking out the trash, helping your sister with her homework, or writing a letter. There will always be things that hinders you from completing the task.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest that you run <a href="http://froudounich.free.fr/PDF/PSYCHODRAME-FINAL01.pdf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Psychodrame</a> (pdf) through google translate. It’s based around a kicker that starts something off, like “The father returns after years of absence to his family”, where the other characters are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fiction)" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">foils</a> of each other. If one is a cop, another is a pot smoking anarchist. But it should be played in a slow way. A scene could be the dad is sitting sighing, watching a photograph. It didn’t sound fun to me, but it connected to me in a way no other game have done.</p>
<p>The social resolution system is based off <strong>Dogs in the Vineyard</strong>, but uses hidden cards (instead of open dice) and you draw cards from your stats - moods and emotions - which guides how the conversation/argument is played out. More roleplaying game designers should check out that system, actually.</p>
<p>If you get around to GothCon, LinCon or NordCon in Sweden, you can probably find people willing to play it in the indie room.</p>

Everything else is just ways of getting XP for your quests, and Issues that track something specific your character is dealing with.</p>
<p>I don’t play with the Miraculous arcs, because I think they are a bit complex and prescriptive, and get in the way of the beauty of the setting.</p>

              <p>Yeah, Chuubo’s Marvelous Wish-granting Engine was pretty much built for this, one of the main modes of play is just called ‘pastoral’ . It’s pretty much exactly what you’re talking about, generally decent people experiencing life together, in a setting filled with nice people with low-key supernatural elements (Fortitude, the area of the setting designed for Pastoral play, is a lovely place full of subtle detail).</p>
<p>Play is heavily based around quest cards, which are small stories or bits of story. You get XP for playing your character and hitting broad conditions set out on the card, when you have enough XP invested in it you can finish the quest and complete that bit of story. Quests can be more dramatic or magical (like investigating something supernatural), or subtle and low-key (like fixing up a house).</p>

<p>There are a few games that hit a similar tone, where everyone is a decent person trying their best. Golden Sky Stories, Space Post, A Cozy Den, and The Queen of Cups all live in that sort of space. Or I could see running something like that in a low-stakes version of Dramasystem. But there definitely is room for more wholesome slice of life games of this sort.</p>

              <p>Regardless of the stakes being slaying a dragon or trying to survive your first day of college, the actual drama of a story is “will this character succeed despite what’s in their way?” What’s “in their way” could be themselves (morals, flaws, beliefs) or it could be external (enemies, lack of resources, distance, danger, etc).</p>
<p>The job of the game designer is to create a system that provides metrics for character and challenges keyed to what kind of story you want to tell. DnD has stats for monsters, weapons, and magic. Shadowrun has stats for guns, robots, and hacking. A theoretical relationship drama game would have stats for character beliefs, flaws, relationships, and perhaps “curios”. I’m thinking of something like Lady Blackbird where a character would have vague backstory briefs like “lost an important friend” that the player can expand upon and calcify into something new when their character solidifies or radically changes and aspect of themselves.</p>
<p>Conflict resolution (or game resource management) will need to be keyed to the kind of stakes involved in the story. You need some way to collapse the possibility space of big events in the story (will this character rush to stop their love at the airport or decide to find a new love?) What resolution system you use is up to personal preference.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ve heard of multiple games that deliver what you’re looking for but I can’t remember any specific names. I know there’s one about reproducing a sitcom. There’s a couple that do harlequin romance. There’s one for simulating wrestling.</p>

              <p>A few weeks back I got caught up on the webcomic <a href="https://questionablecontent.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Questionable Content</a> and I was struck by how, well, wholesome it is, using the word in the way that was fashionable a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>The characters - and it has a huge cast, built over many years - are nearly universally good people. Even the ones who started out as selfish or intentionally disruptive have mellowed out or realised they have issues they need to work on. The drama comes almost entirely from the characters’ internal conflicts: Someone is attracted to someone else and don’t know if they feel the same way, someone has an issue that prevents them from enjoying their life and they’re trying to work through it, someone is feeling insecure about something and their friends help them try to get over it.</p>
<p>It’s all very… benign, would be a word for it, I guess. Sure, there are one-off characters who are jerks, but they’re less malicious than clueless or superficial.</p>
<p>Now this may be a genre that’s huge and I’ve just never come across it before, but it feels very refreshing to me. I guess it’s the relationship drama counterpart to pastoral fantasy, kind of? Pastoral drama?</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m trying to figure out a way to turn it into a game that has stakes and such, because while I love the high drama of Pasiones or other drama-focused games I could use some purely positive relationship gaming as well.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
