<p>This time around there are 153 ZineQuest projects, 84 of those a tabletop roleplaying games and gamebooks. There are 48 „normal“ projects as well (I put those in another article).</p>
<p>These are way to many games, to give each one a shout-out. Thus I’ll be sticking to those, which I backed or marked for later considerations.<br>
Thus I will start with <b>Tension</b>. It focuses on the tensions between a detective and a criminal, not unlike shows like „Hannibal“. As I am a fan of the series, I decided to back the project. The game <b>Denial &amp; Yearning: A Trashy Lesbian Romance Novel Game</b> offers quite exactly what the titles describes. An additional note I would add, is that it is one of the „two player“ roleplaying games, that you’ll be playing with one other person. I backed <b>Once Upon a Time in New Centauri</b>, based on its optics and theme, yet the project surprisingly ended between publishing my German edition, and this one. Thus, it only gets an honorably mention. The sourcematerial <b>The Journal of Fantastic Linguistics</b> offers a look at crypto linguistic (how „made up“ languages work). I am quite fascinated by languages in general, and thus jumped in.<br>
Then there is <b>Natalia’s Guide to Necromancy</b>, that introduces more necromancy and vampires into D&amp;D 5E. The <b>Vampire Cruise</b> OSR adventure, sport my favorite creature as well, alas, only as antagonists. These, and many, many more projects, you’ll find in this article.</p>
