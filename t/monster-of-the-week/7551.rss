    <description>**Monster of the Week**

Most people don’t believe in monsters, but you know the truth. They’re real, and it’s your task to bring them down. Inspired by media such as Buffy, Supernatural, The X-Files, and Fringe, create a team of bad-ass Hunters and face the horrors that stalk the land.

In this five-session run we’ll play one or more of the scenarios from the Tome of Mysteries expansion.

NOTE: This is my first true outing with PBTA, so please only sign up if you’re ready to deal with a facilitator finding his feet. Cheers.

CONTENT WARNING: Violence, horror, the supernatural, possibly body horror, romance.

SESSIONS: 5

DURATION: 3 hours.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Three players in addition to the facilitator. 

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy, Stars &amp; Wishes. The game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

VENUE/TECH: Zoom Video, Roll20 Character Sheets. Expect an email one week before the first session with the Roll20 link, and another shortly before the session.

BREAKS: Two 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

RECORDING: Sessions will be recorded, but would only be posted with full enthusiastic player consent.  Currently the plan is to record only for the facilitator’s reference.

PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: None – rules will be taught in play.
