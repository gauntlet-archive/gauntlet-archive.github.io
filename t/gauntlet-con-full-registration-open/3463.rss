    <description>Now anyone, Patreon backer or no, can [sign up for Gauntlet Con 2019](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-con-2019-registration.html)!

**Back us on Patreon:** If you choose to back us on [Patreon at $2+ or higher](https://www.patreon.com/gauntlet/) (or did so in the past week), you can expedite getting confirmed as an attendee by:

1. First, logging in to our [RSVP site](https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/) with your Google ID.
2. Second, leaving a comment on this [Patron post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/gauntlet-con-30290293).

**Back with PayPal:** for just a one-time $10 (and ONLY $10!), you can join us. You&#39;ll get an email from us after you buy your admission with directions on next steps. However, if you go ahead and log in to our [RSVP site](https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/) with your Google ID, you&#39;ll be ready to go even faster once that email comes.

**But aren&#39;t all the games full??** No! We&#39;ve still got over 90 sessions that still have openings. You can check out this [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/Arr_Roo/status/1179167069092356098) for some ideas and suggestions, but they only barely crack the surface.</description>
