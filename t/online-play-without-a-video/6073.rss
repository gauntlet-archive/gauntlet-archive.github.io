    <title>Online play without a video</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/online-play-without-a-video/6073</link>
    <description>Hello,
I am wondering what is the etiquette regarding online play without a webcam. 

My connection speed is slow (2M up and 0,5 down on average) and every time I played on Skype and Zoom, I inflicted embarrassing lags on the other players. I recently read that things *can* go smoother if I just shut down my video camera. 
But then : is it acceptable ?</description>

              <p>Agreed with Rob: While I prefer it when I can see everyone, bandwidth can get scarce. When that happens, it’s best to shut off your webcam.</p>

              <p>As a question of Gauntlet etiquette, though, it is perfectly fine to play without using a webcam. There are more than a few regular players who play without video and use voice only!</p>

              <p>I do prefer playing on video without a focus on any map or vtt BUT lag can kill a session entirely.  I consider this fine for days with the internet is responding slowly but I’d prefer not to play if that was an all the time thing.  Depending on the game, I would prefer to dump the vtt first though.</p>
