&gt; For the first 48 hours, please only sign up if you are in the UK/EU

&gt; Note: The event day has been changed from Thursday at 2 p.m. Central time/GMT -5 to Friday at 2 p.m./GMT -5.

Crime lord Hugo Díaz Ventura has been taken into custody, but even as his gang disintegrated before his eyes due to the heroic actions of his twin, known (to most) only as The Fox, a third severed head, drained of blood, was found on another sidewalk in the usually sleepy coastal town called Ciudad Soñando. The mysteries remain - why are the heads drained of blood? And where are the bodies? Why haven’t they turned up yet?

Yet somehow, the nightlife continues, even with a serial killer dubbed El Sangrador - who has already claimed the lives of professional surfers Kevin Brewster and Jason Collins and rising star Esteban Ruiz - stalking the darkness. Even worse, Ventura’s former lieutenants are fighting to claim parts of his empire for themselves, and the echo of gunfire through the streets is becoming a sadly common sound. And winter storms approach, bringing bigger waves and more surfers … including a surf camp for young Black women, coming to town to spend a week surfing with legends like Martina Segovia, Monica Carlos, and Jade Tyler.

There’s an underlying tension in the neon-clad nightclubs now; the music isn’t quite as loud, people don’t order as many drinks, and they leave a little bit earlier, usually with at least one other person. There is, after all, safety in numbers. … Isn’t there?

This session will use a lengthy list of Lines and Veils to facilitate an initial baseline for player safety. Players are absolutely encouraged to add more topics to the list for their own safety. This session will also use the X-Card and Script Change as necessary to adjust the game while it’s in progress to maintain player safety. Finally, the Open Door Policy is always in effect and players may leave at any time for any length of time at any reason. This session will also adhere to The Gauntlet&#39;s Community Code of Conduct: [https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gauntlet-rpg.com%2Fcommunity-code-of-conduct.html)

We will use Streamyard for the event and, if all participants consent, it will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube.

All Access Date: 07/23/2020, 5 p.m. Central time/GMT -5

A seat is being saved for Anders Gabrielsson.
