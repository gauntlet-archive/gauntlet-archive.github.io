    <title>Final Girl: Dinoland</title>

    <description>This is a one-shot scheduled for 4 hours.

&quot;Congratulations! You&#39;ve been invited to the exclusive soft opening of DINOLAND, the hot new theme park everyone&#39;s been buzzing about! You&#39;ll get an early look at our brand-new facilities and be one of the first people to enjoy the wonder of witnessing an ancient world brought to life!

Make sure you pack your camera, because we guarantee this will be the experience of a lifetime!&quot;

Final Girl is a card-based collaborative game of messy, bloody, violent horror. It&#39;s about an entangled cast of characters that die one right after the other in the hands of the killer — in this case, dinosaurs! If you&#39;ve seen the first Jurassic Park movie, you&#39;ll know exactly what to do.
