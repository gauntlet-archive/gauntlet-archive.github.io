          <p>I present to you the <a href="https://teylen.blog/2021/03/03/crowdfunding-collection-161/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>new Crowdfunding Collection #161, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/15 and 03/03</b></a>.</p>
<p>This collection contains about 76 „normal“ projects, which is completed by 82 ZineQuest projects.<br>
As the collection spans a bit more than two weeks, some projects have ended. You’ll find the ended projects at the end of the list of English projects.</p>
<p>In regards of the ZineQuest, I would like to highlight and recommend the work by Emily McGlawn. She collected all ZineQuest projects from marginalised folks into one google document. Which offers the added information, which of these projects funded, and which didn’t.</p>
<p>I would like to start with <b>Coyote &amp; Crow</b>. The setting offer a vision of America in which the native haven’t been colonized, and places the players into a near future scifi scenario with fantasy elements. The game is build upon a d12 system and looks cool. Added that the game is actually designed by a team of native american designers, I was very likely to back it. As there is no shipment option for Germany, I might pick it up from a FLGS in the future. If you take alook at the <b>Universe Ball Anthology</b> you’ll find two scifi roleplaying games, who take a comedic approach inspired by works like „Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy“ and „Doctor Who“ among other. I like the look and recommend checking it out. Then there’s <b>Vessel</b>, which mixes scifi and fantasy. You can take a look at the alpha and beta editions of the game, and if financed, the game PDF will be available for free.<br>
I headed the more general category with <b>DIESEL</b>, as I do enjoy the artwork. The game offers a mix of cyberpunk and western, and it utillizes a d6 based system. The fantasy setting of <b>Greyplains</b>, a OSR game that aims to be enjoyable for 5E enthusiasts, offering diverse mechanics and fast combat. I got „Dark Souls vibes“ from it, and hence think it’s worth checking out. If you got kids, maybe take a look at <b>Crafty Quest Box</b>. It’s a rpg that has quite some crafting elements addressed to childrend, and looks like it is fun. Maybe you are looking for a more mature theme like modern warfare. In which case you might take interest into the second edition of the <b>Ghost Ops: Second Strike</b> game.<br>
Then there is the very small game <b>Adventure Coasters</b>, which utilizes coasters for dungeon creators, and if you like to check out a solo game, take a look at the <b>Journeys: Dungeon Descent RPG</b>.<br>
I personally backed the LARP script for <b>Just a Little Lovin‘</b>. A game set in San Francisco during the AIDS crisis. I heard only positive stuff during my attendeces on conferences, and hence jumped in. Though I am hesitant to stay in, as the shipping is kind of harsh – if you can’t pick it up. Next to that, you’ll find that <b>Make A Scene Larp Anthologies</b> offers an interesting selection of scripts, worth checking out.<br>
I did back the sourcebook <b>Victorian Mage</b> for the 20th anniversary edition of Mage: The Ascension. I am a fan of the WoD, I was genuinely surprised when I found the project, and the book looks rad. I am still pondering whether or not to back <b>Remarkable Cults &amp; Their Followers – GM Guide for Any RPG</b>. While it might be more focused on fantasy, than VtM appropriate urban fantasy, it does looks quite interesting.<br>
There are many more projects, like the <b>Gelatinous Cat Plushie</b>. You find these and more here:</p>
