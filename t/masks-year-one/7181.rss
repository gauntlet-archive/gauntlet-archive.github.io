**For the first 24 hours please only sign up if you have a) joined this year and b) haven’t yet played a regular Calendar game with me (so not including GCOG sessions).**

This is for a series of **nine** sessions of *Masks: A New Generation* with a special framework. These will happen Sundays in August/September at 10AM Eastern Time. 

Everyone will choose a superhero (or villain) from an existing property (DC, Marvel, Image, whatever). They don&#39;t have to be teen characters, they could be adults. But you will run a “Year One,” just starting out, teen version of that character. You&#39;ll select a playbook which fits with that character&#39;s archetype. You can rework and recontextualize the character&#39;s identity and background or use lots of elements of the established backstory. We&#39;d use this to build a new world and heroic mythos. Your choice of characters establishes facts about the world.

Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged. One seat is being reserved. General RSVPs Open 7/15

**Three Notes:**
* I’ll ask everyone to choose their character and playbook before the first session. We’ll negotiate about those picks in a set up email so we don’t get overlap in playbooks.
* No characters from grimdark settings or with a murderous concept (*Punisher, Kick Ass, The Boys,*  or anything like that). I reserve the right to veto picks.
* Tone will aim for *Young Justice, Young Avengers.*

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
