    <description>I received very useful best practices from @edige23 and now I am preparing for my first Gauntlet game!

Still, I have a question for experienced Gauntlet GMs! If you could give just one advice to the yourself who you were before your first game ran at Gauntlet, what would it be?</description>

              <p>I’ll share a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Perhaps more than anything else, the one statement that really made GMing snap into focus for me was <a class="mention" href="/u/edige23">@edige23</a> saying: “GMing is a combination of interviewing and meeting management.” Keep the questions coming and keep asking different people by name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two tips on safety tools from <a class="mention" href="/u/jimlikesgames">@JimLikesGames</a> (also, Jim is running a Gauntlet Facilitation Camp in June - new or prospective GMs should absolutely sign up for either his, Jammi’s, or <a class="mention" href="/u/alexi_sarge">@Alexi_Sarge</a>’s. I’m running one as well):</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Always do character introductions last, after safety tools. You want to keep players in their characters as much as possible - introducing characters, THEN doing safety tools pulls them out of their characters. Introduce and explain safety tools, THEN introducing characters is the better order.</p>
<p>Don’t read lines or veils on the recording. Explain what lines are, provide a common example (such as sexual assault), then explain what veils are (commonly, consensual sexual activity) and how they work. Reading all of the lines and veils out loud airs your players’ private business.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You will rarely, if ever, deal with someone who behaves poorly if you make a mistake. It is virtually guaranteed that you will share your virtual table with people who want to have fun, want you to have fun, and are happy to help ensure everyone is having fun, so relax. As one example, players will often help you look up relevant stats or rules, especially if you’re having a problem finding it (as Lowell did to help me out last Tuesday). People with knowledge of the game are happy to pitch in, talk about the finer/more arcane points, etc. (<a class="mention" href="/u/gerwynwalters">@GerwynWalters</a> literally spent something like three hours after a rough session of World Wide Wrestling I ran last year helping me through a few things I thought I understood and didn’t.)</li>
</ol>
<p>You will share tables with some of the kindest and most gracious people you will ever meet. If you miss calling for a roll, someone will likely ask, not as a criticism but out of a genuine desire to make sure everyone has a good time and help you succeed.</p>
<p>So basically, my advice is simple: Relax and have fun with it. Easier said than done, but still <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>

              <p>I wrote an article on how to approach an online session as a facilitator as while back: <a href="https://alles-ist-zahl.blogspot.com/2019/02/sharing-coginitive-load.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://alles-ist-zahl.blogspot.com/2019/02/sharing-coginitive-load.html</a></p>
<p>It also contains a link to a template to prepare and then guide you through the session.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t sweat it too much. People want to have a good time. They don’t mind and will likely not even realise when you diverge from “best practice” or from the structure you had prepared for yourself. If there is something important for them, they will point it out.</p>
<p>A practical tip: invite players to do scenes just between them after they are set up. Say explicitly that you will lean back for this one. It gives you a moment of relaxation and joy while possibly being in too many roles (facilitator, spotlight share eye keeping, NPCs drives,…) most of the time.</p>

<p>I find s script/checklist that runs intro/my pronouns - CATS - safety tools - player intro/pronouns - character intro settles me at the start of a session … I usually have it written down on screen when I start.  Last night I came straight from something else and didn’t have it in sight and I was all over the place.  So work out your own settling ritual and write it down.  It will become habit after a while but knowing it’s there helps me.</p>

<p>Remember that the folks on Gauntlet are Polite As F*ck, and want you to succeed, so take it easy on yourself. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=9" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

              <p>I received very useful best practices from <a class="mention" href="/u/edige23">@edige23</a> and now I am preparing for my first Gauntlet game!</p>
<p>Still, I have a question for experienced Gauntlet GMs! If you could give just one advice to the yourself who you were before your first game ran at Gauntlet, what would it be?</p>
