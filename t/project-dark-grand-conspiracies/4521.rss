It all started with a simple job.


Telburke Manor was going to be a one and done. They were holding some jewelry that was being shipped through to the Crown and a contact owed you, so you knew about it.  Lord Telburke would be at a gala that evening.


Sneak in, grab the jewels out from under the nose of the guards who would use the Lord&#39;s absence to relax and, if you&#39;re lucky, have a drink or 6.


But, what you found with the jewels.... well, you&#39;d leave better off alone if you weren&#39;t pretty sure it was going to come and bite you in the end. 


------

This will be using Project; Dark (yes, that one) to replicate the gameplay of the old Thief series of games.  You&#39;ll be casing a joint, breaking in, and keeping to the shadows to take what you hope is a small fortune with you.  This will be a linked series of jobs, with information found in each leading to the next.


There are 4 sessions that are 3.5 hours each.  Game sessions will be recorded and posted with permission from the players.


You don&#39;t have to attend all 4 sessions but you DO need  to be able to attend at least 2 in a row.


The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy will be in effect and the X-Card, Lines, and Veils will be used.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and  the X-Card, Lines, and Veils will be used.
