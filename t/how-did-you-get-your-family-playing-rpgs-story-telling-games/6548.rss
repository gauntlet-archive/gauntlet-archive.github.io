    <title>How did you get your family playing RPGs/story-telling games?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/how-did-you-get-your-family-playing-rpgs-story-telling-games/6548</link>
    <description>Hi all, I am wanting to introduce my family (age range 9-45) to collaborative story-telling. I&#39;ve trawled these and other forums for game recommendations and have compiled quite a list ranging from Honey Heist to Maze Rats to The Quiet Year.

I am not sure yet what they will like. No one is really into sci-fi or fantasy, but it&#39;s the character development and storytelling experience I am after.

Can anyone share their experience, what worked, what didn&#39;t, tips, and things to avoid?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>There’s some good and interesting advice here.</p>
<p>My 2cents: try Story Dice.</p>
<p>You can start with someone rolling up their own monologue-story. Then you go to a rule where every player rolls a character and a tool and then you GM and they share the antagonist. This didn’t grow my family into TTRPG players but it did have a similar experience while being completely lightweight and very easily approachable.</p>

Humoristic, creative, about two hours of play time, short but with some few system mastery elements. Doesn’t need more knowledge than knowing anything about fantasy.</p>

              <p>I would just play Follow with them;  It’s not “Themed” – you pick a “Quest” as part of play, which is something like “performing a heist” or “curing a disease” or whatever, so setting/fantasy/whatever is not an issue.</p>
<p>That said, there still need to be people who care about “playing make believe” and there needs to be some sort of middle ground in terms of genre – if one person wants the ‘heist’ to be Ocean’s 11, one wants it to be Harry Potter, one wants it to be National Treasure, and one wants Goodfellas, it’s still not going to be a lot of fun?</p>

              <p>Great answer here from DeReel.</p>
<p>I think the biggest challenge with doing this with a family is that you are going to have a very different level of interest and involvement from each person (as opposed to a gaming group, which has gathered with the explicit intent to engage in this particular activity).</p>
<p>Some people get really excited about roleplaying, or really invested in the characters or the adventure, and other people just don’t want to engage. So, you’ll have to be prepared for that, whether it just means to be emotionally prepared, or to have a backup plan for those who are less interested.</p>
<p>What kind of people constitute your family? Is this you and your spouse and children, or something more unusual? Any teenagers? Anyone with RPG experience? Are they competitive, shy, entertainers?</p>
<p>You could bring in someone with RPG experience to run a game for you, as well. That might change the dynamic.</p>
<p>As for game and genre, try to figure out what your family <em>is</em> into - favourite novels, films, TV shows, art projects? It would be good to start with something everyone can get excited about.</p>

              <p>Advice are cheap and not suited to every case, but here you go : if you can, first gather the more enthusiast and ask them what they want to play. Then try a super short session (15’) to see what they <strong>really</strong> meant by that. Then, let their enthusiasm rally the other ones. I have found it works better than trying to play a middle ground game that satisfies nobody. Most of the older won’t care about the game, only about the event, and the younger won’t care about the rules, only about the fluff.<br>
Also, as a facilitator, put your own fun on the side and follow <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/what-are-things-you-see-good-players-do/1679">some other advice</a>.</p>

              <p>Hi all, I am wanting to introduce my family (age range 9-45) to collaborative story-telling. I’ve trawled these and other forums for game recommendations and have compiled quite a list ranging from Honey Heist to Maze Rats to The Quiet Year.</p>
<p>I am not sure yet what they will like. No one is really into sci-fi or fantasy, but it’s the character development and storytelling experience I am after.</p>
<p>Can anyone share their experience, what worked, what didn’t, tips, and things to avoid?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
