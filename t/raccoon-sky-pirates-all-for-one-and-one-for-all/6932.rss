    <description>**Raccoon Sky Pirates: All for One and One for All**

![raccoon-cover2-square|500x500](upload://uhAeI7tXBV02zkTmkyjpjBzSqBs.png) 

*Raccoon Sky Pirates* is a GM-less story game for 3–6 players. In it, you play a crew of ring-tailed night bandits. Build your flying ship out of junk, ransack a suburban house for all its loot, fight off the Neighborhood Watch, and, with any luck, return home in one piece. The game centers around joyfully random actions and the infinite uses for trash.

You live in the junkyard. There, you and your fellow raccoons built a ship out of a wrecked car, a home appliance, an old carnival ride and other trash. You strive to keep it together for your shipmates, but it’s hard when you don’t really know what you might do from one minute to the next. Rise to your challenges, descend on an unsuspecting house, and try not to wake the residents. Also, if your ship could just not blow up, that would be great.

This is a one-shot playtest. While things may not go strictly according to plan, we’ll have a good time regardless. The tone is light, with slapstick violence.

**System**: Raccoon Sky Pirates. Rules are minimal and will be taught.
**Duration**: One three-hour session
**Breaks**: 10-minute breaks on the hour
**Venue**: Zoom, Google Sheets, playingcards.io
**Recording**: Yes, with permission
**Attendance**: Open door policy
**Safety Tools**: Lines &amp; Veils, X-card. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
