## Rally your amigos, let&#39;s tell a story!

Enter the post-western galaxy of Jedi  *Ruben Carlos Ruiz* , a mold-broken loner in over his head and wholly unafraid. Add a new action-packed, full-throttle planet-hopping adventure to Ruben’s legend as he mavericks his way out of tight situations with bare wits, bravado, and judicious application of violence; after all, he is  ***Trouble For Hire*** . 

Inspired by 70s road and sci-fi movies and contemporary post-westerns,  ***Trouble For Hire***  is a tabletop game that casts players in the various roles involved in telling an exciting action story together. Someone plays Ruben Carlos Ruiz, the central protagonist, of course; but the other players take on roles like  *The Road Through The World*  that contains and threatens him, his trusty sidekick  *La Campañero* , or the mystical strangeness of the inexplicable  *La Extraño* . Play through the several included adventures, or create your own as you work together to spin fabulous, original tales of high-octane cinematic space adventure!
