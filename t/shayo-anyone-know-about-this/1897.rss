    <title>Shayô: Anyone Know about This?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/shayo-anyone-know-about-this/1897</link>
    <description>[Shayô](http://www.legrog.org/jeux/shayo) is a weird, samurai-post apocalyptic fusion rpg from 7ème Cercle. (http://www.legrog.org/editeurs/7eme-cercle) A couple of years ago at Gen Con they were advertising a forthcoming English language version (or at least a Kickstarter for one). That seems to have vanished. I know that Cubicle 7 split with them and dropped supporting their English-language translated lines. But I&#39;d like to know if there&#39;s more to the story. You can&#39;t even find the digital, French version of Shayô on DTRPG.</description>
