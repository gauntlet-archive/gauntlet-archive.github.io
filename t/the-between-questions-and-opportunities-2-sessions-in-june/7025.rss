    <title>The Between: Questions and Opportunities (2 sessions in June)</title>

    <description>**Space for a new player: One spot in this game is reserved for someone new to the Gauntlet, so if you joined in the last six months please message me (via forums or slack) to join the game.** 

The Between is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of mysterious monster hunters in Victorian-era London. These hunters learn about various monstrous threats in the city and conduct investigations, or “hunts,” in order to neutralize them. They gradually become aware of the machinations of a criminal mastermind who is sometimes connected to the threats, but always scheming to bring the Crown to its knees.

Rules: The Between is a pbta game with mechanics based on Brindlewood Bay and a unique, formalised play cycle. No rules knowledge is expected and all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter: The Between is an unavoidably dark game. Murder, cannibalism, body horror, dark sexual themes, threats to children and animals, foul language, blasphemy, witchcraft, and defiling corpses are all things that come up in the game on a fairly regular basis. 

We’ll be using Lines and Veils, the X Card, and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html. 

We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. The sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players. If you’d like to play in both sessions, please rsvp to both events. The first session will include a fair bit of character creation and set up, so I don’t recommend signing up only for that session. 

I’ll send a group email before our first session to confirm interest, share play materials, etc. 

Open access time for sign ups is 10am 4/6/21 AEST.

Session one: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Mb3qGgE70x9NRm8RfmJ
Session two: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Mb3qR8_RaBWD17czSp6</description>
