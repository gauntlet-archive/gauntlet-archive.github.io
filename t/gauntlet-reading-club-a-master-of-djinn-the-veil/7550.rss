    <description>**Gauntlet Reading Club: A Master of Djinn/The Veil**
**Time:** 11 AM PST/GST-8 Sundays in January and February
For the months of January and February, the Gauntlet Reading Club will be reading [A Master of Djinn](https://publishing.tor.com/amasterofdjinn-djelipclark/9781250267689/) by P Djéli Clark paired with [The Veil](https://samjokopublishing.com/products/the-veil-cyberpunk-ttrpg) from Samjoko Publishing. We’ll be incorporating some of Lowell’s Veil’d Fantasy hacks to the game to better emulate A Master of Djinn’s magical steampunk setting.

*Cairo, 1912: Though Fatma el-Sha’arawi is the youngest woman working for the Ministry of Alchemy, Enchantments and Supernatural Entities, she’s certainly not a rookie, especially after preventing the destruction of the universe last summer.*

*So when someone murders a secret brotherhood dedicated to one of the most famous men in history, al-Jahiz, Agent Fatma is called onto the case. Al-Jahiz transformed the world forty years ago when he opened up the veil between the magical and mundane realms, before vanishing into the unknown. This murderer claims to be al-Jahiz, returned to condemn the modern age for its social oppressions. His dangerous magical abilities instigate unrest in the streets of Cairo that threaten to spill over onto the global stage.*

*Alongside her Ministry colleagues and a familiar person from her past, Agent Fatma must unravel the mystery behind this imposter to restore peace to the city—or face the possibility he could be exactly who he seems…*

This first session is to discuss the book we have read together, our thoughts on it, and what we can draw from it to bring into a roleplaying game. We&#39;ll be drawing on the thematic inspiration of *A Master of Djinn* rather than specific plot points, and will have a discussion on tone and content before play, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience.

We&#39;ll be using Streamyard to discuss and play, but the sessions will only be recorded and posted publicly with everyone&#39;s enthusiastic consent to each.

Please note that participation in the initial “book club” session - or at least having read some of the book in advance - will be a requirement for playing in the game.

This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.

**Content Warnings for A Master of Djinn:** Racism, some graphic violence, mind control, at one point to cause self-harm
