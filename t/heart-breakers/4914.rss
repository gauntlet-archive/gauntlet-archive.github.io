    <description>Heart: Breakers
Late addition for April on Thursday 7:30pm GMT 

This is a game of the just released HEART by Grant Howitt &amp; Christopher Taylor,. It takes the narrative-gaming Resistance system of their previous game Spire and rather than chart tales of revolution in the mile-high edifice where drow are subjugated by High Elves, it applies it to the infinite depths beneath it all and the delvers who lose (and find) themselves down there. In short: ever wanted to play a narrative RPG take on heart-of-darkness-as-dungeon-crawl where being a person full of bees is just one of the core classes? Then do we have the game for you.

April 30th: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M3vVzIZyobVGvC8fyXJ

(Also, first proper game I&#39;ve put on the calendar, so at least the GM will be be scared even before the horror creeps into the game.)</description>
