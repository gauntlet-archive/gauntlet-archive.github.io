    <title>Find a Partner and Duet</title>

    <description>On the blog today, @Sarah, @transalaskan, and I share [some of our experiences with two-player rules-facilitated RPGs (&quot;Duets&quot;)](http://gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/find-a-partner-and-duet)! I love the heck out of a duet game and since we already have a stellar post on some of our [favorite duets](https://discourse.funtimers.club/t/recommendations-two-player-gm-less-full-rpgs-duets/706/23), this seemed like as good a time as any to ask the community about games of this type! I&#39;d love to hear your experiences with duets in general, but I&#39;m especially curious to hear:

* How is _your_ play affected by a reduced player count?
* What kinds of experiences do you look for in your duets?
* What skills have you taken back to larger games as a player or a GM?</description>

              <p>Great article you all! Makes me really want to play a duet. I’ve always liked smaller groups, but I’ve never gotten down to 2. I’ll pass on the questions, because I haven’t had the chance to explore any of these games yet, but I love the list you compiled!</p>
