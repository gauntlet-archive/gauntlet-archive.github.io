    <title>Brindlewood Bay: Gauntlet Sunday</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/brindlewood-bay-gauntlet-sunday/5223</link>
    <description>This is four session run of *Brindlewood Bay* in July, Sunday mornings EST. *Brindlewood Bay* is a game of cozy mystery investigation and lurking horror by Jason Cordova. It was published as a standalone project for the Codex zine for Gauntlet patreon supporters, and is [now available for purchase](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/307416/Brindlewood-Bay). Sessions will be three hours in length, and we will play using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). This game will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

Signing up for all sessions is strongly encouraged. If you do sign up for a session but are unable to make it, please let me know, and remove yourself from the sign-up so that whoever is on the waitlist will be notified.

*Brindlewood Bay* is inspired by “cozy mystery” media, such as *Murder She Wrote* , though with an added element of lurking eldritch horror. So, imagine Miss Marple but flavoured with *Twin Peaks* and *The Wicker Man* . In *Brindlewood Bay* , you will all play retired women in the eponymous town - a small whaling town turned tourist trap in New England - who are members of a mystery book club and get embroiled in murder investigations around their home town. As they investigate these seemingly unrelated murders, they may learn deeper secrets pointing to occult forces working behind the scenes of the seaside town.

Content Warning: While the game - especially at the outset - will have a cozy tone, it is ultimately a game about murder, so some themes of violence will be inevitable. While not a high-action game, there is risk to the characters, which can extend to risk to their lives. Likewise, while it is unlikely to form a large part of the game, romance and sexuality are explicitly referenced as part of the characters. There is also a strong theme of supernatural horror, which will become more prevalent as the game progresses, with the possibility for personal and body horror. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.
