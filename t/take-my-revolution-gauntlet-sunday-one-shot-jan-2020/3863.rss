    <description>This is for a one shot of [ *Take My Revolution* ](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/take-my-revolution) by [Jamila R. Nedjadi](https://itch.io/profile/temporalhiccup). Rules will be taught. In the session we’ll discuss tone, choose the game frame, and get to playing.

Your school is beautiful but incredibly strange. There are those who call themselves Swordblooms, and they Duel each other in order to impress World&#39;s End and gain the Divine Sword...in doing so, they will create a revolution. They&#39;ll change the world, for the one they love.

You are now one of these Swordblooms. The school is alive, and it won&#39;t let you leave. You have no choice. You must duel and take your revolution! Or you can fade away into the shadows...

* Heavily inspired by the anime *Revolutionary Girl Utena* .
* Mechanics are from Meguey and Vincent Baker&#39;s excellent casual RPG games: *Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands* and *The King is Dead* .
* 3-5 players
* 2-4 hours
* No Game Master or Facilitator required
* Casual TTRPG, easy to pick up and play
* Pick and choose which game to play!
* Games included are: Dreams &amp; Revelations, An Animated Disagreement, Rising Tensions in an Elevator, A Conversation Over Food, A Dance, Meeting Sword to Sword, Stealing Time Together, Duel With Swords &amp; Hearts, Take My Revolution, Through a Mirror Darkly, Endgame: The Sword&#39;s Choice.
