    <description>I present to you the &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/02/08/crowdfunding-collection-159/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;new Crowdfunding Collection #159, including every tabletop rpg project started between 01/17 and 02/07&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

With the ZineQuest event in full swing, there are no fewer tha 233 ttrpg projects. I split them between „normal“ (107) and „zine“ (126) crowdfunding projects. In this collection, you’ll find the normal ones.
Considering the quite massive amount of projects running, I will skip over an attempt to summarize some, and direct you to the collection to browse at your convenience.

You will find the „ZineQuest“ projects started, within this blog article:
