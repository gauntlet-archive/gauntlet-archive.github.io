          <title>Dungeon World spotlight.... er... etiquette (?)</title>

            <blockquote>
              <p>I’ve been GMing PbtA games (mainly Dungeon World) for years now and I still thoroughly enjoy them. I run a campaign weekly (over Discord) with two old friends and we’re having a great time. (For context, I’ve listened to all the Gauntlet Discern Realites podcasts and regularly read these forums and others around the subject of PbtA, so I feel I understand these games pretty well.)</p>
<p>One thing has started to tickle at the back of my brain recently, though.</p>
<p>When you’re running a PbtA game, spotlight management is obviously really key and the GM/MC is responsible for moving the spotlight around. A thing I have begin to notice recently is that because this task always falls to me, my players are usually <em>waiting</em> for me to turn the spotlight on them (usually with a question, like “you see the paladin go down under a pile of skeletons, what do you do?”). My players are good, they trust me and they get plenty of time in the spotlight because there are just two of them.</p>
<p>So things are happening, we’re following the fiction, moves are snowballing nicely and my players are engaged, listening and waiting. But here’s the point I’m trying to get at: <em>I</em> decide when all the spotlight changes occur. My players have learnt, through play, that this is how the game works. However, in other more “traditional” games that I still play from time to time, players will be interrupting the GM, interjecting, trying to get an action in before something else happens. They do this, I think, because they have similarly learnt that games that have rules regarding who can act in what order (e.g. intiative, speed checks) don’t just move the spotlight based on GM whim. They’re hussling for “the spotlight” and the game sometimes rewards them for that.</p>
<p>In Dungeon World my players <em>don’t</em> hussle for the spotlight. They accept that I will turn it on them when I think it is the right moment. I’ve started to wonder if that’s something I have done wrong (e.g. unwittingly set or reinforced this by own style of GMing) or whether this is just a fact of PbtA games. If it is, I don’t think that I’ve seen this explicitly called out in any PbtA rulebook (e.g. in player advice sections I haven’t seen statements like “be ready to act when the spotlight is turned on you”).</p>
<p>I find myself someone wanting my players to try to jump in, interrupt me, but - rightly or wrongly - they’ve sort of learnt to wait. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Mostly it’s fine but occasionally, in action scenes, I have to explictly “switch on” a player to encourage them to make a reactive move.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rather rambly post. I would appreciate other peoples’ thoughts and opinions on this!</p>

              <p>I’m planning to run a one-shot of My Life With Master and I’d like to give it a Cthulhu Mythos vibe. So  went with the idea that the master is Shub-Niggurath, but I’m struggling with two things right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>I REALLY want the Great Old One herself to feature during the game (maybe via visions that the minions have, but ideally in some physical form), BUT then I realised that the Master needs to come to a sticky end and I don’t think my players will buy Shub-Niggurath being destroyed.</li>
<li>What does a Great Old One like that really want its little minions to <em>do</em>? Minions trying to perform these little (localised) tasks form a large part of the MLWM game.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I’m just looking for some advice and ideas really.</p>
<p>Or, if you had committed yourself to running a one-shot called “My Life With Shub-Niggurath” how would you approach it? <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I prefer PbtA games, but every so often I get the urge to try something like Wrath and Glory or Forbidden Lands. I wondered if many people had a majority negative experiences with Foundry? I haven’t ponied up for it, and was about to, but a player and a good friend said that the experience was enough to make him want to strangle its creators. Admittedly, this player is a little non-technical, but I searched around for reviews and could mostly only find positive reactions.</p>
<p>I was hoping to ask a wider selection of people to see if maybe it would be okay to at least test out (obviously not with that player as it would send him into paroxysms of rage, apparently). I’m thinking, even if the client-server setup is problematic, I could at least use that VTT and share my screen to do a lot of the heavy lifting of those less narrative and more “rules heavy” systems.</p>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of Roll20, personally, and though I like the direction that PlayRole and Owlbear Rodeo are going, they’re still very nascent, and don’t have the modules for these more trad systems like Wrath and Glory, The One Ring and Forbidden Lands.</p>

              <p>As suggested by <a class="mention" href="/u/dereel">@DeReel</a>, a separate thread for my game reports. I also want to make this a place not to just post my links, but have discussion, both of the play and the game itself.</p>
<p>As a context, the players (besides me as a GM with a GM nation), are 10-11 years old. I am using <a href="https://rollforshoes.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Roll For Shoes</a> behind the screens to resolve the actions weekly.</p>
<p>So far we’ve had an <a href="https://thebeardedbelgiansplayground.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-rulers-of-pegolia-2023-begins.html" rel="nofollow noopener">introductory blogpost</a> and a <a href="https://thebeardedbelgiansplayground.blogspot.com/2023/02/rulers-of-pegolia-2023-week-1-update.html" rel="nofollow noopener">first week</a>.</p>
<p>So far the observations do far are:<br>
• Since there are schools where I only am one day a week, lessons have a tendency to fall away during Hollidays, feast days, projects, etc. Which makes it harder to keep it weekly.<br>
• The kids are realizing how slow talking to each other through messaging is. Send a message one week, having to wait the next week as the other party receives it and has to write a reply, …<br>
• Meanwhile, I told them that in their own classroom, if they want to just talk to each other and plan, that’s allowed, but they seem to want to work against each other. Oh well, let’s see how that resolves.</p>

I like Vincent Baker’s Apocalypse World Sex moves and Lure moves from Avery Alder Dream Askew in that they foster “play to support”.<br>
But I don’t find exactly the vibe I want in them. Sex moves are very psychological, very “inside”. Lure moves are based on social utility, very “outside”. I think I’d like something in between. Probably there are some other moves I ignore that I’d like. If I knew what it was I’m looking for, I’d already have created a game for it <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I think it’s something about Fourier’s passions and Johnstone’s status play.</p>

There are also now ready-to-print <a href="https://fantasyworldrpg.com/downloads/Downloads.html" rel="nofollow noopener">PDF playbooks</a>. I’m not too fond of the playbook layout myself, but they are reasonably functional.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: although I helped <a class="mention" href="/u/alessandro_piroddi">@Alessandro_Piroddi</a> with some of the scripting and website shenaningans for this wiki, I’m not involved with the game’s design or its commercial aspect, I only help because I like the game, and it’s released under CC-BY, so this benefits the community at large.</em></p>

<p>One of the players is keen for an adventure just on the spaceship so they have more social Moves occuring.  I keep getting stumped thinking of anything other than a murder mystery.  Also I was wondering if there are any good improv prompt questions like you have for Dungeon Starters to help with single location plots - or “base under siege” like many Doctor Who episodes have.  Possibly an “out of gas” Firefly thing?</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Hi All, WILD is an great game from a UK publisher. I’m eager to give it a second session.<br>
We do carry it on my marketplace: <a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/WILD" rel="nofollow noopener">WILD RPG</a> and <a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/wild-tarot" rel="nofollow noopener">Tarot deck</a><br>
I’ve run a quick 1 on 1 session.<br>
I made a video about it:</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="I3vZlmIBVhQ" data-youtube-title="WILD - RPG Unboxing - Wake Initiated Lucid Dreaming" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<h3>The "Script"​, sortof - for those who prefer text.</h3>
<p>WILD (Wake Initiated Lucid Dreaming) is a dreamshare RPG that can be played as a solo journaling game or by a small group of friends with one taking on the roll of DreamMaster.<br>
In WILD, you might explore the dreams of a coma patient, search for secrets in the mind of a criminal or a troubled youth, or lose yourself in the depths of the collective unconscious.</p>
<p>WILD was created by UK based <em>we evolve</em> , designed by David F. Chapman.</p>
<p>In the setting of WILD, there has been a breakthrough in dreamshare technology. PALIS (Portable accelerated Lucidity Induction System) allows the sharing of curated dream experiences as well as allowing the delving into the dreams of any individual “primary dreamer.”</p>
<p>WILD uses a custom Tarot deck to inspire scenes, obstacles and challenges (situation, obstacle, aid, resolution). The Tarot cards are also used to resolve actions and to create two important parts of your character: their <em>Persona</em> [mostly positive parts of your nature] and their <em>Shadow</em> [the more negative parts]. These primarily inform roleplaying and the rest of your character build but do have special rules if either your Shadow card or Persona card are drawn during action resolution.</p>
<p>4 Attributes are rated from 1 - 6 from 12 points as you chose. <em>Control</em> [physical precision], <em>Strength</em> [physical power endurance], <em>Focus</em> [mental precision], <em>Passion</em> [mental power endurance]. – Each corresponds to a suit.<br>
5 Abilities are rated 4, 3, 2, 2, 1. They are: Scholar, Rogue, Guardian, Diplomat, and Visionary – Each corresponds to a court cards.<br>
You create ~3 aspects which are best when they are both positive+negative based on the situation. “Cautious” will be helpful in some circumstances and a hindrance in others.</p>
<p>For an action requiring resolution you choose one Attribute and one Ability. You draw three cards, + or - 1 card for any relevant aspects.<br>
Any card equal or below the sum of Attribute + Ability generates a success. If a card matches an attribute (suit) or the ability (court card) this also generates a success. It is possible for a single card to generate 3 successes . . .<br>
Major Arcana drawn indicate that some sort of dreamlike effect has occurred. Major Arcana do not contribute successes, they indicate that something unplanned, interesting and dreamlike has transpired. You should pause, look at all the drawn cards for that task and interpret a twist based on their standard or reversed meaning, the text, or imagery on the card.</p>
<p>I recently ran a short game 1 on 1 and the cards do a wonderful job inspiring a dreamlike quality. Simply looking at the cards is very helpful, but the book also lists many suggestions particularly for the situation, obstacle, aid, and resolution in crafting a new scene or location.</p>
<p>The last 42 pages of the 100 page hardcover book is dedicated to the cards, and since this acts as a big random generator of ideas it is space well used. It also allows you to play the game event without picking up a WILD Tarot deck. The book is otherwise broken into a brief introduction, the rules, character generation, a fairly detailed adventure (a training program devised by the creators of the dreamshare PALIS device, where you are delving into the dreams of a coma patient) and a final chapter covering other dream scenarios.</p>
<p>The book positions itself as a bit of a “starter version” and this shows in a lack of rules for character advancement, but there is a ton of playability here.</p>
<p>The cards are gorgeous surreal feeling black and white, with just a hint of color for each of the suit symbols. The finish on them give the cards a bit of a shimmering glitter.</p>
<p>In my 1 on 1 play through our “hero” played a disgraced hedge-fund manager, who had jacked into the dreams of one of his co-founders who had ousted him from their company. He delved into the dreams trying to get dirt on his rival so he could have revenge in the “real world.” He was almost ejected from the dream when they confronted each other in the board-room on the day he’d been ousted. An they both awoke after he became his rivals dog and attacked him. Since PALIS dreams are so real, his rival went to the hospital in the real world.<br>
We basically had our PC draw for everything, though important NPCs could make their own draws. Instead I mostly opted to shift the difficulty (a single success normally generates “Yes, but” result, 2 success a clear win-win, but this can be stepped up one or down one) or required multiple draws.</p>
<p>Hopefully that has peaked your interest in WILD RPG. You can get both the core <a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/WILD" rel="nofollow noopener">rulebook</a> and the <a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/wild-tarot" rel="nofollow noopener">WILD Tarot</a> deck from the <a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/" rel="nofollow noopener">Compose Dream Games RPG Marketplace</a> in either print/physical or PDF/digital versions.<br>
Good gaming!</p>
<h3>Outro​</h3>
<p>I usually don’t state pricepoint in videos, the rulebook is $40 CAD ($31.41 USD), the tarot deck $25 CAD ($19.47 USD) with pdfs at $26 and $16 respectively (~20.24 USD and ~12.45 USD).</p>
<p>Happy to answer questions, I am looking forward to running it the game again!<br>
Have any of you played it or similar Tarot powered games?</p>

But I know that a couple of my students would really enjoy the more narrative style of game.  I’m wondering what you might recommend as a good game to use to showcase the differences.  Keep in mind these are students at a school, ages 13-16; so Monsterhearts and the like are not gonna fly.</p>
<p>I’m not too enthused with Dungeon World, it seems to close to D&amp;D, among other factors. Another fantasy game is fine.</p>
<p>I curious what folks think is best, and why.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Edit: I’m pretty familiar with PBTA and FITD “rulesets” so I’d likely stick to those (not a lot of time to take on new system mastery these days).</p>

              <p>Hi all.<br>
I have been running a trophy gold game for some friends who are all DnD gamers originally. The performance has been leaden at best. My biggest issues seem to stem from players (especially those who are familiar with DnD, this is a reoccuring theme i would say) staying close together, not engaging with anything, not taking risks etc.<br>
If I tell them they see motion out in a field, there’s clearly something going on, their response is to sit around the campfire etc. and not go out to find out whats going on, despite the fact that they are hired essentially to guard a caravan. It is very frustrating. They had an encounter with a troll who, though dangerous, was by no means actually threatening them. They didn’t ask one question of him. They didn’t try to learn about him. They basically stood around and waited for prompts.</p>
<p>Do you have any pointers on enhancing player engagement.</p>

<p>Avoid playing BRINDLEWOOD BAY with five or more players.</p>

<p>This was the first I’ve seen of a player limit - totally on me for preparing too late.</p>
<p>Do you recommend any PbtA  that are good for 5-6 players?<br>
Is the limit because Brindlewood doesn’t play well, or because PbtA doesn’t play well, at that size?</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Soundtracks, ambiences etc. are getting more and more popular, and that’s cool! But I’m looking for instances when someone actually makes music in AP. Do you know examples you could hint at?</p>
<p>I’m generally interested in this music/game intersection (and can talk lots about that), with info gathered here I’m also planning to fill the longer list in the wiki article at: <a href="http://musicgames.wikidot.com/glossary:rpg#examples" rel="nofollow noopener">http://musicgames.wikidot.com/glossary:rpg#examples</a></p>
<p>Already there are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>BomBARDed (that’s mostly edited in); and</li>
<li>Adventurers&amp;Artists, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyXV7biU54k" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyXV7biU54k</a> (here there’s a separate “musical personnel” that improvises in parallel with role-players).</li>
</ul>
<p>I know of one more instance of rapping/recitative in “Tomes of the Chaos Bard”, which is diegetic, but quite short (would link that too, but I still have a limit in posts  <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  ).</p>
<p>Will be very grateful for hints, links, etc. and also opinions from those who enjoy/disdain such elements, or creative details on using it in your actual plays, if you tried or thought about it.</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone has tried running a “classless” variant of Dungeon World. I’m thinking of running a game wherein PCs all start out generic, with access to only the Basic Moves. Then they gain new moves by way of Compendium Classes. Something like that…</p>
<p>To that end, is there a big list of Compendium Classes somewhere?</p>

              <p>Hello,<br>
I was reminded of an old question and a year old answer to it : <a href="https://gwyllgi.itch.io/key-and-token">https://gwyllgi.itch.io/key-and-token</a><br>
The question is : what can you play except from individual characters.</p>
<p>Even in traditional games you can play a collective, like a caravan of nomads, with collective resources and needs. In The Quiet Year I found myself playing a very intriguing entity, something like a political current. I didn’t intend to, and it wasn’t something explicit, it’s just the way I felt. I suppose the game does that.</p>
<p>Maybe some games about IAs can make you feel like not-an-individual, too?</p>
<p>In games like Annalise or Swords Without Masters, you can use Motifs, but you don’t really play as them. Likewise in Apocalypse World, you have a say in shaping this or that entity (the Maelstrom, the Gangs, etc.) but I don’t feel like you play them.</p>
<p>If you did play such characters, please tell me about your experience. is it still Role Playing? XD What is specific about it ? Does it influence relations between players ? Does it shape the kind of fiction told?</p>

              <p>Hi! I was curious: what RPG are you currently playing that could benefit from a digital toolset?</p>
<p>I’ve realized that making a digital toolset is <em>really</em> within my wheelhouse, and I’d love to enable digital play for smaller games.</p>
<p>I’ve asked elsewhere but I keep getting suggestions like <em>GURPS</em> or <em>World of Darkness</em>, which are… bigger than I want. I’m looking at games that are PbtA/FitD/adjacent. One or two authors. My shortlist right now includes games like <em>NOVA</em>, <em>ICON</em>, <em>Fellowship</em>, etc.</p>
<p>If you could pull up a character sheet (or a “GM screen” with all your NPCs and players), click some buttons and have dice roll in your Discord channel, and that’s about it, what systems need some love?</p>
<p>TIA!</p>

[This was also posted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gauntlet.rpg/posts/5226937177416938/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/groups/gauntlet.rpg/posts/5226937177416938/</a>]</p>
<p>I have a gaming weekend coming up and I’m looking at running Brindlewood Bay which I find very interesting.</p>
<p>The book says the game is planned for ±12 sessions, and also presents a short one-shot option.</p>
<p>I have ±12 hours net playing time over 2 days, and I want to go full circle, all the way to the void mystery. Do you have any tips on making it work?</p>
<p>I’m thinking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intro, character creation - 1h</li>
<li>Short first mystery [maybe complexity 4?] - 2h</li>
<li>Two longer mysteries, 3h each [complexity 6?] - 3h * 2</li>
<li>The Void Mystery - 3h</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this make sense?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m concerned it’s somewhat rushed and maybe will make it hard for the players to get in the mood</li>
<li>Does a complexity 4 mystery work?</li>
<li>Is it feasible to complete complexity 6 mysteries within 3h?</li>
<li>Will it make sense to dish out ±5 void clues in ±3 short mysteries?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>
