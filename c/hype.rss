              <p>My Kickstarter for the first three playsets using the Tableau Games <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/flower_playing_cards.png?v=9" title=":flower_playing_cards:" class="emoji" alt=":flower_playing_cards:"> system is ending this Monday (the 17th), and you don’t want to miss out on this opportunity.</p>
<p>Tableau Games is a versatile and innovative game system that uses composable rules on poker-sized playing cards to create a unique and immersive roleplaying experience. The Kickstarter offers three initial playsets - Twilight Road🛣️, Gate Watch🚪, and Improv🎪. Each playset is designed to cater to different storytelling styles and themes, ensuring there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p>Twilight Road🛣️ takes players on transformative journeys and life-changing encounters, while Gate Watch🚪 is all about mystery, intrigue, and exploring the edges of different worlds. Improv🎪 is perfect for roleplaying, creative writing, and theatre improv enthusiasts who want to embrace the “Yes, and…” spirit in spontaneous storytelling.</p>
<p>The Tableau Games system is flexible, allowing you to choose GM or GM-less play, different narrative styles, player roles, and mix &amp; match story elements to create the perfect story for your group. Character creation is also versatile, with endless combinations using Face, Mastery, Approach, and Path cards.</p>
<p>Additionally, there’s an “Advanced Playtester” tier available for backers who want to help shape the future of Tableau Games. By joining this tier, you’ll be the first to test upcoming playsets like “Lovecraft Country: ‘A Study in Madness’”, “Generations”, and “Steampunk Oz” coming out later this year.</p>
<p>I’ve written up more on about these Tableau Games playset and their design on Twitter at <span class="mention">@DvyersHands</span>.

<p>With  <strong>Tableau</strong> , you can let your imagination run wild and experience a unique and engaging way of storytelling that’s perfect for anyone who loves gaming, storytelling, or just having fun with friends.</p>
<h3>Overview of Play</h3>
<p><strong>Tableau</strong>  works by providing players with a shared space called  <em>The Table</em> , which acts as a structure for the stories that they tell. Using  <strong>Tableau</strong>  cards that represent rules and storytelling elements, players can choose some to place on  <em>The Table</em>  with  <em>Table Consent</em> , which is when everyone agrees on a choice made together.</p>
<p>The game includes different types of  <strong>Tableau</strong>  cards, such as  <em>Safety</em> ,  <em>Narrative</em> ,  <em>Player Role</em> ,  <em>Casting</em> ,  <em>Drama</em> ,  <em>Story</em> , and  <em>Character</em>  cards, which allow players to create and develop unique characters and explore different story elements. Index cards are also used to demonstrate  <em>Table Consent</em>  for any rules or story elements not covered by  <strong>Tableau</strong>  cards, and they can be updated with significant details as the story progresses.</p>
<p>Additionally, players can  <em>Take Up</em>  some cards to give someone control over its story elements and the authority to use its  <em>Moves</em> .</p>
<p>For instance, for a simple road trip story using some of the 72-cards of  <em>Twilight Road</em>  <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/motorway.png?v=9" title=":motorway:" class="emoji" alt=":motorway:"> the storytellers might choose to put the following cards on  <em>The Table</em> :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Twilight Road</em>  Playset cards</li>
<li>
<em>Twilight Road</em>  Beats cards</li>
<li>
<em>Play Controls</em>  Safety Rule</li>
<li>
<em>Scenes</em>  Narrative Rule</li>
<li>
<em>Truths &amp; Questions</em>  Narrative Rule</li>
<li>
<em>Drama Tokens</em>  Drama Rule card</li>
<li>
<em>The Twilight</em>  Theme card</li>
<li>
<em>The Road</em>  Setting card</li>
<li>
<em>The Locals</em>  Setting card</li>
<li>
<em>The Director</em>  Player Role card</li>
<li>
<em>The Mapper</em>  Player Role card</li>
<li>
<em>The Driver</em>  Face card</li>
<li>
<em>The Buddy</em>  Face card</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p><img src="//gauntlet-discourse-store.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/2/23b78116be1ce2ccc5e9d773757300fc08b5957e.png" alt="Storytellers Hand of Cards" data-base62-sha1="55XRMJ9e3aJIEXdr7CiHyzpdGFw" width="680" height="383"></p>
<p>For a basic story, the storytellers will typically hold three or four cards — a  <em>Player Role</em>  card, a  <em>Story</em>  Card, and one or two  <em>Character</em>  cards. The front side has the  <em>Setup</em>  details, and the back the  <em>Moves</em>  available while holding these cards. The story is told in a series of  <em>Scenes</em> , following the instructions of the  <em>Beats</em>  card on the  <em>Table</em> . Between  <em>Scenes</em>  the  <em>Director</em>  Player Role card is passed around, and  <em>Story</em>  cards can be  <em>Set Aside</em>  or  <em>Taken Up</em> . The  <em>Drama Tokens</em>  card defines how a token pool, ala “Fate” or “Belonging Outside Belonging” is used to create karma and tension. The  <em>Beats</em>  cards will guide the storytellers to a satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>A different group might choose to substitute  <em>The Narrator</em>  for  <em>The Director</em>  player role for a more GM-style game or to run the last act of a mystery; or choose  <em>The Renegade</em>  instead of the  <em>The Buddy</em>  Face for a more Jack Kerouac  <em>“On the Road”</em>  style road trip; or  <em>The Entertainer</em>  Face for a  <em>“Blues Brothers”</em>  road trip. The  <em>Declare</em>  Drama Rules Card could be substituted for a more PbtA style of tension and risk. Rules from other playsets could be added, for instance  <em>The Other Side</em>  setting from the  <em>Gate Watch</em>  Playset could be a home for  <em>The Outsider</em>  Face card.</p>

              <p>Low-Res Futures contains two full roleplaying games, each written by an accomplished designer.</p>
<p><em>Handbaskets</em> is a digitally enhanced, cyberwitch, demon-summoning battle royale game by Maxwell Lander (<em>Himbos</em>). Players try to maximize their reputation, take out the competition, and stay alive. But death isn’t the end—those who fall are “resleeved” into strange and entertaining new bodies to continue the entertainment.</p>
<p><em>In a Mirror Brightly</em> is a game of millenarian magical rebellion by Aaron King (<em>Patchwork World</em>). Wake up from the drudgery of everyday life in 199X and fight for the best future you can imagine! Inspired by The Invisibles, The Matrix, and Mage: The Awakening, players will fight the power with tech, hex, and sex.</p>
<p>Character creation rules for <em>In a Mirror Brightly</em> are avaiable for preview<br>

              <p>I’ve launched a 2 week kickstarter for Inner Circle, a lightweight ‘beer &amp; pretzels’ style RPG which can be played in just 30 minutes or so.</p>
<p>The players get to be a group of ‘yes-men’ coming up with terrible and inane plans to curry favour with their horrible boss, using a simple form of blackjack as the game mechanic to see who wins each round. Losers see their credibility diminish, and when you run out, you get to narrate your horrible exit from the game. If playing as imperial admirals you might be force-choked. If henchmen of the Joker in Gotham city you might be shown the pencil trick. If working for Big Tech or Big Pharma you might be fired or imprisoned, if you are squabbling academics you might lose tenure.</p>
<p>I’ve got a modest goal, to meet editing and printing costs. It would be great if you could take a look and perhaps share or back the project!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

              <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2022/10/31/crowdfunding-collection-202/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #202, including every tabletop rpg project started between 10/23 and 10/30</b></a>.</p>
<p>The collection is back to the weekly rythm and hence features a more digestible amount of projects.</p>
<p><b>Heist – The Roleplaying Game</b> is one project that immediatly caught my attention. The games is inspired by movies like Ocean’s 11, series like Better Call Saul and videogames like the GTA series of games. As that’s quite a broad field, even as it tends to focus on the lighter aspects of the genre, the focus on the various aspects does vary, Though the cooperative creation of the setting should aid the group in adjusting it to their taste. Systemwise it uses a 2d10 system, which works with set difficulties and considers the margin of how close or how much above one managed to roll. The general design approach is to have the system support the game, and offering enough room to be unobstrusive during play. The game is available in English and German, and I do recommen having a look.<br>
I did as well consider <b>Diapers &amp; Daycares</b> as I like the parody presented, yet am hestitating as the small book delivery is focused to the US and am not entirely sure how long the idea would entertainment. Another interesting project is the <b>Eye To The Void</b> sourcebook, offering insight into various Divination approaches and how to use them for a game.<br>
There are of couse many more interesting projects, like the ttrpg about trans-human stories or a new edition of Paranoia or the charcuterie dice that poked my appetite. Just have a look and decide for yourself which projects fit your interests:</p>
<p><b>English Crowdfundings</b></p>

              <p>Eero Tuovinen has finally finished writing <em><strong>Muster - A Primer for War. Advice for playing D&amp;D the wargaming way</strong></em>! I excitedly <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/muster-a-new-old-school-primer/6188/3">reported on the project in an earlier thread</a>.</p>
<p>It is <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/413382/Muster?affiliate_id=197393" rel="nofollow noopener">now available <strong>for free</strong> at DriveThruRPG</a>.</p>
<p>(It’s technically pay-what-you-want so you can tip him, but he’s made it clear at DriveThruRPG and elsewhere that it’s free and free to share.)</p>
<p>It’s taken longer than anticipated, but it’s also grown from it’s early estimated length of 50 pages to 250+ pages! Fortunately, (1) there’s <strong>a brief manifesto at the beginning</strong> and (2) it’s been <strong>split into a basic and advanced section</strong> .</p>
<p>I think it’s a stellar piece of work, providing both <strong>practical advice for storygamers new to this style of play</strong> and <strong>theoretical observations and surprises for RPG aficionados</strong> in general.</p>
<p>Among other things, Eero offers a mature take on <strong>Chauvinism and D&amp;D</strong> and penetrating observations about <strong>‘The Nihilistic Void’</strong> encroaching on long-term campaigns conducted in the wargaming way — but <strong>judge for yourself</strong>!</p>

              <p>Tomorrow is the start of Blackmoor Week - which ends on October 1st with Dave Arneson Game day! In general people are encouraged to learn more about the inventor of our hobby, and perhaps get something “old school” to the table.<br>
Personally I encourage folks to check out the Secrets of Blackmoor documentary <a href="https://www.secretsofblackmoor.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.secretsofblackmoor.com/</a><br>
Maybe swing by <a href="https://blackmoor.mystara.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blackmoor.mystara.net/</a> or try and find a copy of <em>Champions of ZED</em> – a really cool game based on extensive research that attempted to synergize the vision and work of both Arneson and Gygax.</p>
<p>For my bit, each year for Blackmoor Week I run our only site-wide sale. Everything on the <em>Compose Dream Games RPG Marketplace</em> is <strong>20% off</strong>. Just use coupon code “Arneson” on the shopping cart page.<br>

<p>The 200. edition of the collection covers two week and happens to feature exactly 200 active projects; even a Japanese ttrpg – the last one was in 2020. With the Zine Quest being a big reason why so many projects got launched.</p>
<p>Of the projects I like to highlight <b>Mail Order Apokalypse</b>. It’s a zine-sized ttrpg about mail being delivered in a post apocalypse using Into the Odd inspired rules.<br>
I did consider doing a brief introduction of all the games to honor the 200. edition, yet, well,…. 73 games are a few to many,… thus, take a look for yourself:</p>

<p>The game is complete but still “in development” as I got some feedback from friendly fans of Ariana Grande.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s the pitch.</p>
<p>Ariana Grande, the beloved pop icon, and her closest entourage were introduced to Vampire the Masquerade™ by a Stranger Things™ cast member. Carried away by her legendary enthusiasm, and a slight misunderstanding of TTRPG, Ariana started her quest to reveal David Boreanaz’s true vampiric nature. It’s up to YOU, this VtM™ table pulled from her closest entourage, to prevent this situation from turning into a disaster.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you think it’s worth playing or just something too silly.</p>

              <p>Inspired by slow fantasy worlds like those of Earthsea, Princess Mononoke, Mushi-shi and Sahdow of the Colossus, Ryne is a PbtA game about people holding things together in a world that is falling apart.</p>
<p>Players wander emotional landscapes, discover the secrets of the Remnants, and inhabit communities whose customs and beliefs are shaped by the titans. Ryne is built around emotions - landscapes are shaped by feeling, places and landmarks have moods of their own. The stories your characters weave will be guided by their emotions, which take the place of skill and evolve over time as you play.</p>

<p>We’re really proud of the work we’ve done on Ryne - we’d obviously love it if you’d help us hit our funding goal, but we’re equally excited to talk about it with other designers and enthusiasts. While we are broadly a pbta game, we genuinely think we’ve done something exciting and different with Ryne, and how it plays!</p>

<p>The collections covers a bit more than a months because I had two weeks of vacation and because Kickstarters „bot protection“ managed to kill my will (and ability) to do it for a while as I couldn’t do the searches or open the projects. I found a work around, which makes the compilation take longer, and acquired the energy required and thus am back…<br>

              <p>In his last newsletter, Thomas Manuel mentions “Entanglements” from Hearts of Wulin. Strange, as character relationship maps are old as Vampire the Masquerade 1e. I would have chosen “Inner conflict” and Scales, two really great and innovative approaches. But that was nice of him anyway! and it’s true that the <strong>list</strong> of entanglements is really neat.</p>
