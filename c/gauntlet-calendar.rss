<p>For the latter half of June through to July, I’ll be running a series of Girls by Moonlight using the At the Brink of the Abyss playset. Girls by Moonlight is a magical girl roleplaying Forged in the Dark about characters fighting against doom with the aid of magical powers and some fancy transformation animations.</p>
<p>The At the Brink of the Abyss is specifically focused on characters fighting for a world worth saving from an encroaching evil that threatens to destroy it. The protagonists might be flawed, but they’re ultimately heroic, and even the darkest villains have the possibility of being redeemed. Good touchstones for the tone include Sailor Moon as well as She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.</p>
<p>The game will take place over zoom, and will be recorded, although I will only post the recordings with everyone’s enthusiastic consent. As always, we will be making use of The Open Hearth’s Open Door Policy, the x-card, script change, and line and veils. One seat has been reserved for Mona.</p>

<p>This is a posting for a quarterly run of Voidheart Symphony by Minerva McJanda, a game powered by the apocalypse about mundane people who have discovered that the injustice and inequality underlying the institutions of their city are being empowered by a parasitic dimension feeding off of our suffering. Together, we’re going to band together to venture into demon-filled labyrinths, take down the Castle’s avatars, and take back our city!</p>
<p>The big touchstone for the game is obviously Persona 5, if the characters were more explicitly revolutionary in their goals, but another media source that speak to me for inspiration are NK Jemisin’s The Great Cities novels.</p>
<p>We’ll be making use of script change, the x-card, lines and veils, as well as the Open Hearth’s Open Door policy.</p>
<p>This game will take place over Zoom and will be recorded only if everyone involved gives their consent.</p>
<p>A seat has been reserved for Jesse A.</p>

              <p><strong>Didn’t think this one through and hit a big scheduling conflict. Still keen to run this so will come back to reschedule in a month or so.</strong></p>
<p>NO ONE KNOWS WHAT CAUSED THE EVENT. Alien visitors? Collision with another dimension? Whatever it was, it sundered an area on Earth from the laws of nature. And it left wonders behind. Authorised expeditions are rare, but there are plenty of willing buyers for black market salvage if you’re willing to break the quarantine. Be careful, though: Come back not-quite-human, and the Lab will insist you visit indefinitely.</p>
<p>ZONE is a rules-light, improvisational scifi game by Jason Tocci about a once-ordinary landscape where the laws of physics no longer apply, inspired by stories like Roadside Picnic and the Southern Reach Trilogy. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play.</p>
<p>I don’t think there are any specific subject matter warnings for this game. A tone of pervasive creepiness and wonder. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door. The game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct</p>
<p>Please sign up for all sessions you want to attend, but sessions will be pretty episodic so it’s fine to drop in and out.</p>

              <p>It is darkest winter in Octonagon, in the heart of Iron Country. As midwinter approaches, people have reported strange sightings around the Sylvan WIlds, and not just in the deepest parts of the forest where such things are known to hide, but in the clearings closer to Last Pine, where teens go to drink, where lovers go to meet and where dealers hide their stash. And nearby, always the icepick tone of an electric guitar, playing the Cold Iron Blues.</p>
<p><strong>This is a series of 5 games of Bump in the Dark on Wednesday evenings in May at 8PM Eastern US Time.</strong> Bump in the Dark is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of people who, for better or worse, have dedicated their lives to hunting and dealing with monsters. There are gruesome attacks, tense investigations, nasty cryptids, nefarious factions, powerful demons, action-packed showdowns, and regular folk caught in the middle. This is a game about investigating strange mysteries and fighting monsters. <strong>Content Warnings for dark horror themes and body horror.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. A seat is being saved. We will use Google Meet for our sessions. All Access time is Thursday, M arch 9th at 7:30 PM US Eastern. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links and resources. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">The Gauntlet Code of Conduct</a> will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg" rel="nofollow noopener">X-Card</a>, as well as Script Change for safety tools.</p>

              <p>For the months of May and June, the Gauntlet Reading Club will be reading <em><strong>Black Sun</strong></em> , Book 1 of Rebecca Roanhorse’s Between Earth and Sky trilogy, using it as inspiration for a run of <em><strong>The Sword, The Crown, and The Unspeakable Power</strong></em> , a game of dark fantasy Powered by the Apocalypse.</p>
<p><strong>Content Warnings for <em>Black Sun</em> : References to historical act of genocide. Blood magic. Reference to hand trauma suffered by one character in their past. Depictions of violence. Depiction of the ritual blinding of a POV character as a child in the first chapter.</strong></p>
<p><em>In the holy city of Tova, the winter solstice is usually a time for celebration and renewal, but this year it coincides with a solar eclipse, a rare celestial event proscribed by the Sun Priest as an unbalancing of the world.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a ship launches from a distant city bound for Tova and set to arrive on the solstice. The captain of the ship, Xiala, is a disgraced Teek whose song can calm the waters around her as easily as it can warp a man’s mind. Her ship carries one passenger. Described as harmless, the passenger, Serapio, is a young man, blind, scarred, and cloaked in destiny. As Xiala well knows, when a man is described as harmless, he usually ends up being a villain.</p>
<p>Session 1 will be a book discussion group for volume 1 of <em><strong>Black Sun</strong></em> . During the run, we’ll be drawing on it for thematic inspiration rather than specific plot points, and will have a discussion on tone and content before play, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience.</p>

This is for a 90 minute discussion and Q&amp;A about <em>Hearts of Wulin</em>. Lowell will go over about the system, what he’s learned in running it, ideas for tweaks, the best inspirations, and answers to common questions. But then we’ll open it up to a general talk about about questions folks have, best practices, ideas for hacks, running romance, using wuxia with other genres-- whatever folks are interested in. I’d love to get folks’ ideas, insights, feedback-- and especially what has worked (or not worked for you).</p>

              <p>There is something rotten in the Low Cantrefs. No-one knows when it started but all agree that the land is living under a shadow. Fields are planted. Cottages are built, and roofs thatched. Namedays and baptisms are celebrated, and the harvest welcomed in. Babies are born. People fall in love, make new friends, cling to grudges, and forgive old wrongs. And as faded traces of past glories crumble around them, children grow up.</p>
<p><strong>LINK: <a href="https://app.playabl.io/games/52" rel="nofollow noopener">https://app.playabl.io/games/52</a></strong></p>
<p>Tales from the Low Cantrefs is a hearth fantasy coming-of-age roleplaying game built on the Apocalypse World engine. It is a game filled with petty village politics, childhood superstitions, adults who just don’t understand, strange magics, wild and ruined Landscapes, monsters out of old folktales, and the terrible responsibility of growing up. Its main themes are adolescence and self-acceptance, grief and sacrifice, and duty and responsibility, all against the backdrop of a slowly-gathering apocalypse.</p>
<p><strong>CW: The PCs are all children and adolescents, and children will be put in danger in this story. It will include conflict between parents and their adolescent children. It will also involve violence and its consequences, as well as long term decay. Though individual stories may have happy endings, the overall tone is that of a world in decay, and in the end everything will not be OK.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a series of 8 games of Tales from the Low Cantrefs Playtest on Monday evening in March and April at 8PM Eastern US Time.</strong> Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. All-Access time is 2/10 at noon. A seat is being saved.</p>

<p>To celebrate the release of the <em><strong>DIE RPG</strong></em> , the Gauntlet Reading Club will be reading volume one of Kieron Gillen and Stephanie Hans’s <em><strong>DIE</strong></em> , then playing a run of the game created to emulate the drama of a bunch of estranged roleplaying friends getting transported into their gaming group’s old stomping grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Content Warnings for DIE: Depictions of violence, parental loss and mind control.</strong></p>
<p><em>DIE is a pitch-black fantasy where a group of forty-something adults have to deal with the returning unearthly horror they barely survived as teenage role-players. If Kieron’s in a rush, he describes it as “Goth Jumanji.” That only captures a sliver of what you’ll find in oversized debut issue—where fantasy gets all too real.</em></p>
<p>Session 1 will be a book discussion group for volume 1 of <em>DIE</em> . During the run, we’ll be drawing on the thematic inspiration of <em>DIE</em> rather than specific plot points, and will have a discussion on tone and content before play, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience.</p>
<p>We’ll be using Zoom to discuss and play, but the sessions will only be recorded and posted publicly with everyone’s enthusiastic consent.</p>
<p>This game will take place under the <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct</a> and the safety tools <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m" rel="nofollow noopener">Script Change </a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg" rel="nofollow noopener">X-Card</a> will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials. A seat has been reserved for a player from off-gauntlet.</p>

              <p><em>The Kalduhr is a vast and dangerous forest grown over the ruins of civilizations stretching back millenia. The most storied of these civilizations—though certainly not the oldest—is known as Old Kalduhr. Every treasure-hunter has heard of the ancient Kalduhri people. They know somewhere in the forest are the ruins of an ancient city. Searching the deep wood for these ruins requires a desperation or an arrogance to match the Old Kalduhri people. Roots of Old Kalduhr is a mega-incursion. Unlike regular incursions, there is no way a group of treasure-hunters can explore the entirety of it in one attempt—it is too vast, and must be explored again and again, perhaps with the same treasure-hunters who have survived to tell of the place, or perhaps with new treasure-hunters who have discovered it for themselves.</em></p>

Earn extra income. Now with safety features to make sure you get home safe.</em>*</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#iHunt</span> is a Fate-based game by Olivia Hill and Filamena Young. You play ordinary people trying to make ends meet by hunting monsters despite terrible pay and conditions, with the unavoidable knowledge that capitalism is the real horror.</p>
<p>I’m going to shift the rules towards the simpler Fate Condensed, and might try out some other house rules. New players are welcome. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play.</p>
<p>The tone of the game is kinda darkly humorous action with horror elements. Subject matter includes usual horror stuff - violence, gore, etc - but also poverty, inequality, exploitation, and other social issues. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>We’ll be playing over Streamyard, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll send an email about a week before the first session to share play materials, confirm attendance, etc. I’ll ask if it’s okay to record and share the sessions, and will only do so with consent from all players.</p>

<p><em>Defy the Gods</em> is a queer sword &amp; sorcery adventure. It’s set in an ancient, pseudo-Mediterranean world that you build at the table. Stand between titanic forces at odds with each other—gods, rulers, beasts, spirits, mutating sorcery and Death. As you advance, gain incandescent glory while drawing closer to your doom. It’s inspired by the main conflict in <em>Princess Mononoke</em> and all the weird moments in  <em>Conan the Barbarian</em>,  <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, and <em>Beastmaster</em>. Character options include a Sword, Sorcerer, Mystic, Sailor, or Wolfling.</p>
<p>This is a playtest of a game that is pretty far along. It’s different from the <em>other</em> Defy the Gods playtest that’s running in January and February. One seat is reserved for Rae Nedjadi.</p>
<p>Each session is scheduled to run for 4 hours, although the first session may be shorter. If everyone agrees, I’ll record them.</p>
<p>There will be 4 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.</p>

              <p>The Skein, uncanny and terrible, exists beneath and behind our world as an amorphous, fluid, warping, and twisting plane of semi-existence. The Skein is a parasitic reality, siphoning off energy and thought from the shared dreamspace of humanity. The Skein doesn’t exist at all, you cannot find it. The Skein is all that exists, the so-called real world is only a comforting dream.</p>
<p>You used to be just an ordinary person, but you have stumbled into the endless rooms of the Skein. Welcome. Now, if you can, leave before the Skein sinks its hooks into you, reforming you into a new shape.</p>
<p>Liminal Horror is a rules-light modern horror game by Goblin Archives, based on Cairn and Into The Odd. The rules are available free online at <a href="https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/</a>. Layers of Unreality is a procedurally-generated ‘void crawl’ by Josh Hittie, inspired by the backrooms creepypasta. I don’t know what that is but it seems cool!</p>
<p>No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. Note that because the Skein is procedurally generated, I’ll be pausing when you enter a new room to roll on a bunch of tables and find out where you’ve ended up. Maybe that will be kinda clunky, if it turns out it’s too awkward I’ll switch and preroll the rooms but that seems less exciting. I’m sure it will be fun either way.</p>
<p>The tone is creepy, atmospheric horror. Subject matter includes reality and identity breakdown, body horror, possible violence and gore. We’ll use lines and veils, the romance matrix, the X card and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>We’ll be playing over Streamyard, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll send an email about a week before the first session to share play materials, confirm attendance, etc. I’ll ask if it’s okay to record and share the sessions, and will only do so with consent from all players.</p>
<p>Attending both sessions is not required, but please sign up for all sessions you’d like to attend.</p>
<p>Open access time for sign ups will be 12.30pm 4 January AEDT.</p>

<p><em>For a long time, we were at war with The Jackals. Now, finally, we’ve driven them off, and we’re left with this: a year of relative peace. One quiet year, with which to build our community up and learn again how to work together. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive the encounter. This is when the game will end. But we don’t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quiet Year is a map game. You define the struggles of a community living after the collapse of civilization, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year. Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.</p>
<p>The game is played using a deck of cards – each of the 52 cards corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each card triggers certain events – bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck. At the end of the quiet year, the Frost Shepherds will come, ending the game.</p>
<p>The Quiet Year occupies an interesting space – part roleplaying game, part cartographic poetry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You are a predator: a vampire who stalks human prey in the night, feasting on their blood.</em></p>
<p><em>Blood is life. It’s eating, drinking, breathing, and screwing, all wrapped up in one little, crimson drop. Your thirst for blood is blinding and drinking it – that’s ecstasy. Feeding from prey isn’t just sucking on a juice box; it’s going to a fine restaurant.</em></p>
<p><em>You will go to any length to feed. The craving to do so is ever-present. Even when you swallow your fill of blood, the devil whispers in your ear, tempting you to drink more. Go hungry and the beast takes over. The beast is the relentless beating in your lifeless heart; it craves excess, cruelty, and destruction. Between feast and famine, restraint and recklessness, a predator’s unlife offers more than an eternal, blood-junkie existence. Immortality is the reward that awaits a predator who can balance on the knife edge.</em></p>
<p><em>Predators are the apex: the union of man’s scheming ingenuity and beast’s instinctive ferocity. Though man and lesser creatures are sheep to the wolf, the wolf is among a pack of wolves. And in this pack, the most cunning and ruthless is the alpha. All predators envy that power and prestige. They nip at each other nightly, fighting over the scraps. Each hopes to one night rule the pack. Thus, from the greatest predator to the least, all are embroiled in a ceaseless conflict of intrigue and bloodshed.</em></p>
<p><em>This is what it means to be a predator. This is Undying.</em></p>

              <ul>
<li>
<strong>Concept</strong> : A game of Arthurian romance, telling tales of battle and heartbreak, with players in the roles of champions, errants, lieges, paragons, sorcerers, and villains.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aim</strong> : To play to see what happens.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tone</strong> : Exciting and melodramatic.</li>
<li>
<strong>Subject Matter</strong> : Action and (non-explicit) violence. Romance and (non-explicit) sex. A legendary medieval setting, containing feudalism, miracles, and magic. Your heroes can be any race, class, gender, sexuality, and religion. (This is legend, not history, so “historical accuracy” does not apply.) Safety tools (Open-Table, X-Card, and Lines &amp; Veils) will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hearts of Camelot</strong> is a <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/hearts-of-wulin.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Hearts of Wulin</a>-inspired game of Arthurian romance. You will create heroes from a selection of playbooks (Champion, Errant, Liege, Paragon, Sorcerer, Villain) and establish Entanglements. I will improvise a story around your characters and their relationships. We will play to see what happens.</p>
<p>This will be a five-session “campaign”. Participation in all five sessions is encouraged.</p>
<p>We’ll be playing in Camelot’s “Kingdom of Adventures” period. ( <em>Arthur, now an adult, has secured his crown against threats both foreign and domestic. Merlin is missing and presumed dead. The Round Table is firmly established, but one knight, Sir Balin, has committed a shameful deed with metaphysical consequences, and the kingdom is plagued by adventures in need of redress by heroes. Just in time, Lancelot has arrived to secure his place as the Round Table’s foremost knight. Arthur and Guinevere rule from Camelot, holding court, rendering judgments, distributing gifts, and assigning quests.</em> ) This is the default, recommended time period for the game, characterized by adventures and courtship. During this period, heroes have relative liberty to pursue activities of interest to them, without getting swept into the national upheavals of other time periods.</p>
<p>These will be three-hour sessions, each with two 5-minute breaks, hosted online. The sessions will not be recorded. Rules will be taught. I’ll email players before the game to confirm attendance, share play materials (a character keeper with a rules summary and playbooks), and provide a Zoom link.</p>
<p>This game will follow the <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>An RPG about life, interrupted (by Garfield).</p>
<p><em>You are sitting on a beach, alone with your thoughts.</em></p>
<p><em>At a crossroads, you ponder the choices that led you here, and what you should do next. A voice mutters quietly behind you,</em></p>
<p><em>“I hate Mondays.”</em></p>
<p><em>You turn and see a small, misshapen, orange beast. Its bulbous eyes reflect weariness and an unceasing hunger.</em></p>
<p><em>You think to yourself,</em></p>
<p><em>“not again…”</em></p>
<p>This is a two-player RPG about a person experiencing major milestones in their life, at which time they also are visited by Garfield.</p>
<p>One player plays the Human, and the other plays Garfield.</p>
<p>We will create our characters (Human + Garfield) and then play out scenes that revolve around major milestones in the Human’s life that Garfield appears in, uninvited and unexpected but not unwelcome.</p>

              <p>(Edited to fix the Cairn link)</p>
<p><strong>One spot in the Himbos game is saved for José. One spot in the Cairn game is saved for Blake Ryan. I don’t recommend signing up for both of these games, but if you really want to, please don’t sign up for the second for at least 48 hours.</strong></p>
<p>I thought I’d try running this adventure in two different systems, partly bc I am interested in how different it turns out but partly just bc it seems like a really fun adventure and I wanna play both these games.</p>
<p>Himbos is a rules-light fantasy game by Maxwell Lander about big, bold, brave, compassionate but not particularly smart adventurers of all genders. Cairn is a rules-light fantasy game by Yochai Gal about more standard hardscrabble adventurer types, based on Into The Odd. Both are OSR-influenced but Himbos has a fairly light, campy tone and Cairn has a more desperate-and-deadly playstyle. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play.</p>
<p>Demon Driven To The Maw is a module by Brad Kerr that sees the party track down the thief of a magical jewel to a castle where a big party is underway. Of course, something terrible is happening at the party, but maybe you can still retrieve the jewel and escape with your lives.</p>
<p>Subject matter in these games will include alcohol use, peril to a child, claustrophobia and violence. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the games will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>I’ve listed both games for four hours to make sure we have enough time, but expect we’ll finish closer to three hours.</p>
<p>I’ll email players prior to the sessions to share play materials and other details.</p>
