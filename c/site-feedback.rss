              <p>Hello,<br>
It seems that I missed my first game on the Gauntlet Calendar because of a stupid mistake: the game was announced in the Calendar as “Tuesday, March 22nd 2022, 12:00 am”<br>
To frenchie me, this was obviously on tuesday, march the 22nd, one hour after 11:00 am. I still wonder why it’s not. Right now I’m angry at the persons who thought that error (I can’t think of it any other way) needed to exist, because I both missed a much waited game and was rude to my partners by not showing up.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Confusion_at_noon_and_midnight">strongly suggest</a> changing the time display format on the Calendar.</p>

              <p>Hi, I started listening to Discern Realities and love it, and wanted to add +1 forward to my playlist… However, the RSS feed only lists the last 100 episodes, and I can’t find any way to get a feed that properly contains all of the episodes… I’m kind of weird, I need to start from the beginning of things, hard for me to jump in mid-stream.</p>
<p>Any idea how I can get an RSS with all the episodes that I can either link to or import into my podcast app?  (I’m using Overcast, or Downcast, and I tried aggregations from a few sites like PodChaser, RPGGeeks, and the Gauntlet site itself, but the only feeds I could get to work were the 100-limited ones.</p>
<p>Any thoughts appreciated!  Thanks!</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check the RSVP Site</h2>
<p>To see the schedule of games and to RSVP, go to the website linked below. Once you login, event start times will be listed in your local timezone (when not logged in, times shown are EDT). By default, games are presented in a list, with upcoming games at the top. You can see the games presented in different forms by clicking All Events Info or Calendar.</p>

<p>So I:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to the RSVP Site</li>
<li>click Login up top</li>
<li>select my google account</li>
<li>Login window closes but I am not logged in</li>
<li>click Login up top, again</li>
<li>Login window pops up, quick loading animation, and it closes again</li>

<p>and it says:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Gauntlet Hangouts is our space for playing roleplaying games online. Our calendar hosts over 200 game events per month. The games played cover a variety of systems and genres, with an emphasis on indie RPGs, story games, and the OSR. People who subscribe to our Patreon at the $8+ level get one week of RSVP priority for all new games. After that week is over, anyone can join a game. If the game you want to join doesn’t have room, join the waitlist! You’ll receive an email notification if space opens up.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This <em>seems</em> to suggest, since Patreon = priority, there is a non-Patreon (non-priority) way to engage as well, but I’m still not seeing how to proceed.</p>
<p>There is a button that says:</p>

              <p>I’m sure all of this has been considered, but I stumbled on Discourse’s plugin page while I was looking for BBCode or Markdown explanations (never found it, the internet continues to be a complete mystery). Anyway, I thought these looked interesting (linked at the bottom).</p>
<p>The Slack integration might be great so that people could just post on the forum and the plugin would automatically spit it into Slack’s g_hangouts channel! Especially helpful for people who run games but may not have Slack access.<br>
The Perspectives API might be really helpful for the moderators, especially with its auto-flagging. Could also be overwhelming.<br>
And, while Google Translate isn’t amazing, a quick translate button might help expand the reach outside of English? Not a great solution, but could be helpful.</p>

              <p>Would there be any value in being able to add tags, like for games played, or games run, or games designed as a thing on the Gauntlet Forums and if so, where would be the best way to show or share that with others? I ask because I see this on other websites and I wonder how useful that is to connect people or not. Thoughts appreciated.</p>

              <p>Evening everyone, Ferrell here, speaking as part of the Mod Team and for the Mod Team of the Forums.</p>
<p>First off, apologies for letting <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/seeking-volunteers-for-moderator-team/4005/1">this thread</a> get completely out of control; until today none of us had been able to check back in and see things were getting out of hand, and we were trying to stay hands off until we all had some agreement on the text we wanted to post in response to everyone’s inquiries. Unfortunately, this lead to the original thread going away from a request for Volunteers and into a discussion of the issue before we had a chance to respond. We apologize for this and want to rectify the situation, so that thread has been locked but preserved, and it has been linked to this message, and this message linked back, so we can ensure full transparency, and avoid any implication that we are trying to bury or hide the problems that must be addressed.</p>
<p>The text we agreed upon up to this point is as follows:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In late June, the person responsible for the day-to-day running of the Gauntlet community spaces abused his power over a personal dispute and has since then stepped down from those responsibilities as well as stepping away from the community side of the Gauntlet entirely - namely, Slack and the gaming calendar - and hand the reigns over to Lowell. For more information, see these posts:<br>
<a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/these-games-i-love-part-two">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/these-games-i-love-part-two</a><br>
<a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-changes/2823" class="inline-onebox">Gauntlet Changes</a></p>
<p>Since Lowell has taken over, the Gauntlet Care Committee was formed and has been working to form a more concrete and agreed-upon Code of Conduct and while it’s been slow, issues are being addressed and worked through.</p>
<p>On November 9th, Shane locked down the forums into read-only mode and made a post (<a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-future-of-the-forums/3914/13">The Future of the Forums</a>) indicating his desire to step away from the Gauntlet over decisions made by “the management of the Gauntlet”.</p>
<p>Given that Shane set the forums up and was responsible for many of the resources required to maintain the forums, stepping away from the Gauntlet was a process that would include transitioning maintenance of the forums off to someone else. The lockdown of the forums came as a surprise as Shane didn’t let anyone know ahead of time that this was his plan. Shane provided a backup of the forums which was then used to set up a new environment for the forums to run in. That process was completed on November 10th.</p>
<p>In addition, we have had individuals decide to leave the message board for their own reasons. In the case of these moderator/admin team of these forums, the departures included Shane &amp; Joao (formerly admins) as well as Cass (formerly a moderator). Yoshi has also stepped down from the moderator team though he has indicated that he’ll still be around as a member of the forums.</p>
<p>Despite any disagreements or anything that’s happened, the moderator team would like to thank Shane, Joao, Cass, Yoshi, and for everything they’ve done in service of getting these forums up and maintaining them as a place for high quality discussion of TTRPGs and LARP play and design.</p>
<p>As the first sentence of the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy states,  <strong>“The Gauntlet strives to create an inclusive, safe, fun and engaging community for gamers of all kinds.”</strong>  That is still the goal of the remaining mod team and we’re dedicated to uphold those values. The only change anyone should notice from here on out is maybe a few new faces on the mod team.</p>
<p>We would now like to open this up for discussion and feedback. We want to stress that anything posted in this thread should still follow all guidelines (<a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/faq">https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/faq</a>) - we ask that you please be civil and constructive in your feedback. If you have any feedback that you don’t feel comfortable posting publicly, we encourage you to send a message directly to the mod team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still welcome your feedback and inquiries, but we will be heavily moderating this post to keep it on topic of looking for help being a moderator on this site.  Some comments on the post “Seeking volunteers for moderator team” have been moved here, as they better suit this topic. We will leave comments open on the <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/seeking-volunteers-for-moderator-team/4005/1">previous post</a> for 24 hours, and lock it on 12/3/2019 @ 8PM (GMT -6) so that people can have their say and ask questions, after which <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/seeking-volunteers-for-moderator-team/4005/1">that post</a> will be locked.</p>
<p>To go back to our original request, I will copy the former Opening Post below:<br>
Right now we have a skeleton crew of forum moderators helping out – we are looking to expand that team to make sure things continue to run smoothly here. We’d especially appreciate members of marginalized communities to help bring better perspective and more representation to this space, and to make the voices of PoC, disabled or non-cishet people heard clearer. Going forward we’re asking that moderators (and other volunteers) serve at most one year, to keep people from getting burned out and reduce exploitation.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in volunteering to help out, please contact <a class="mention" href="/u/sabinev5">@SabineV5</a> or <a class="mention" href="/u/robert">@Robert</a> and one of us will reach out to discuss further.<br>
Thank you to everybody for your participation in the forums and for what you do for this community.</p>

              <p>First: I’m not a mod.</p>
<p>I just notice that when someone starts a post with a negative<br>
“I don’t agree.”<br>
“That’s wrong.”<br>
“It doesn’t work like that.”<br>
That’s all language that asserts (a little) “I know better” / “I’m staking our a place of opposition.”</p>
<p>In my experience anything else in the post isn’t as likely to be useful, and it’s likelier that the thread details after. So I tend to breeze past those.</p>
<p>But what can you do?</p>
<p>Why not try<br>
“I’ve had a different experience…” (And say what it is!)<br>
“Why do you think that? Are you saying (restate as you understand it)”<br>
“It works like this: (and explain)</p>
<p>I just find a little positive phrasing goes a long way to convey that I’m  being constructive.</p>
