            <blockquote>
              <p>Open Hearth Gaming Community is working to provide a space for safe and exciting online TTRPG play. Emerging from the Gauntlet Gaming Community, this community has been organizing games since 2015. All sessions are run by volunteer game facilitators using a layered set of safety tools. Our calendar app allows for signup and waitlists for a variety of indie, trad, and story game RPGs. The community offers many other benefits including game facilitator workshops, podcasts, free online conventions, playtesting, a shared discussion space, seminars, and a Gameway program supporting marginalized gamers.</p>
<p>We are proud of all the community has done to develop a strong and vibrant play culture over the last few years… With community feedback, we remixed our code of conduct and put together a team to handle issues and complaints. We formalized the use of a layered set of safety tools built into every game run on our calendar. In 2020 when the lockdown began, community members asked what we could do to help onboard existing TTRPG players to playing online—not to recruit people for the community, but to help people set up their own games anywhere. That led to us organizing a half-dozen free Open Gaming conventions.</p>
<p>Work began on developing Open Hearth in 2022 when Gauntlet Publishing asked if we would spin off the community. A working group of community members came together to plan a new and independent version of the community. Over the next several months we worked with Jon Grim on Playabl, a new gaming calendar app. We’re excited to use and support further development of Playabl. It has several features lacking in our previous app, but more importantly, Jon hopes to make the app available to other TTRPG communities to organize events quickly and easily.</p>
<p>We’re excited by this new organization and the opportunities it offers us and Gauntlet Publishing to focus on our core strengths and missions. Gauntlet Publishing has had a run of success in recent years with projects like <em>Trophy</em>, <em>Brindlewood Bay</em>, and the forthcoming <em>Arkham Herald</em>. For Open Hearth Gaming, it allows us to focus on what’s most important to us, play: playing games, talking about play, proposing ideas for new games, discussing how we run, promoting a safe and inclusive play culture, hacking and playtesting, and supporting folks in joining the hobby.</p>
<p>Open Hearth will be supported by its own Patreon. Backers at the $4 level have a 48-hour window of priority access, but after that, sessions are open to anyone. We also offer sessions focused on new players to help them try out the community. Even if a game is full, players can always join a waitlist. Many games draw from those waitlists, and signing up for them is a great way to show that a game is in demand. Game facilitators run series using an open table policy, so players can sign up for anything from a single session to a whole campaign. Anyone who plays a session with us or supports our Patreon can join our Open Hearth Slack.</p>
<p>We also have a Gameway program supporting gamers from marginalized communities or those suffering financial hardship. We offer priority access free of charge to those persons. They can self-identify, and we don’t ask for an explanation or details. You can see more about the program here: <a href="https://openhearthgaming.com/gameway">openhearthgaming.com/gameway</a></p>
<p>For existing members, we will be using the <a href="https://app.playabl.io/communities/the_open_hearth">Open Hearth Playabl calendar</a>. Members already set up there don’t need to make any changes to their account. Event creators on the current Playabl calendar will keep that status.</p>
<p>To support the Open Hearth Gaming Community, gamers can join the Patreon. Joining at the $4 level or higher gets members RSVP priority access. We will not be downgrading anyone’s current status on the calendar before June 30th. Anyone currently set as a Supporter will keep that status until then, even if they don’t support either Patreon.</p>
<p>We will maintain the existing Gameway program and continue to support current participants. We will be checking in with existing members—or they can contact us at <a href="mailto:openhearthgamingcommunity@gmail.com">openhearthgamingcommunity@gmail.com</a>—to get set up. For anyone interested in joining this program, please feel free to contact us.</p>

              <p>So we held off posting this as we didn’t want to steal thunder from +1 Forward’s announcement of their final show. As you know we recently released the Gauntlet Podcast 2022 Game of the Year episode. It’s pretty amazing thanks to everyone who contributed, and especially to Rob for his great edit and organization. That episode will be the hosting team’s last.</p>
<p>It’s not the end of our work however. We’re working on a new podcast with some slight changes to the format and new brand identity. We really enjoy the basic structure of hosts talking with community members about what they’re playing and interested in. We want to broaden that a little and open it up for folks to talk about any games they’ve played. We have a few other tweaks as well.</p>
<p>One of the things we want to do is add a couple of new voices and increase the diversity of the team, so we’re going to be exploring how to do that. I personally want to thank hosts David, Rae, Shane, and Sherri for all their work. I also want to thank <a class="mention" href="/u/flatvurm">@flatvurm</a> (and <a class="mention" href="/u/richrogers">@RichRogers</a>) for their edits over the years. Rich brought me onto the show way back in 2016 and I took over managing the podcast in 2019. I’m really proud of what we’ve done-- both the general shows which have spotlighted tons of games as well as the focused episodes like our seminar on hard moves and our talk with Rich about editing podcasts.</p>
<p>We will have more news in the next couple of months-- and when we have our new feed, we’ll get that posted for everyone.</p>
<p>We want to thank everyone who has listened, has been on the show, and has given us feedback. This podcast has been as strong as it is because of the community.</p>

              <p>We’ve made a small change (long overdue) to the Forums, setting up a distinct channel for Gauntlet Publishing. This will be the place to discuss all Gauntlet Publishing games and releases: The Between, Brindlewood Bay, Trophy, Codex, etc. We’ll make sure to announce new things (like new issues of Codex) here.</p>
<p>You may notice some old topics popping up in the recent topics list; that’s because we moved a number of threads over there. We have a few other small clean up changes coming (like some better pinned messages with easier contact info). .</p>
