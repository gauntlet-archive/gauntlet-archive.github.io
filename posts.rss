        <title>Where are people going for indie RPG / story-game discussion now?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Froggy]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>So, if anyone‚Äôs still reading this, I‚Äôve launched it (a logo is incoming, but not ready yet). A warning: this is a project I‚Äôve had in mind for a while and it‚Äôs not meant as a replacement for The Gauntlet. It‚Äôs a different place with different goals.</p>
<p>The name of the forum is <strong>Wynwerod</strong>, an Old English word meaning a wandering troupe of musicians, literally a ‚Äúmerry band‚Äù. I‚Äôm referencing the metaphor, as popularised by Ron Edwards, of the play system as musical instruments, and of  <strong>the play group as sort of a jam session</strong> , with play/music as folk art for mutual enjoyment of the players‚Äîrather than a highly produced or rehearsed piece for an audience. I hope it gives a good impression of the values that I want to impart on this place.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs probably not going to be for everyone. What I‚Äôd like it to be is for  <em>anyone</em>  that shares its values and goals‚Äîbeyond their personal background or what roleplaying faction they self-identify with. Therefore, let me share with you the Wynwerod  <strong>agenda</strong> .</p>
<h1>Agenda</h1>
<p>The  <strong>goals</strong>  of Wynwerod are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reflect on and analyse</strong>  our own role-playing activity, to improve as players, engage authentically, and maximise our enjoyment and sense of purpose.</li>
<li>Act as an  <strong>international cultural crossroads</strong>  for role-players of any background or nationality.</li>
<li>
<strong>Archive</strong>  interesting material, or valuable conversations made on more ephemeral platforms.</li>
<li>Promote the  <strong>making of games</strong>  and play material, with the understanding that games can only get better as a by-product of great play.</li>
<li>
<strong>Discuss to find out</strong>  what others have to say.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this interests you, you‚Äôre welcome to make an account and introduce yourself here:</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><a class="mention" href="/u/jasoncordova">@jasoncordova</a>, if you were to issue a 301 redirect with rewrite rule from <code>forums.gauntlet-rpg.com</code> to <code>gauntlet-archive.github.io</code> when you close the forum, it would probably preserve the Google search ranking of many discussions here and transfer it to the archived version. It would help in preventing discussions getting lost in the internet memory hole.</p>
<p>This because the archived site has the same address structure as the current forums.</p>
<p>Please do consider it.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This seems to be on the roll. Let‚Äôs see if it comes together - spread the word to your friends!</p>
<p>The current idea is to focus on playing on purpose, improving our skills, and collecting the wisdom of the various online spaces where great discussions are happening in one place, where they can be stored indefinitely, linked to, shared, and built upon.</p>
<p>I made a giant summary of PbtA dicing techniques, for example, at La Locanda. I‚Äôll definitely make an English-language version of that for the new forum.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I‚Äôve been talking with <a class="mention" href="/u/paul_t">@Paul_T</a> of the possibility that I open an English-language Discourse space myself, inspired by the success of the italian <a href="https://forum.locandagdr.it" rel="nofollow noopener">La Locanda dei GDR</a> that I manage.</p>
<p>If I do, though, it‚Äôs not going to be a ‚Äústory games‚Äù forum or a replication of this one ‚Äì on La Locanda I‚Äôve tried to move beyond labels to encourage an eclectic style of play, with cross-pollination from different sources, and that‚Äôs probably the type of space that I‚Äôd want to set up.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested, send me a message, or an email at <a href="http://mailto:letsmakeaforum@froggyc.eu" rel="nofollow noopener">letsmakeaforum@froggyc.eu</a>, or contact Discord account <code>froggyc</code>.</p>
<p>P.S. I also highly recommend <a href="http://adeptplay.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Adept Play</a> if you‚Äôre interested in seriously improving your play. That place has helped me tremendously in the last few years.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@SeanGomes]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>When returning to UW2, I ended up taking a pretty big step back from my previous designs. I wanted to see if I could approach the same vibe, but questioning the mechanics and systems behind it. Interestingly, the further I strayed from the original design, the more I questioned certain mechanics, the more I started to get an uneasy ‚Äúbut is this Uncharted Worlds‚Äù feeling.</p>
<p>After multiple iterations, I ended up circling back to a lot of the design decisions that I made originally. Partly because they were indeed the more elegant/simple way of handling things, partly because massive overhauls felt like change for the sake of change, and partly because certain elements were central to the UW that folks enjoyed.</p>
<p>That said, one thing I am doing is changing the dice. I‚Äôll give you all a moment to collectively gasp.</p>
<p>The old 2d6: 6- | 7-9 | 10+ has served many a story game well, but the range limited stat bonuses, with each +1 disproportionately skewing the expected results. Additionally, I‚Äôve been very happy with the incorporation of Advantage/Disadvantage as a mechanic (Advantage: 3dice + drop lowest. Disadvantage: 3dice drop highest)</p>
<p>I‚Äôve crunched the numbers here and thought I‚Äôd share. Note that a 0 in this scale is the equivalent of a -1 in a 2d6 system; I just felt that starting the characters at 0 across the board and building them up as they chose origins and careers was more aesthetically pleasing than a downer ‚Äú-1‚Äù.</p>

</div><p>(For reference, an unmodified 2d6 is 41.6% fail, 41.7% mixed, 16.7% hit)</p>
<p>Of interesting note, a Balanced roll (2d10, no Advantage or Disadvantage) has a 50% chance for a mixed success / success-with-cost <em>no matter what your stat is</em>, which is quite fortuitous.</p>
<p>Obviously, I‚Äôm going to have to playtest the d10 version to make sure it still feels right, but I‚Äôm fairly confident that it will provide me with a few opportunities. (Not the least of which is randomized charts are so much easier to do in a d10 system! And UW has 10 origins and 10 careers, so there could even be a life-path-ish randomized character creation. Just spitballing)</p> ]]></description>

<p>Yeah, I trudged the same path. I learned a lot from the first game I published. I think it‚Äôs good to release a game as soon as possible, just to get it out of the way, and learn from that experience. So switching setting could be a good thing, if it‚Äôs a fantasy game that you really want to make.</p> ]]></description>

<p>More specifically, I think I need to figure out layout, and get lots of flashy art. No one (it feels like) wants to look at a block of text (even potental playtesters). But I think I need to make sure the game text is solid before I invest in such things.</p> ]]></description>

<p>You need clearer goals - when is it more polished and presentable? I‚Äôve read the first two pages, and they are well written, from what I can tell.

<p>Some more about me and my game.</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm a dude (he/him) in my 40s who started playing TTRPGs in my 30s.</li>
<li>I started working on the game out of my frustrations with other game systems.</li>
<li>It started as a mod for a popular game (bonus points if you can guess which), but I eventually swapped out everything with custom mechanics.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm extremely shy.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm just trying to do what I see in other books, but I don‚Äôt know anything about layouts or anything. Seriously, any advice or feedback is welcome!</li>
<li>The game started out as generic setting-less, then I decided to make it fantasy but hit a creativity wall, then decided to make it Cyberpunk and work on the fantasy version once the mechanics were tested.</li>
<li>I Still don‚Äôt know how much of a setting I want the game to have baked in, and how much should be up to the player. I‚Äôve heard this referred to as the goldilocks zone.</li>
<li>I feel if my game were more polished and presentable, I could easily find playtesters and collaborators in local communities, in the meantime I‚Äôm reaching out to game design enthusiasts on the interwebs.</li>
<li>The typical response I get when I ask anyone for help is ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be glad to, just don‚Äôt expect me to read anything.‚Äù</li>
<li>One of the core design philosophies is to have dice mechanics that are easy to read, with math that can be done by counting fingers, and odds that are somewhat reliable.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôm doing this right. Please let me know if I should edit or delete the post.</li>
<li>I know the forums are going away in a couple days but Discord really stresses me out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just by reading this post you have done more for my game than any of my friends, and I appreciate it.</p> ]]></description>
