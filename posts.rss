I even tried to enter some professionals courses and this was in vain. I always liked those apps where you can play casino games and even placing bets like melbet registration <a href="https://melbetonline.pk/registration/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://melbetonline.pk/registration/</a> and wanted to create something like this…always, maybe i need more time, who knows</p> ]]></description>

<p>I’m not quite sure about Reddit. That kind of posting doesn’t really encourage responses or discussion in a way that I can easily parse. I much prefer this forum-ish format here.</p>
<p>I’ve been checking out The Cauldron, which has a very similar format to this place. It seems pretty active and I’m getting a good vibe so far.</p>
<p>[Edit] Does anyone follow ttrpg designers on Mastodon? How does that work out? Is it mostly announcements “I’ll be at x convention” or “I’m running a kickstarter” or something like that?</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Uncharted Worlds 2nd Edition - Alpha</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@SeanGomes]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>When returning to UW2, I ended up taking a pretty big step back from my previous designs. I wanted to see if I could approach the same vibe, but questioning the mechanics and systems behind it. Interestingly, the further I strayed from the original design, the more I questioned certain mechanics, the more I started to get an uneasy “but is this Uncharted Worlds” feeling.</p>
<p>After multiple iterations, I ended up circling back to a lot of the design decisions that I made originally. Partly because they were indeed the more elegant/simple way of handling things, partly because massive overhauls felt like change for the sake of change, and partly because certain elements were central to the UW that folks enjoyed.</p>
<p>That said, one thing I am doing is changing the dice. I’ll give you all a moment to collectively gasp.</p>
<p>The old 2d6: 6- | 7-9 | 10+ has served many a story game well, but the range limited stat bonuses, with each +1 disproportionately skewing the expected results. Additionally, I’ve been very happy with the incorporation of Advantage/Disadvantage as a mechanic (Advantage: 3dice + drop lowest. Disadvantage: 3dice drop highest)</p>
<p>I’ve crunched the numbers here and thought I’d share. Note that a 0 in this scale is the equivalent of a -1 in a 2d6 system; I just felt that starting the characters at 0 across the board and building them up as they chose origins and careers was more aesthetically pleasing than a downer “-1”.</p>

</div><p>(For reference, an unmodified 2d6 is 41.6% fail, 41.7% mixed, 16.7% hit)</p>
<p>Of interesting note, a Balanced roll (2d10, no Advantage or Disadvantage) has a 50% chance for a mixed success / success-with-cost <em>no matter what your stat is</em>, which is quite fortuitous.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’m going to have to playtest the d10 version to make sure it still feels right, but I’m fairly confident that it will provide me with a few opportunities. (Not the least of which is randomized charts are so much easier to do in a d10 system! And UW has 10 origins and 10 careers, so there could even be a life-path-ish randomized character creation. Just spitballing)</p> ]]></description>

<p>Yeah, I trudged the same path. I learned a lot from the first game I published. I think it’s good to release a game as soon as possible, just to get it out of the way, and learn from that experience. So switching setting could be a good thing, if it’s a fantasy game that you really want to make.</p> ]]></description>

</aside>
<p>You need clearer goals - when is it more polished and presentable? I’ve read the first two pages, and they are well written, from what I can tell. When it comes to graphic design, I’ve written a <a href="https://www.erebaltor.se/rickard/typography/" rel="nofollow noopener">short manual</a>. You basically only need the first page, but the GDoc looks already better than most other amateur works (and some “professional” American games).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi all! I have written a playable prototype for a TTRPG but I’m struggling with having anyone take a look at it. My friends and family aren’t into TTRPGs and any acquaintances who happen to be just don’t have time for an unfinished game.</p>
<p>The prototype is available to download free on Itch but I’ve made several changes to the text in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Some more about me and my game.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a dude (he/him) in my 40s who started playing TTRPGs in my 30s.</li>
<li>I started working on the game out of my frustrations with other game systems.</li>
<li>It started as a mod for a popular game (bonus points if you can guess which), but I eventually swapped out everything with custom mechanics.</li>
<li>I’m extremely shy.</li>
<li>I’m just trying to do what I see in other books, but I don’t know anything about layouts or anything. Seriously, any advice or feedback is welcome!</li>
<li>The game started out as generic setting-less, then I decided to make it fantasy but hit a creativity wall, then decided to make it Cyberpunk and work on the fantasy version once the mechanics were tested.</li>
<li>I Still don’t know how much of a setting I want the game to have baked in, and how much should be up to the player. I’ve heard this referred to as the goldilocks zone.</li>
<li>I feel if my game were more polished and presentable, I could easily find playtesters and collaborators in local communities, in the meantime I’m reaching out to game design enthusiasts on the interwebs.</li>
<li>The typical response I get when I ask anyone for help is “I’d be glad to, just don’t expect me to read anything.”</li>
<li>One of the core design philosophies is to have dice mechanics that are easy to read, with math that can be done by counting fingers, and odds that are somewhat reliable.</li>
<li>I’m not even sure I’m doing this right. Please let me know if I should edit or delete the post.</li>
<li>I know the forums are going away in a couple days but Discord really stresses me out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just by reading this post you have done more for my game than any of my friends, and I appreciate it.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Harbingers - Wip of my soulslike entry to the Classic Explorer Workshop Jam</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@TheGiftOfGabes]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>For those not aware of the jam, here is the link: <a href="https://itch.io/jam/classic-explorer-workshop" rel="nofollow noopener">https://itch.io/jam/classic-explorer-workshop</a></p>
<p>I’m calling it Harbingers for now. What you’ll read below is the overarching plan of the game. Some of the mechanics and systems are already drafted and I’ll post them later.</p>
<p>I would appreciate y’all poking questions at the whole thing, offering advice and suggestions, and in general talking about what you would like in a game like this.</p>
<hr>
<h2>premise</h2>
<p>Grand Heroes save the world and now no one can die.</p>
<p>People are Undying but their souls Rot over time, until they are Unliving, mindless and obsessed.</p>
<p>A Gardener has preserved Seeds from the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>You are Harbingers, tasked by the Gardener to carry the remaining seeds to the place where the Tree of Life rotted, purge its dead Roots, and Sow the Seeds of Life, allowing all Unliving and Undying to finally pass on.</p>
<p>The world will perish and from its ashes new life may grow.</p>
<h2>create character</h2>
<h3>Choose a Title</h3>
<p>Your title represents your “class”. You pick all benefits associated.</p>
<p>Examples/tone</p>
<ul>
<li>deceiver</li>
<li>heretic</li>
<li>thief</li>
<li>charlatan</li>
<li>fool</li>
<li>betrayer</li>
<li>murderer</li>
</ul>
<p>Each allows the following categories of benefits (tbd)</p>
<ul>
<li>delving</li>
<li>journeying</li>
<li>surviving</li>
<li>solo skill</li>
<li>team skill</li>
<li>bargaining</li>
</ul>
<h3>Starting Qualities</h3>
<p>All start at 10.</p>
<p>Testing a Quality: roll 1d6. Spend as many d6 from your personal pool as you want.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#todo</span></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] pool: hope, it’s finite but can be replenished</li>
<li>[ ] pool: start at 1d6 per rank</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rank</h3>
<p>Starting Rank is 1.</p>
<p>Every pick from the options below has a rank requirement. You can pick and keep as many things as you want as long as their total requirement is equal or below your Rank.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#todo</span></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] how do you increase rank?</li>
<li>[ ] encounters equal a sum of everyone’s ranks? Average? Highest?</li>
<li>[ ] is rank individual or for the whole group?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choose a Memento</h3>
<p>A memento represents another aspect of your past and let’s you choose a single benefit from a second class.</p>
<p>The first one is free.</p>
<h3>Equipment &amp; Magic</h3>
<p>List of items you can pick with a Rank requirement.</p>
<h2>create haven</h2>
<p>A settlement with a Bonfire and a few key individuals.</p>
<p>Procedure for its creation. Draw a map or write a description.</p>
<p>Some NPCs come here after you find them.</p>
<h2>Journey</h2>
<p>When you set out, start drawing a map. Roll on the hew map for next location.</p>
<p>Describe it according to procedure.</p>
<p>When you roll doubles, there is a complication there.</p>
<p>Resolve the encounter, draw the map and move on.</p>
<h2>Delving</h2>
<p>When you enter locations 14 and 16, you enter a Delve.</p>
<p>Choose a Theme and a Domain. Describe what the first impression of the Delve is and name it.</p>
<p>Roll 2d6 on the Ladder table to define the next site. Use dice of different colours, one lighter and one darker. Keep the lowest result.</p>
<p>The lighter die moves you towards the top of the table, the darker die moves you towards the bottom.</p>
<p>If you roll past the top, return to the Bonfire. Decide if it’s the same from before or a new one. If you roll past the bottom, return to the Guardian of the Delve.</p>
<p>Doubles spell trouble. Remain where you are and resolve it.</p>
<p>Once you deal with the Guardian of the Delve, keep going until you roll past the top or the bottom.</p>
<p>Botrom: Connect the exit of the Delve to the next hex on the Journey.</p>
<p>Top: move straight to Hex 19 and start a Heroic Delve.</p>
<h2>surviving</h2>
<p>Blackjack style dice minigame.</p>
<p>Roll higher than the opponent t without rolling over 12.</p>
<p>Hitting, standing, and other default blackjack moves reskinned to fit the theme, plus a few moves added.</p>
<h2>dying</h2>
<p>When a solo character dies or the whole group dies, return to a previous bonfire.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] what happens when characters backtrack?</li>
<li>[ ] what do they lose when they die?</li>
<li>[ ] what and how will they regain it?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Heroic Delve</h2>
<p>In most aspects, identical to the regular delve, with these differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hero: a unique boss</li>
<li>increase the Harbingers rank at the end</li>
<li>earn Heroic Curse at the end</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag">#todo</span></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] determine further differences and similarities</li>
</ul>
<h2>King of Heroes</h2>
<p>The final Hero.</p>
<p>Procedures to create the King of Heroes.</p>
<p>Defeat the King of Heroes and delve into the Rotten Tree.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#todo</span></p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] detail the conclusion</li>
</ul>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>For me, it’s an “is there interest?” thing.</p>
<p>Our stance has been that all games where you make fiction are RPGs. Not necessarily in a genre sense, but because we want to embrace games that push the boundaries of the medium.</p>
<p>All that in mind I think we could set up a storygame subforum for communities who need it. The mods and I would have to sort out what goes where, but that’s not too big a deal.</p>
<p>Like Christopher, I’m interested in welcoming new designs and experiments. Right now, our game design forum is only lightly populated and designers tend to post their stuff in our Tabletop Roleplaying Open forum. I like that trend, but if we could make the design forum more useful and visible, that would be great, too.</p>
<p>To be a bit blunter and more personal, I’ve lost forums I was a part of, too. Servers are costy and modding is hard.</p>
<p>But I’ve been a poster on RPGnet for more than 20 years, and we have a measure of stability. I’ll gladly offer the benefits of that stability and staying power to anyone here who needs it.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Well, I hardly speak for the community here as a whole (<img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">) , but I think there are likely a bunch of people here who would be happy to have a forum that is a discussion space for “story games”. Traditionally, story game discussion seems to have worked well when there was a carved-out space of some sort that people felt safe in. What that might look like over at RPGnet is up for debate I suppose? What options would there be at RPGnet? E.g would a subforum be in line with common RPGnet decorum?</p> ]]></description>
