You&#39;ve read all the hype about Gauntlet Con 2019, and now you want to know how to get into the con?

The con is free to anyone who backs the [Gauntlet Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gauntlet/overview) at the $2 or higher level. To get signed up for the con before registration starts on Sept. 28, sign up for [Gauntlet Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gauntlet/overview) by Sept. 23! Anyone who signs up for the Patreon by Sept. 23 will be invited to register for the convention at no additional cost, just in time for the Sept. 28 registration opening.

In early October, after registration has started, we&#39;ll open up a PayPal link that allows attendees to pay for the con with a 1-time contribution of $10.

Volunteers, panelists, GMs, and guests also get free admission to the con, so if you&#39;re short on cast, you can get in touch with me or @yoshi about our [call for diverse GMs](https://discourse.funtimers.club/t/gauntlet-con-seeking-diverse-gms/3088) or checking with me or @flatvurm about helping with Gauntlet Con helpdesk or admin support.</description>
