              <p><strong>Against the Dark Conspiracy (3/3)</strong><br>
The team follow clues about “Mistress” to Bucharest where Matthew (the former CIA Provocateur) has a heart to heart with his Uncle Aurel on family history and obligations; Nadia (the Hacker) tracks a car number plate to one of the less salubrious districts of the city where Minder Two (former MI6 Scalp Hunter) stakes out a VERY select Spa with a Graeco-Roman theme.  Meanwhile, Victoria (the Handler) confirms Misstress is the Countess Galina Sofia Federovna who was 30 when she bought out some Soviet utilities in the 90’s … the regular appointments at the Spa must be keeping her VERY well preserved.<br>
There’s a visit by a cosmotology expert with a case full of ‘samples’, a janitor who looks good in a short toga with more than a mop in their trolley, a new spa member and her PA who ‘handles’ front of house security … then a secure ‘Emperor Suite’, Uncle Aurel in trouble, the traitorous Minder One, and a literal Blood Bath …</p>

              <p>Nadine (the German Hacker) digs up some dirt on the captured Dr Markov while ‘Two’ (the British Scalp Hunter) softens him up. Together they give Matthew (the American Provocateur) the leverage he needs to get solid leads that take the team to Berlin.  There they investigate Dr Markov’s charity, discover there’s something going on in the basement of a non-descript suburban office building, and plan the Operation … then there’s a subterranean ‘hospital’, ‘unusual’ treatment regimes, and … Ghouls.</p>

There’s some disappearances, a low rent West End '80s-themed night club with an unusual link to a homlessness charity, and a fat bloke in a white suit and gold chain heading for the toilet … then … a surprisingly slim bloke in a white suit emerging from the toilets, chaos on the dance floor, a trapped office door, and a Conspiracy pseudo-scientist who isn’t quite the push-over he appeared to be …</p>
