    <description>![The%20Giant&#39;s%20Carcass|446x446](upload://oTOTpcCGWZO0nAYv7wZIrpuT4pz.jpeg) 

This is a one-shot Trophy game testing a playset of my own: The Giant&#39;s Carcass. Once, there lived an extremely powerful wizard who became large as a mountain with power. The gods cast the wizard down, yet rumours remain that within the Carcass, powerfull Sigils are hidden, ripe for the taking by those who would dare. The player character are such people, seeking entrance through the Wound in the Giant&#39;s side, hoping to reach the heart for glory, riches or immortality!

Be advised that Trophy is a horror game based on Cthulhu Dark. It is a game about people ending up mad, or dead, or worse. The X-Card safety tool will be on the table, as will be lines and veils. For more information on the Gauntlet&#39;s safety tools, please refer to our Inclusivity Policy on the website (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html ).
