    <title>Trophy Writing Contest - Read the Entries!</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/trophy-writing-contest-read-the-entries/3591</link>
    <description>The submission deadline for the Trophy incursion-writing contest has passed. We received a whopping 50 entries! 

The next step for the contest is for @jesseross and I to read each entry and discuss them. We will announce the winner and runners-up during Gauntlet Con 2019 (October 24th-27th). 

Below is a link to a folder with all the entries so you can read them, discuss them, and play them. 

Some rules for this thread:

1. Keep it positive. This contest was meant to be a fun, creative exercise. Being unnecessarily harsh or critical isn&#39;t called for in this space. If you have a criticism of a particular piece, consider framing it as a question, such as: &quot;A question I have about this incursion is why did the author do XYZ in Ring 3?&quot; 

2. If you participated in the contest, feel free to identify yourself and which of the entries is yours. The judges will not be reading this thread. This is a space where you can discuss the contest freely. 

3. If you would prefer your entry not appear in the public folder, just send us an email to gauntletpublish at gmail. We&#39;ll remove it. 

4. If you don&#39;t see your entry in the list below or in the folder, email us. Your entry may have just got lost in the Google Drive shuffle or your submission email went to spam. 

With all that said, here is the list of incursions:

              <p>Glad to see you liked A Prestigious Affair. I’m glad I’m not the only one who finds parties creepy. I realized too late that it was more than just a modern horror story: I was writing satire. With some time and motivation, I might revise it again to bring out the satirical elements further.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the gift of letting me read your words. It can be a really scary thing to create art, to make something and put it out in the world for judgement. I just want to commend you all for your hard work, your craft, and your courage.</p>
<p>More to come, but for now, thank you and congratulations to all of you. I’m in awe.</p>

              <p>Thanks so much for doing this. Contest entries often feel like they disappear into the dark but getting a mini-review of each trophy module has been super fun and now I know a lot about all the entries being judged! I hope you collect these reviews in a blog post too or similar. It’s a great reference for anyone wanting to run some trophy sessions. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Writer of “oil” here, thank you kindly. Haven’t posted much, new to the community of this contest and always feel a little intimidated by active online forums, even if they are very positive.</p>
<p>I ran oil three times, each with groups of two with one person that played oil twice. It was all their first time with trophy or even a game of this nature and three of them hadnt really played RPGs before except a little d&amp;d. I found it really brought out the most in them and I had some of the most active and engaged players I’ve ever had because of the way the game asks the players to be complicit in their own downfall. It was really awesome. Granted, none of them were strict grid &amp; combat style RPG players, but I definitely had some of the most success with trophy in bringing players out of their shells. I think it was because they developed a greater sense of attachment to the character (because of in-play evolving backstory) at the same time as their character became more doomed (which they had a hand it). Something about knowing the end point (or at least that it was bad) but developing the character in spite of it really brought out some of the best rp in my players.</p>
<p>I love the other incursions I’ve read so far, I can’t wait to play them. The next one I’m writing is about early Basque whaling and I’m super pumped.</p>
