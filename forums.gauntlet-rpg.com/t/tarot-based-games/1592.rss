    <title>Tarot-based games?</title>

    <description>I saw a couple of them here:

[Alas, Vegas](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/199713/Alas-Vegas): A wild Vegas story.  I don&#39;t really know the details of what it uses Tarot for though, would love if someone could explain this in more depth.

Dylan, have you checked out *Alas, Vegas* ? It’s all that, using Tarot cards.

[Spindlewheel](https://www.teacabbage.com/spindlewheel): Less an RPG and more an informed narrative engine, it sounds like:
[quote=&quot;sidekickmachine, post:17, topic:419&quot;]
It uses the same format as a tarot reading, in that gameplay is pretty much focused on free-associating a story out of the themes of the cards and their placement in the spread. It has a unique rhythm to it that’s really refreshing.
[/quote]

Are there any other games like this?  I&#39;d really love to see more ideas about using tarot for:

- event resolution
- character definition
- Tarot-as-GM</description>

<p>There are a couple different flavors of the game. You can play a super straightforward version of the game with a regular deck of 52 playing cards. I liked it so much that I actually went out and bought a deck of tarot cards just to play the full version of the game, which was much more engaging and strategic. There are a custom suite of cards you can purchase and add to play an advanced version of the game that I haven’t tried that.</p>

              <p>There’s a Brazilian card-based pbta game called Aventuras Ancestrais that started with some kind of Tarot before they started drawing their own cards. It’s based on Northwestern folklore and the illustrations emulate cave paintings that are found in the area.</p>
<p>The cards in the player’s hands function as archetypes (classes) and items, but if they’re on the central stack, they are like dice. I don’t really remember all the rules, but the suits are stats, and you resolve conflict pulling a number of cards equal to your stat’s value. The number on the last card you pulled works just like a dice result in pbta and the illustrations are catalysts for the fiction that follows.</p>
<p>The system is neat, they actually adapted it for regular playing cards and it’s called Trama Cards now. Recently, the designers funded a slasher game based on it. If there’s interest (and assuming you could understand my English), I can consult the rules and give more details.</p>

Players draw five cards when each Chapter begins and use three as story hooks. The chosen cards’ readings are mixed with each other to come up with a Chapter’s starting points.</p>
<p>In a way, the tarot is used to replace the GM’s role as the person who comes up with story hooks. I kinda like how it does its own thing!</p>

              <p>I am developing a story game/ campaign development tool called <em>Decuma</em>. In Roman mythology, Decuma is the Fate tasked with allotting a mortal’s thread of life.</p>
<p>(Special thanks to all the members of the Gauntlet community who have been helping, encouraging and testing for me! &lt;3)</p>
<p>Imagine if PBTA character connections, A Quiet Year, and For The Queen had a gothic baby who liked tarot… that is Decuma! The game is a tool that facilitates collaborative world-building and character connections using tarot cards. It is effectively a game-before-the-game and gives your PCs the threads of life that you can weave into your campaign! Decuma works in conjunction with any RPG system, from D&amp;D or Savage Worlds to PBTA and FATE! After playing, you end up with a fully developed location, backstories and connections for the PCs, and NPCs/situations that the GM can use. Best of all, everyone understands and is invested in the world that you create together!</p>
<p>Being a tarot nerd, the wold creation questions are connected to the actual meaning of each tarot card. Just like a tarot reading, the way the card faces (called reversals) also change the meaning/question that you answer on the card. It’s heavily tied into the concept of tarot and reading the fate of your characters, but without taking away agency or creativity from the players/group.</p>
<p>I’ve been play testing it now for a few months and it has gone well. If you’d like more information or updates you can visit <a href="http://goldenlassogames.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">goldenlassogames.com</a> and join the mailing list.</p>
