    <description>I have posted the fourth entry in my Design Diary blog series for The Between. This one focuses on some of the changes being made from alpha to beta, and includes links to the first beta playtest session plus some of the new play materials.

              <p>I think you are right - there is also something about it reinforcing the dramatic tension that when you are acting under a threat if you roll a miss then things will get a whole lot worse.  In a horror (or an action oriented game) that makes for some super tense times.</p>

              <p>This is actually a pretty good point. In horror players are often reactive rather than active. I love how with PbtA games you can get such a feel just by the choice of moves.</p>

              <p>I think it might be down to the fact that it has horror elements? A horror PbtA game wants some kind of “stand your ground” or “don’t lose your nerve” kind of thing, I find. Could be a similar thing with Bite Me!.</p>

              <p>This all sounds great! I’m always in favour of ditching Harm (and iirc when I played before you were already trialling this?) Tweaking the assets sounds like a good call. And I love the sound of the chjanges to personal quarters. I love those little “house building” touches in games! Super excited to play in April, and eager to try my hand at running it when the rules are ready for release <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=6" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"></p>

              <p>I’m really interested that you mention you had to make a fix due to not having a “Act Under Pressure” or “Keep Your Cool” move.  I had the same thing in my PbtA game and ended up adding a similar(ish) move in one of the last iterations.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to the Beta game!</p>
