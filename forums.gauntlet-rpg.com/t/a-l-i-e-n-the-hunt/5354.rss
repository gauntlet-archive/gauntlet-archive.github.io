    <description>Note: For the first 24 hours (until June 2nd at 8 pm EST), Please only RSVP if you are based outside the continental US.

The all access time for this game is June 4th at 8 pm EST.

Peter Weyland V may be the richest man to ever live. As the CEO of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation he has access to all the riches of human space. One of his most prized possessions is the private hunting moon of Nublar. Weyland is known to spend vast fortunes to find, capture, and transport the most dangerous game to this moon so that he and his associates can hunt down and kill them.

After several weeks in cryosleep, you’ve arrived at Nublar, on the edge of known space. Why were you invited and what will happen now that you’re here? Let’s find out!

Here are five sessions of the ALIEN role playing game by Free League Publishing.

In ALIEN you play in a universe of body horror and corporate brinkmanship, where synthetic people play god while space truckers and marines serve host to newborn ghoulish creatures. It’s a harsh and unforgiving universe and you are nothing if not expendable.

CONTENT WARNING: ALIEN is a survival horror game. This may not be the game for you if you are sensitive to themes of body horror, extreme violence, sudden character death, and PvP conflict. We&#39;ll use communication and consent tools including the X-Card, Lines/Veils, and the Open Door to help everyone have a scary fun time, but please keep the contents and premise in mind.

This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. We will use Streamyard and Roll20 to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.

I am reserving a seat for Alun R and Will H.
