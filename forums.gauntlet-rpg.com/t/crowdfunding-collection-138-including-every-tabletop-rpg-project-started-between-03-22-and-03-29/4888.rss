    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/03/29/crowdfunding-collection-138/&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #138, including every tabletop rpg project started between 03/22 and 03/29&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This week around there are not that many projects, though the one around are quite interesting, thus let’s get to it.

First there is &lt;B&gt;Fading Suns: Pax Alexius&lt;/B&gt; offering a new edition of the popular roleplaying game. The project of Ulisses Games does not only offer the corebook, but about over a dozen sourcebooks for the colorful setting and game. I recommend having a look if you like the previous edition or are looking for an science fiction/fantasy game. &lt;B&gt;Gunship&lt;/B&gt; is another Science Fiction game, though focused on Space Western. The project offers a look onto the d20 system it uses (for free) and I think the project might be well worth it. Then there’s &lt;B&gt;Teenage Wasteland&lt;/B&gt;. A Powered by the Apocalypse game, in which kids got to brave a post-apocalyptic wastelands. The project is interesting enough, though it has a flexible funding goal.
If you are up for a German language game, you should take a look at &lt;B&gt;Scherbenfresser&lt;/B&gt;. It’s a storytelling game with a horror focus and I think it offers a quite interesting setting.
Though you might like to check out a gamebook like &lt;B&gt;Retro Quest&lt;/B&gt;, it’s just 100 pages but looks quite solid. I consider the &lt;B&gt;Teacher-Gamer Handbook&lt;/B&gt; more than solid. It offers a way to integrate tabletop games to teach life skills. I am no teacher myself, though I do consider it intruiging and recommend having a look.
There are of course more projects, like the &lt;B&gt;CAPERS Offworld RPG&lt;/B&gt; sourcebook for the Capers RPG. It offers alien, space action, space cops &amp; robbers with a 20s Science Fiction twist and I got an eye on it. There are interesting adventures like &lt;B&gt;Tails of the City&lt;/B&gt; for PFRPG or the nifty looking &lt;B&gt;Elite Metal Dice&lt;/B&gt;.
You’ll find those and more projects over here:
