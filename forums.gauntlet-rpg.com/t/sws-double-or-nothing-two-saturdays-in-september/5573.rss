*Double or Nothing* is a roleplaying game for 2 players (and one GM), in which you take the role of a pair of agents who get involved in over the top disasters and have to shoot, kick, and flirt their way out, hopefully without creating too much collateral damage along the way. It is heavily based on Dirty Pair and replicates the style and absurdity of the anime with a variety of simple and quick mechanics that will quickly lead to ever-escalating danger and a corresponding bill for damages.

This RPG is snappy to play and guaranteed to be ridiculous. Custom mechanics include flirting with one another for bonuses, tracking collateral damage in large monetary units, and actually, straight-up playing Truth or Dare with each other.

We&#39;re setting this game on Corellia, because it&#39;s dirty and corporation-controlled. You and your partner will work for a business alliance trying to prevent disasters that might crash the space stock market.
