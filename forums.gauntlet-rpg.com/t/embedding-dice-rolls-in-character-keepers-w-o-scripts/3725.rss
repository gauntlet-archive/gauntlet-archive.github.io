    <title>Embedding Dice Rolls in Character Keepers (w/o scripts)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/embedding-dice-rolls-in-character-keepers-w-o-scripts/3725</link>
    <description>I wanted a way to embed rolls in a character keeper becuase I like having every thing I need to play in a single tab.  However, the warning label that comes up in google sheets if you use custom scripts looks off-putting.  After a bit of experimenting, I found I way to simulate and display dice rolls right in Google Sheets.

Here&#39;s the result of my efforts (You need to make a copy of the sheet to use the rollers):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f2XwzW1SF72prsNp7JAG-GopbAFnmQ5rqaR5WVl2vhc/edit?usp=sharing

The examples are for common dice systems, but they could be adapted to other systems quite quickly. I&#39;d love to hear what people think and if there are other examples that would be useful.</description>

              <p>So I think there is a way for a script free, cross-users-consistent dice roller in Spreadsheets and that is through pre-generated random tables. They can be hidden and locked in a separate tab (and c’mon who wants to cheat anyway). You then just need to create a starting point in the random table at the beginning of the session and could from then on implement it in such a way that each roll reveals the next random number from the table.</p>
<p>If I have time later today, I will sit down to write it.</p>
<p>Which brings me again to a long term project of mine: RPG-session tension arc tweaked random series. The idea is that some random series are more beautiful than others when it comes to a gaming session. We have respect for randomness and enjoy the chaos produced from unexpected hits and misses. However, we all know from moments of frustration for example from this one session where there were no misses or the PbtA session where the GM was swamped in a pile of Hard Moves which brought everything to collapse.</p>
<p>The idea is then to design finite random tables which respect important metrics like Average and Variance but follow our gut feel about ‘good randomness’.</p>
<p>My background on this is a Master in Mathematics (Stochastic) but with a separate degree in Philosophy of Science and specifically the history of the theory of randomness. So I have been interested in stuff like this already for a long time.</p>

              <p>Using the checkbox feature for this is an amazing idea, <a class="mention" href="/u/michael">@Michael</a>. Before what I had done was creating a dropdown menu where you would switch from rolling to not rolling. That was just too much effort and not really intuitive.</p>
<p>Yeah, <a class="mention" href="/u/richrogers">@RichRogers</a>, some nice macros would be even better and Michael has actually done that, too. However, many players in my experience don’t want to give the spreadsheet the permissions necessary for run code.</p>
<p>I really like your idea, <a class="mention" href="/u/curubethion">@Curubethion</a>, about putting the checkbox next to the Stats and then roll+Stat automatically. That should be doable.</p>
<p>Personally, I would only use the simplest of all implementations with just 2d6 being rolled and all bonuses and modifications being added manually - just as most people do it in RFYP (rollforyour.party).</p>
