    <title>Academy of the Blade (Nov)</title>

    <description>This is for five sessions of *Academy of the Blade* a stretch goal setting for *Hearts of Wulin* inspired by *Revolutionary Girl Utena* and many other mysterious school manga and anime. These will be Sundays at 9AM Eastern in November. You are students at a school where you must navigate plots, cliques, academics, heartbreak, and mysterious duels. Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged, but not required. One seat is being held for a guest. CW: violence, romance, betrayal.

General RSVPs Open 11/14 

*At the Academy Passerine, nothing is more important than the duels. Governed by the Academy’s bizarre dream-logic, a single duel can mean the difference between glory and irrelevance. When each fighter enters the arena, they prick their finger with the spindle attached to every student’s uniform belt, their signature weapon forming outward from that single drop of blood, and prepare to attack without restraint. They can’t die in a duel, after all — the Academy doesn’t like letting its children go.*

*The higher your dueling rank is, the more power you have. If you’re strong enough, you can win yourself a nicer dorm room, a tailored uniform, freshmen scurrying out of your way if you even so much as glance in their direction. There’s a rumor that if the Champion stays undefeated for long enough, they can change anything-- from the walls of the Academy to their own heart.*

Each session will run up to 3 hours. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. We will use Zoom for our sessions. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
