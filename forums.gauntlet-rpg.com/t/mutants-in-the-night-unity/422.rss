The session is scheduled for 3 hours. The session will be recorded. 

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Unity Heights was a high tech, sleek neighborhood for the many &quot;young professionals&quot; working for the new headquarters of the shipping megacorp in the city. It was much celebrated, a seed of hope and renewal for the city. 

That was 24 years ago. The seed? Corrupted. 

Today, Unity Mutant Safe Zone are where the unwanted, the exploited, the acceptable target. The world is dying, the megacorp has changed headquarters again but still profits from exploitation of the inhabitants of Unity - perhaps even more as they are not even recognized as humans. The world crumbles away as capitalism keeps chugging along. You are mutants, the scapegoats for a crumbling system, blamed for everything; but you also have the tools to fix your communities and save your loved ones. As they fear you, they admit to the power for change your can wield. 

The soil is ready and toiled; make Unity a true seed. Bloom. 

This game abides by the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy. The X-Card and Lines&amp;Veils will be in use as well as any other safety tool players deem necessary. The world of Mutants in the Night is very dehumanizing - in a way that mirrors modern real world social dynamics. So please, be very forthcoming with Lines and Veils and the X-Card.
