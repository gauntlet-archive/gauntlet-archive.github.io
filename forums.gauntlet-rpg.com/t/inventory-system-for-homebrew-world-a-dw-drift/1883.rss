    <title>Inventory System for Homebrew World (a DW drift)</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve been working on and off on [Homebrew World](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/homebrew-world.html), my pared-down and significantly revised playset for Dungeon World.  I recently did a significant update to the Inventory System, borrowing heavily from Blades in the Dark.  [Full details here](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2019/04/homebrew-world-updates-v14-new-gear.html), but you can get most of the gist from this:
![image|625x499](upload://2mR2MqtwlRXm3tUawulNXjuE3EK.png) 

Initial reactions from people seeing it are good... the core idea is that you pick your Load; your Load determine how many &quot;slots&quot; (diamonds) of items you get, and you pick items at start of play or during play as you want. So far so good.

The problem that I was worried about, and that became clear on first playtest, is how this interacts with PCs using stuff up, dropping/losing items, adding items that they loot, and swapping gear between them. The &quot;diamonds&quot; from a player&#39;s Load are doing double duty as both an encumbrance limit and as a resource to expend, and when they start moving stuff around, it gets weird.  

E.g. the Fighter (shown above) starts play with a Normal Load (5 []s).  He starts with sword, a leather cuirass, and a shield (4 []s). During play, he produces a rope (his last []), ties it to a pillar, and then the party climbs down the rope, leaving it behind. He crosses off the rope or erases it, because he doesn&#39;t have it anymore.

The Fighter now has 4 []s marked, but has used all 5 []s to start with/produce items. The sheet/rules seem to imply that he can now produce another 1 [] item, because his Load is &quot;up to 5x []&quot; and he only has 4 [] on his sheet.  But that&#39;s not how it should work... he should be able to *pick up* another item that he finds, but he&#39;s already produced that rope he was carrying around and discarded it... he doesn&#39;t have another undefined 1 [] item, because if he did, he would have had 6 []s at one more... more than his Load allows.

Obviously, we could handwave it, but... I don&#39;t want to.  And initial playtest reports have already confirmed that this is a point of confusion/clarification.

I&#39;m pretty committed (for now, at least), in keeping:
1) The decision of &quot;how much Load are you carrying&quot; at the beginning of play
2) The ability to define gear both up front and on the fly
3) Listing the most relevant/interesting gear choices on the sheet itself (as opposed to just using slots and having players write in items on their slots)

So, with that in mind, here are 3 possible UI changes for the sheets (and the moves that go with them).  Interested in which ones y&#39;all think are most intuitive/easiest to use in play (or if you have suggestions for something better, keeping with the 3 commitments above):

**Option A**:  adding empty diamonds next each Load option, and you mark those at the same time start w/produce items in play:
![image|548x500](upload://aF1ciebgbmYwjk3q6OcuElh7xgm.png) 

**Option B**:  adding empty circles (which are used throughout to denote uses or resources that can be accumulated/spent), with instructions to mark them as items are picked/produced.
![image|548x500](upload://tyr8s8LWUVUm5vo9PbCTX2ctNwK.png) 

**Option C**:  adding a new icon (combo of circles+diamonds) to specifically denote undefined resources, with instructions to mark them as items are defined.
