This is a new webcomic romance ttrpg I&#39;m playtesting through the Gauntlet. Notes for previous playtesters, I have made significant changes to the game from the last playtest so please feel welcome to play again.

*She’s young, single and about to achieve her dream of creating incredible videogames. But then life throws her a one-two punch: a popular streamer gives her first game a scathing review. Even worse she finds out that same troublesome critic is now her new neighbor! A funny, sexy and all-too-real story about gaming, memes, and social anxiety. Come for the plot, stay for the doggo.* 

That&#39;s the premise of &#39;Let&#39;s Play&#39; a popular webcomic on Webtoon. I fell in love with the strip and, with it being on hiatus for good few months, am looking to release a fangame ttrpg to share with other fans so they can have a little fun playing &#39;What if...&#39; As a romance webcomic, I&#39;m hoping that a few fans will pick it up and get a taste of roleplaying.



This is a structured freeform game; very simply the main character, Sam, has a series of - increasingly romantic - interactions with her love interests. At the end, there&#39;s a simple mechanic to determine which character has captured her heart and they&#39;ll decide whether they and Sam have a future together.

You do not need to have any prior knowledge of the webcomic as I&#39;ll describe all the available characters at the start.

Note that, while the attached image shows Sam with her three main romantic interests from the comic, there are many other characters available and I am supportive of Sam being romanced by characters of any gender.

Technical details
Note that this game will be played over streamyard and the audio (not the video) may be used to make an actual play to promote the game. I am happy to make edits at players&#39; request though.

Safety tools
This sessions will use:
- a content &#39;palette&#39; incorporating Lines &amp; Veils
- X-Card
- active check-ins where requested

These session will follow The Gauntlet’s Code of Conduct.
