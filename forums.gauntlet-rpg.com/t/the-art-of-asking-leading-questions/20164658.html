<p>We all play in our bubbles. Gauntlet players will have a high ‚Äúnarrative inteligence,‚Äù but not all groups will have that. I encountered players who come from a very trad approach with an antagonistic GM and they feel threathened when you start declaring stuff about the only thing they can control in the game world. So I have put it in the original post as a fail safe. I will edit that post to make it more clear <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <p>If you have trad players, can‚Äôt you start out with leading questions that <em>grant them agency</em> traditionally reserved for GMs? Let them declare facts about the environment and the world at large for a bit before you ask questions that push on their agency over their PC.</p>

          <p>You sure can!</p>
<p>I just chose the above approach based on my group, but each group and each player will be different. For me this was the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù way of getting them familiar with such narrative game approach. Start will small details, build upwards.</p>
<p>Some of my players were not comfortable breaking the traditional GM/Player split, so I chose to just build up slowly for everyone, so no one feels left out. It worked for our group, you might find a different approach works for you <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think I should have specified that my advice was just that - advice. You might need to tweak it, so it works with your group <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, establishing questions are a really wonderful way to figure out a leading question to ask. ‚ÄúIs your mother dead?‚Äù is a great question, but it‚Äôs not a leading question. If the PC is in a mansion owned by someone they‚Äôre trying to convince to something (funding a quest, freeing a prisoner, whatever), you might ask ‚Äúas you‚Äôre waiting in the sitting room, what on the mantle over the fireplace reminds you of your dead mother?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, in that case, I‚Äôm not into leading questions at all, mostly because there is no way of structuring them. You can go from from small things to ridiculous large ideas:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTell me why the world is falling apart?‚Äù<br>
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTell me something about what you character discovered about particle mass‚Äù<br>
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTell me your point of view of the correlation between lebens raum and today‚Äôs right wing movement.‚Äù</p>
<p>The OP should had been asked in that case: ‚Äúwhy are we asking leading questions?‚Äù</p>
<p>For me, I have a playstyle where the players can make up pretty anything, as long as it makes sense (given the setting and situation; which the group have agreed upon), and I have techniques to make them comfortable in having a larger influence than just their character. I also play a lot of <em>collaborative storytelling</em>, and when someone is describing ‚Äì for example ‚Äì the surroundings when setting a scene, I can ask them ‚ÄúHas it rained?‚Äù. I pretty much wants it to rain, but I have had people saying ‚ÄúNo, but it‚Äôs snowing‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs actually quite sunny‚Äù and having them taking a stand. Either way will satisfy me.</p>
<p>I do ask leading questions like yours if it‚Äôs during character creation. It‚Äôs basically trying to hook the players into something interesting. If they don‚Äôt bite, I leave it at that. My biggest concern, however, is that your ‚Äúmum portrait‚Äù example is forcing the player to make it interesting, because you do that while playing. That‚Äôs taking it too far, for me. I have been doing that myself, and gotten bad feedback afterwards from players, and I have been in situations where someone else have put me in the spot by doing that. (I play in all sorts of groups, often at convention so it‚Äôs almost always different participants doing that.)</p>
<p>So ‚Ä¶ I stopped doing that.</p>

          <p>I was searching the internet and found this thread : and I love it.</p>
<p>What strikes me as a specific use that I haven‚Äôt seen here is to ask questions where the assumption is meta, saying : ‚Äúthis is something your character can‚Äôt control‚Äù. So of course, if you have little control in the game, well that stings.</p>
<p>By meta I mean : ok, the question has a narrative interest, requires safety calibration, etc. All of this is true and very useful. But at the player level, we‚Äôre also saying : things from our past, a great deal of your environment, and a big chunk of our emotional responses (your hand is shaking, your stomach gargles, these little things) : we just don‚Äôt chose them. And to me, in game, it feels really liberating to keep experiencing agency through all that. So I like that kind of questions for this.</p>
<p>(Writing this, what strikes me, is how calibrating for safety is really : deigning balanced encounters, only from a narrative, dramatic, emotional perspective. That is : if the constraint is too strong, the experience is a downer. Well, maybe just showing that player agency lives through it is enough. Anyway, that‚Äôs a different topic.)</p>

          <p>Perhaps too late to the discussion but I‚Äôm surprised nobody said anything about <em>player expectations</em>, as in what the players expect from the game and setting whenever they hear certain keywords. This is the best source of input for the GM and a really good starting point to get the creativity of the whole group of players to start flying away in the same direction.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs really a simple method: pay attention to the player‚Äôs choices on their character sheet and <strong>ask them about those choices</strong>. Like, if a player choose to play a ranger elf, that player has already visualized ho elves are and why there are rangers among them, either if she‚Äôs the only ranger among them or the last elf in the setting. Or the opposite, both are excellent points to start a conversation. It‚Äôs like getting to know anybody after all, you will get that person talking a bit more if you ask them about him/herself than if you start making assumptions about that person and telling them about what you think of them.</p>
<p><em>(which ends up being cool if your assumptions stroke the ego of the player, as in ‚Äúyour character is famous for something he did, what is it?‚Äù. It ends up being ok if you make bad assumptions upon a bad dice roll, as in ‚Äúyou rolled a 5 on charisma, why does this NPC thinks what you just said was an insult?‚Äù. And it ends up being aggressive when you make assumptions that destroy player‚Äôs expectations, as (maybe) in ‚ÄúWho killed your sensei?‚Äù. It‚Äôs not like players can‚Äôt adapt and improvise something, but if you see them take a pause you probably put them on the spot because you just killed some expectations and now they have to readjust.)</em></p>
<p>Back to player‚Äôs choices: the trick to keep things under control (because believe me: once you start asking the players about how they envision this or that about their character <em>they won‚Äôt stop talking</em>) is to ask, oracle the dice if they fly too high and link whatever they say to another PC or NPC. Let‚Äôs go step by step:</p>
<p>-Ask the player about their character. If they choose a dwarf ask her how are dwarves like, what do they do for a living, what are they famous for, where do they live (it works best if players also create the important spots on the setting map). So far things may be just color until you ask the player how do they fare with other people - this question may create a whole front and make dwarves important to the story, especially if they don‚Äôt get along with strangers, are too rich or powerful.</p>
<p>-How powerful are they? If you think players are creating advantages or just going too far, oracle the dice, the higher the result the more truth there is in whatever they say. Just roll in the open so everyone can see if what the player said was true or just exaggeration proper of a dwarf. I forgot to mention that before asking anything to the players I explain them that whetever they create will be <strong>what their characters know</strong> which may or may not be actually true and would be up to them to find it out, if they want.</p>
<p>-Link everything: whenever a player is talking too much don‚Äôt be afraid to interrupt him and link whatever they said to another PC to give another player the chance to give you more input, building upon whatever has been said before. If one player says dwarves don‚Äôt get along with other people ask the one playing the elf what legends do they tell about Dwarves, get them to talk to each other to confirm and create more lore. Ask them how did they become friends (which is another good assumption, saves time and avoids PvP)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, listen. Everything can and will be used against them.</p>
<p>Bonds may be trickier, I tend to use a random table to give players some inspiration and let them detail those bonds further. It‚Äôs enough for each PC to have one bond with another PC until the whole group is linked. Each character also needs a bond with one front at least, or with the main villain. A shared hate can get them going as well as any common objective.</p>
<p>Perhaps the trick is to ask the characters for lore about themselves? Not sure if I should put it that way.</p>
