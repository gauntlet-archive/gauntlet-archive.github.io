    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/merit-badges-for-games/1674</link>
    <description>Ok, so I saw this on twitter and thought it was a super interesting way to encourage player behavior: https://twitter.com/65thvictor/status/1115279026585841664?s=21

I’m not sure what these badges will be for in particular (the screenshot shows one just for a bad roll I think?) but I immediately thought about it being a great way to encourage a certain play culture. Just having some badges listed somewhere could go a long way to show new Gauntleers best practices for games.

Not to mention, the idea of including them in an actual rulebook (or as a digital add-on or whatever) seems like a cool way to set player and table expectations. I kind of want to add a little handout to every game I’ve written now.</description>

              <p>I’m not so sure about this. Earning Merit Badges sounds a bit like work and could easily become competetive. I prefer calling out everyone’s highlight after a session via Star or Rose, really.</p>
<p>Having such a system in a game would make me feel insecure and invoke a fear of inadequacy. Like, “will I get a badge? Am I good enough?”, and that would not add to the fun I’d have.</p>

              <p>Burning Wheel does this! Although it’s a lot more focused and serious, and instead of being one time badges, they’re repeatable.</p>
<p>Right Skill, Right Time: have an absurdly niche skill that was perfect for the situation  (rare)<br>
Humor: get people to legit break into laughter during the action (really interesting because it’s really about creating intensity and then giving people a way to vent some of that intensity)<br>
Workhorse: be the player who kept everyone going consistently and made things happen (usually earned every session, only one allowed per session, voted on)<br>
MVP: be the player who made the decisive roll, had that one big moment that turned things around or secured success (usually earned every session, one allowed per session, voted on)</p>
<p>Having it all in an end of session phase is great, because it helps you get away from Skinner-esque incentives. Instead of doing things to trigger rewards, you’re going back and reflecting on your experiences. I love that because it lets you relate to your character experiences in a more detached way.</p>
<p>I’d love to see games with less serious rewards like these badges, to keep things fun.</p>

I could even see prepping some achievements or badges for the specific system or game I was running (or better yet, doing it as a ritual with the players the day before the game or something), and maybe even specific ones for the player if I’m familiar enough with them (to encourage coming out of their shell, or listening more, or engaging with the game mechanics).</p>

              <p>It’s certainly something to consider. We already kinda do it with roses and stars, but I like giving it more weight (“You get the ‘Shared the Spotlight’ badge!”).</p>
<p>The awarding them part would be a little tricky. I think a combination of the two methods you mentioned (players giving them to each other and also making their case) would be ideal. We could even have a badge for awarding badges to others</p>

              <p>True! I would kind of love a badge checklist as an end-of-session thing even. Could make it so they’re like fan mail that can only be awarded by other players or the GM? Or proposed by the player and then awarded by the table kinda thing so they don’t feel passed over?</p>
<p>Not sure if it could interfere with the game proper like you say, but if they were properly crafted I’d think it could be pretty cool. Anyway, got me thinking!</p>

              <p>I like that idea a lot! It’s like gamifying player principles/agenda in a way. My only concern would be if some people might take it too far and break their immersion in favor of getting the pretty, as well as the inevitable “I’m not doing as well as Player X, who has more badges than me” (which since we’re talking about rewarding adequate behavior, might be a feature rather than a bug)</p>

              <p>Ok, so I saw this on twitter and thought it was a super interesting way to encourage player behavior: <a href="https://twitter.com/65thvictor/status/1115279026585841664?s=21" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/65thvictor/status/1115279026585841664?s=21</a></p>
<p>I’m not sure what these badges will be for in particular (the screenshot shows one just for a bad roll I think?) but I immediately thought about it being a great way to encourage a certain play culture. Just having some badges listed somewhere could go a long way to show new Gauntleers best practices for games.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the idea of including them in an actual rulebook (or as a digital add-on or whatever) seems like a cool way to set player and table expectations. I kind of want to add a little handout to every game I’ve written now.</p>
