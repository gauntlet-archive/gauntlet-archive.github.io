    <title>Mouse Guard Long Con</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/mouse-guard-long-con/3835</link>
    <description>I’m planning a three day Long Con of Mouse Guard: we’ll be playing a series of Mouse Guard sessions back to back with the same crew over the course of a long weekend. I’m not sure how many sessions we’ll have time to do, but I wanted to have a lot of material to draw from, since I won’t have much time to prep between sessions.

I drafted an outline for the missions (two per season) and I’d be interested in any feedback. My goal was to create a variety of missions that have an overarching premise: something that would feel cohesive but not repetitive. In play, I imagine these missions will change quite a bit based on the beliefs and goals of the Guard mice, but I also don’t want to have to rely completely on improvised stakes.

I also wanted to choose missions that would leave a lot of loose ends to potentially be resolved in the player turn. Most of the missions are defensive and logistical. If the patrol want to try to win back lost territories, they have to try that on their own time.

Let me know what you think!

              <p>Yes!  Great question.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I wanted all the missions to have a sufficiently interesting hook.  Do these all seem like worthy uses of the guardmice’s time?  Are the stakes clear enough in these brief descriptions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanted to bring up varied challenges related to the premise (the Guard at war).  Are these missions sufficiently varied?  Does the progression of events seem logical?  Do the missions feel seasonally appropriate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want these missions to leave openings for interesting player turns.  Do they all suggest opportunities for the players to want to follow-up on them?  (For example, the missions related to several towns seceeding don’t include anything that will help the people of those towns.  Maybe the players’ guard mice will want to help them in their new, precarious positions.)</p>
