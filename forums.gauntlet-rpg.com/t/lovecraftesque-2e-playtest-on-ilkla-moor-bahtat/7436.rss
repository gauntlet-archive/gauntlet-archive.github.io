Lovecraftesque is a collaborative storytelling game designed to create brooding cosmic horror in the vein of HP Lovecraft, but free of the weight of the Mythos and its sometimes problematic content. This session we will play with the scenario On Ilkla Moor Baht&#39;at by Becky Annison. The Witness is Effie Williams, a 12 year old evacuee from London who has recently been sent to Ben Rhydding in West Yorkshire to shelter from the Blitz. Billeted at a farm on the edge of the moors, Effie becomes aware of strange occurrences and her curiosity leads her to pursue them. (This is a playtest of the upcoming second edition of the game)

**System:**  Lovecraftesque 2E Playtest by Black Armada Games

**Duration:**  One 4-hour session

**Breaks:**  Three 5-minute breaks, at the top of the hour 

**Venue:**  Zoom, with PlayingCards.io to manage card play

**Recording:**  Yes, but made public only if consent by all the players

**Safety:**  Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, Open Door Policy. This series is operating under the Gauntlet&#39;s Community Code of Conduct (which can be found at https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)

**Content Warnings:**  Lovecraftesque is a game about horror, and we are likely to deal with some disturbing themes. These include existential dread, despair, mental health issues, violence and body horror. This particular scenario deals with wartime experience, recent bereavement, and features a young protagonist. We will have a discussion on content including lines and veils before we begin play.
