    <title>Dice Uses Beyond Rolling</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/dice-uses-beyond-rolling/7091</link>
    <description>Gamers love dice, and game-makers love to sell us dice, from very standard six-sided dice to the iconic polyhedrals of *D&amp;D* to even stranger fare. Obviously dice are most often used as randomizers, but that’s not the only use that can arise from their design.

For example, Avery Alder’s brilliant *[The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year)* uses dice as countdown clocks: you place dice on the map to represent long-term community projects, and tick them down turn-by-turn until they are completed—or something derails the project to set it back or destroy it entirely.

I also know a couple games that call on players to stack dice into towers and see how high they can go before they fall. [Icarus](https://www.huntersentertainment.com/icarus) has a teetering dice tower that represents the fragile achievements of a decadent civilization. (You can listen to me [playing the game on the podcast Bored Ghost here](https://www.boredghost.com/episode-151-blubbering-pt1-icarus/), where we tell the story of a collapsing Martian colony.) My own game [Victory Garden](https://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/victory-gardenhttps://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/victory-garden) is a solo journaling game where you’re stacking a dice tower higher and higher to represent the plant you’re growing to send off to war.

What other ways to use dice have you observed? **What else can we do with dice beyond rolling?**</description>

              <p>In <em><strong>Cobwebs</strong></em>, you have a dice drop sheet for scene selection, which is pretty interesting. It means that when you want to have a certain kind of scene, you can drop dice very carefully where you want it to occur. But if you’re open to a variety of scenes, you can drop from higher, with less control, and let the dice decide. (The number rolled by the die is also used for other purposes, getting two pieces of info from one interaction.)</p>

              <p>I remember two of those, one some years back, where the dice help you draw the room and consult a simple table to see its content, and you make various passes of this process to get the history of the dungeon, with collapsing, new uses for old spaces, etc. It’s very well known.</p>
<p>And there’s this other, more recent game I have mentionned, where all the visible sides of the dice are used to tell what’s in each room, its style, etc. It has a cyberpunk equivalent (or is it the other way around ?) which tells you the number of stories, the default security level for the building, etc. Being newer it may not be so well known, but still.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure a kind OSR person will find the time to switch the maglite of their knowledge on and illuminate this poorly lit place of our memories.</p>

Higher numbers move first, but it also becomes your threshold for fumble (on 2D6 rolls), and certain attacks can only be used if your initiative and the target’s are within a certain range.</p>

              <p>My game <strong>Matiné</strong> uses an initiative board, where the players place colored tokens on the board and the game master places dice, matching the players’ colors, to  tell the player how many opponent it’s character is facing.</p>
<p><strong>Zombie Cinema</strong> rolls dice, but I really like one nifty mechanic that creates active listening (which I feel is super important in roleplaying games). It’s participant vs participant. The ones who aren’t involved in a conflict may give one die to any side to show their support for where the story is going. I like tactile mechanics like that, handing a physical object over to someone, rather than just saying “I  support you, grab an extra die”.</p>
<p>I like using dice to keep track of hit points or to set a maximum level for the character. I mean, it’s pretty obvious what is max level if the player is handed a sixsided level die. I use this mostly in board games.</p>

              <p>In my game “<span class="hashtag">#Ladybeard</span>” I use dice to represent wrestlers forcing eachother out of a ring. You can slide, flick, or roll if you want though, so I am not sure if it fits what you’re asking.<br>

              <p>Gamers love dice, and game-makers love to sell us dice, from very standard six-sided dice to the iconic polyhedrals of <em>D&amp;D</em> to even stranger fare. Obviously dice are most often used as randomizers, but that’s not the only use that can arise from their design.</p>
<p>For example, Avery Alder’s brilliant <em><a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year" rel="nofollow noopener">The Quiet Year</a></em> uses dice as countdown clocks: you place dice on the map to represent long-term community projects, and tick them down turn-by-turn until they are completed—or something derails the project to set it back or destroy it entirely.</p>
<p>I also know a couple games that call on players to stack dice into towers and see how high they can go before they fall. <a href="https://www.huntersentertainment.com/icarus" rel="nofollow noopener">Icarus</a> has a teetering dice tower that represents the fragile achievements of a decadent civilization. (You can listen to me <a href="https://www.boredghost.com/episode-151-blubbering-pt1-icarus/" rel="nofollow noopener">playing the game on the podcast Bored Ghost here</a>, where we tell the story of a collapsing Martian colony.) My own game <a href="https://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/victory-gardenhttps://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/victory-garden" rel="nofollow noopener">Victory Garden</a> is a solo journaling game where you’re stacking a dice tower higher and higher to represent the plant you’re growing to send off to war.</p>
<p>What other ways to use dice have you observed? <strong>What else can we do with dice beyond rolling?</strong></p>
