Five stand-alone episodes exploring wuxia in different time periods of China and beyond.

(please note: **some material will be different** from the original [Hearts of Wulin playtest packet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4eTCjb5VZ3v3bKl3XvwZkHgAj0NCMxX), links to modified spreadsheet in each session posting)

[Hearts of Wulin: War Era](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LjT9TqDm2E8h8bVQBdu)  (one-shot, partial-gen)
[date=2019-08-03 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-08-03 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
There has always been war in the divided Middle Kingdom for as long as you lived. One of you is the favored eldest (Bravo) of the Duke of Zhao. One of you is a scholar (Aware) for the Duke of Yan. And one of you is a swordsman (Loyal) for the Duke of Chen. When duty and desire diverge, Who truly has command over your heart?

present subject but Veiled: horrors of war

media reference: Hero (Jet Li), The Advisers Alliance (series), historical Warring States (inspiration)

https://youtu.be/B3Ufxagb3eE

[Hearts of Wulin: Peace Era](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LjTDU66uABI9xD6hE85)  (one-shot, partial-gen)
[date=2019-08-10 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-08-10 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
At the height of a dynasty of peace and open borders, cultures clashed, but not without leaving a lasting impression on each other. One of you is an official (Loyal) from the Imperial court. One of you is a wanderer (Outsider) from a foreign land. And one of you is a hopeful apprentice (Student) of a local hero. Will a misunderstanding end a fledgling friendship, or can the faith in humanity overcome distrust of &quot;the other&quot;?

present subject but Veiled: racism, death

media reference: The Myth (Jackie Chan) + Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils (novel or tv series)

https://youtu.be/N-yS7VvCY3w

[Hearts of Wulin: Modern Era](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LjTFbCCBwjYqLuvX0ph)  (one-shot, partial-gen, ***NC17***)
[date=2019-08-17 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-08-17 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
Even if modern technology renders the old ways obsolete, tradition still has its place in the hearts of many. One of you is a younger sibling (Student) of a retiring champion. One of you is a traveling sifu (Aware). And one of you is a prodigy (Unorthodox). A prestigious but dangerous tournament brings you three onto the stage. But are you all after the same victory?

present subject: graphic violence, death, toxic power struggle?

media reference: Ip Man + Bloodsport (movie)

([semi-related analysis that contains Spoilers for those movies, &quot;Ip Man: How to Write Superman&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP2KlkBgol4), the commentator talks about ideas that are interesting to me, such as emotional journeys are important in a character&#39;s struggle, not just winning a physical fight)

[Hearts of Wulin: Space Era](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LjTH-KsIz5Fhs6MYRly)  (one-shot, partial-gen)
[date=2019-08-24 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-08-24 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
One of you is an accidental (Unorthodox) hero for the Asteroid Miners. One of you is a gallivant (Bravo) from Earth. And one of you is a rebel (Outsider) from the Mars colony. During Valentine&#39;s Cycle celebration on the Titan space station, will you be able to settle old scores or matters of the heart?

present subject but veiled: classism, regionalism

media reference: Firefly (tv) + The Expanse (tv) + Star Trek: Discovery (tv) + Wandering Earth (movie)

![te_gauntletforum|500x200](upload://m6CCCRDvbMOaFtywbmMWkGRYCh6.jpeg) 
(art by me)

[The Escort](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LjTL0xLvhVToy9p5kUZ)  (one-shot, pre-gen)
[date=2019-08-31 time=07:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;] → [date=2019-08-31 time=10:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;Asia/Shanghai&quot;]
[system is derived from Lady Blackbird](https://brushmen.github.io/trpg_hacks/theescort2019_en.pdf)
The Emperor has decreed that Xin must be publicly executed. Dao the Constable is tasked to carry out the order, Yu the escort agent is entrusted to lead the way to the execution ground, and Gong the mercenary is paid to see it through. Will justice be done by the end of the journey?

present subject but veiled: death

media reference: Justice Bao (tv), The Water Margins

              <p>I’m very interesting in this. However, I’m quite new to both this forum and Hearts of Wulin in general. If you received a bunch of RSVP and cancellations on the August 2nd event, that was probably me trying to figure out how everything works. It appears that there are still spots available for the August 2nd session. Are you still looking for players? Also, is there a background information or documents that you have available that I could use to familiarize myself with? The link (modified character keeper with different factions and images (for inspiration)) in the event page just sent me to the main event page.</p>
