    <title>FONT - a story game of hope and loss</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/font-a-story-game-of-hope-and-loss/6579</link>
    <description>[The Kickstarter for FONT is launching next week](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaeldunnoconnor/font-a-story-game-of-hope-and-loss).  It&#39;s a GMless game about travelers into a strange otherworld called the FISSURE seeking a source of miraculous power called the FONT, which may be the key to saving their home.  It&#39;s inspired by Andrei Tarkovsky&#39;s *Stalker* and Jeff VanderMeer&#39;s *Annihilation*.

I share it here in part because I developed FONT in part with feedback with folks from the Story Games Forums that I know migrated here.

The [PDF for FONT is available on itch.io](https://narrativedynamics.itch.io/font) but we will be making some revisions and creating a print run for the Kickstarter.  You may already have the PDF (since it was included in the itch Black Lives Matter bundle).

I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions about the game or design process.  Really looking forward to sharing this one!</description>

              <p>A few things have been added since the initial version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarification of the core procedures.</li>
<li>Different setting prompts for the kingdom you left.  These are being expanded a bit for the physical run.</li>
<li>Ways to help someone avoid a mark after failing, which leads to some more intercharacter moments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concise core is very much intact, and what has been added has been aimed at allowing groups to develop a shared understanding of character and setting more quickly.</p>

              <p>So cool. I still have the first draft for the 200 Word Challenge printed out, and it’s in my “book of many games” that I always bring with me on conventions. Haven’t gotten around to play it yet, sadly.</p>
<p>I saw on itchio that you expanded the game with 25 percent! <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Is it anything that have been added or is it just more clarifications?</p>
