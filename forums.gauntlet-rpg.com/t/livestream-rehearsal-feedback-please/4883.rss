    <title>Livestream rehearsal - feedback please?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/livestream-rehearsal-feedback-please/4883</link>
    <description>Hi all, I&#39;m planning on doing a bit of ttrpg related streaming during the shutdown. I&#39;ve done a rehearsal (30 min length) anyone willing to give it a listen and give any feedback?

https://youtu.be/uWltu8j5xlc

I&#39;m not so interested in feedback like &#39;Get a better microphone&#39;, but whether you think this stream would be at all interesting, whether there&#39;s anything I can improve in presentation and if I&#39;m doing anything dangerous in sharing some &#39;behind the scenes&#39; website stuff.

Thanks in advance!</description>
