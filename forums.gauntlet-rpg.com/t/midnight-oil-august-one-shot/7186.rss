    <title>Midnight Oil (August one shot)</title>

    <description>***I’m saving one spot for a player new to the Gauntlet, or who’s had trouble getting into games. If that’s you, please DM me to claim the spot.***

“The children of oil barons and fading nobility smile and shake hands on the football field, while conspiring to poison each other behind closed doors. Debauched parties give way to mystery cults, and at the edge of the quad a massive shape watches from afar, hungering for blood…”

Midnight Oil is a pbta game of mystery, magic and dark academia by Jay Dragon, which Jay describes as “an incomplete first draft” at this point. The mechanics are based on Apocalypse Keys and include some really cool and flavourful stuff, but standard warning for a game in playtest that it’s a work in progress and some parts may be a little rough. I think it will still be a lot of fun to play!

Subject matter: “Contains (both explicit and implicit) references to addiction, drug use, self-harm, queerphobia, colonialism, suicide, and assault. Additionally, this is a messy and at times painful game. It contains interactions between characters that blur the line between love and hatred, sex and violence. Characters can be controlling and manipulative, messy and harsh.”

We will use lines and veils, the X card, and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

We’ll be playing over Streamyard, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll record and post the session only if all players consent.

I’ll send an email a week before the session to confirm interest, share play materials, etc. 

Open access time for sign-ups is 12.30 pm 17 July AEST.
