    <title>On Zine Formats</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/on-zine-formats/1788</link>
    <description>I’ve putting together a little zine for games translated from languages other than English and I’m finding it super difficult to choose what format I want to do. 

In the beginning I’ll be just doing digital anyway, but I do want to have the option in the future of printing and so want to set it up from the get-go with possible printing in mind.

![image|640x480](upload://7AWTaTCdsgLbrzUxlEpSZ3Rsavw.jpeg) 
The first idea I had was to do the Scout Book format. Pocket size like the Planarch Codex (3.5 x 5).

Pros:
* Small and easy to take with you.
* Cheap to print, super duper cheap to ship ($1 worldwide)
* Chipboard and 100% recycled paper, soy-based-ink offset-printed, saddle-stitched.

Cons:
* Must be 32-pages
* Limited word count, though they do have a 5x7, bigger version, it might mean losing the super cheap shipping I’m not sure. Still means a limited and constrained word count due to required page count.
* Would not be able to release a PoD version without redoing layout (at least, not on drivethru as they don’t support either format).
* No option for colour interior.

In contrast, if I went with the more traditional, digest-size zine (6x9):

Pros:
* Familiar to the zine crowd
* Versatile (could do PoD, could set my own page count, could do colour interior if I want to.)

Cons:
* Shipping prices will be far more for sure.
* Not cool, different, or green.
* Most likely poorer quality for printing. Most likely all around more expensive to produce and ship if I ever did do physical.


What do people think? Do you prefer your zines in the traditional format or would you entertain pocket size? Do you have the Planarch Codex? What do you think of it and Scout Books?</description>

              <p>500 might be their unofficial minimum for offset. Their website says 750 to 50,000, but I didn’t see that before asking for a quote for 500, and the rep didn’t bat an eye.</p>
<p>Shipping to Vermont from Michigan was $177 for TPW and $102 for each of the other books.</p>

              <p>Not too shabby at all, price-wise. I love tour stuff and the quality is really nice. A couple more questions if you’re cool with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you know if 500 is the lowest size print run they do?</li>
<li>What was shipping like for them?</li>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/kyle_simons">@Kyle_Simons</a>, I use <a href="https://www.mcnaughton-gunn.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">McNaughton &amp; Gunn</a> in Saline, Michigan for Lampblack &amp; Brimstone stuff. I like digest-size (5.5"x8.5") because I find it easier to use at the table than other formats, and people can print a PDF of that size at home with little fuss.</p>
<p>If my dodgy records are to be trusted, the costs of the L&amp;B print books were:</p>
<p><em>The Perilous Wilds</em> (72pp, black &amp; white): $1620 for 1000 copies ($1.62 per unit).<br>
<em>A Book of Beasts</em> and <em>Freebooters on the Frontier</em> (32pp, black &amp; white): $745 for 500 copies ($1.49 per unit).</p>

              <p>It’s an ongoing zine, not a zine for one specific game. I’m sure there are some submissions I could split between issues, though, yeah.</p>
<p>The word count issue comes up because a lot of the submissions I’ve been getting are on the longer side, whereas a 3.5 x 5 pocket size zine will max out at 6,400 words per issue.</p>

              <p>I just meant for the price point. Pocket size is through Scout Books and they do offset printing. Works out to about $2 a copy, and the more you do the less it’ll cost per copy of course.</p>
<p>For 6x9 it’s be way more expensive to do something in decent quality in an off-set run, like <a class="mention" href="/u/jasonlutes">@jasonlutes</a> stuff. I’m sure he’d have more insight on it if he has the time! I’m not even sure what printers to approach for something saddle-stitched.</p>
