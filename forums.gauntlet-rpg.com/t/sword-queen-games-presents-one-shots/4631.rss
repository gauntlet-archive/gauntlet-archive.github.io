Hello! I am so grateful to how supportive the community has been. This is an experiment, I&#39;ll be offering one shots of my smaller games. This is not a series, so feel free to sign up for whichever one shot sounds interesting.

All sessions are 3.5 hours. Games will be taught as we play. Sessions will be recorded on Streamyard but only released for the public if all players consent after the session.

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.

***Have A Familiar Ring*** - a GM-less story of magic

***Come together friends, and tell a story of magic.***

***One of you will be a magic-user. On your hand you wear many rings, each belonging to a familiar. The rest of you will play those familiars, assisting and thwarting the magic-user as you please.***

***Together using prompts and permission to create a wild and untamed story, face the price of magic head on and write your destiny together.***

* Created for the [#YourMoveJam](https://itch.io/jam/your-move-jam), which stipulates working with the powered by apocalypse system to create a game centered around just ONE move.
* No GM or Facilitator required. Only prep is to read through the game once and then just get started!
* Evocative prompts to help you get started on your story.

**One-Shot:** [date=2020-03-24 time=09:00:00 timezone=&quot;Asia/Singapore&quot;] https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M0_Xgh1VWPGng-FkRDR

***The Unmasked*** - A Ghost Story

***Content Warning:*** this game heavily features death, grieving,regret, those we leave behind, unfinished business.

****T*here is so little time, little ghost.***

***Death won’t claim you. Not completely. Not just yet.***

***The Veil will grant you this one last chance.***

***Attend to your unfinished business, little one.***

***Before time runs out.***

Play as one of ***The Unmasked*** , those that stand between life and death. The time you have is extremely limited. You may ask ***The Veil*** for more time, but what if it makes time run faster still? This is an incredibly rules-lite game that focuses on story (PbtA inspired)

**One-Shot** [date=2020-03-31 time=09:00:00 timezone=&quot;Asia/Singapore&quot;] https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M0_YtYIBI8MLrev2Nxj

***CUT TO THE FEELINGS*** - a battle royal celebrating every color of love

*You are a Battle Babe. You are BEAUTIFUL, DARING, and full of GUILE.*

*Your weapon has chosen you. Are you a TRIDENT TRANS, a DAGGER DEMI, a SWORD LESBIAN? Roll the dice, find out, play a game that is focused on one thing: an all out battle that reveals the truest emotions.*

*When your TENACITY is depleted, you can no longer hold on to your pride. Let go, confess your truest feeling. What happens next? We play to find out!*

**One-Shot:** [date=2020-04-07 time=09:00:00 timezone=&quot;Asia/Singapore&quot;] https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M0__B106CqdApuEE0Ij

***Stories of Love In Manila*** - a tarot based story game

*We beings of pure magic and nature have learned how to adapt to the city life. In Manila, Elementals have learned to live life like we humans do. They go to work, pay the bills, think about traffic...they fall in love. And out of love. And in love, all over again.*

*Some of us Elementals have heard of the Reader, a gifted human who can see us for our magic. But more importantly, they can help us reclaim our destiny and rewrite our stories of love..*
