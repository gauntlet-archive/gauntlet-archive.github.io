    <description>There are slots still available for the Slings &amp; Arrows playtests in April.

This session is scheduled for 3 hours and will be recorded.

Slings &amp; Arrow is a game I&#39;m developing based on the TV series of the same name.  It would be nice if, after the session, you were available to give some feedback about what in the system worked or didn&#39;t work for you.  Attending every session is not required, though attending two in a row can be useful if we link them together.  You must RSVP each session you wish to attend.

Slings &amp; Arrows is about theatre people and how the show they&#39;re in seeps into their day jobs and personal lives.  You&#39;ll create an Actor and, during the Show Phases, you&#39;ll create the plot of the original play you&#39;re performing in.  We&#39;ll choose a genre and other details as a group before diving in to the play.  During the Real Life Phases, the relationships you&#39;ve Staked during the play will be tested in ways thematic to the play.  Playing a King whose country is falling down around their ears?  In Real Life you may have a kid who refuses to listen and makes your home chaos.

We will be using the X-Card and will be playing in accordance with the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.  There is a tone, lines &amp; veils discussion as part of the creation of the play.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools. The [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use, also there is a tone, lines, &amp; veils discussion as part of the creation of the play.
