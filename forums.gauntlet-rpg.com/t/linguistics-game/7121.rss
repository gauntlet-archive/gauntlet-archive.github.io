    <description>Hello, 
I came upon the [Yukaghir love letter explained](http://historyview.blogspot.com/2011/10/yukaghir-girl-writes-love-letter.html) and immediately thought of making a game out of it. But I am lazy and would like your help to gather parts from other games. 

I thought of Dialect, because... linguistics, but there&#39;s also this sign language teaching game, and these ideogram teaching games - Yes @Ben_Bisogno I&#39;m looking at you ;) - and I think Sign In Stranger, with its way of getting to know an alien culture by way of an abstract map of things and concepts. And many others I ignore, maybe about mystery, communication ?

If you know such a game, how do you see it working for a &quot;text drawing&quot; (// map drawing) game. Where do you think it would fail ?

Thanks in advance for your help.</description>

    My question: What could be improved? Is the way to use this card self evident? 

The project: 
I am at the start of a long project developing an RPG system for learning how to write in Japanese. 
I am trying to develop a minimal viable example for a playtest. 
The system: 
Inspired by No Dice No Masters, players would invoke a “spell component”, a part of the character, and do something in-game associated with it. 
Then the player would flip the card, write the character without seeing it, and c…
