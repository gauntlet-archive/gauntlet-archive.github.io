    <title>Any recommendations for good forum software for play-by-post?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/any-recommendations-for-good-forum-software-for-play-by-post/3424</link>
    <description>Originally I tried gamersplane, but it&#39;s pretty buggy and it seems like the team is unable to fix some pretty big issues. It&#39;s so close to what I want though!

I want subforums, access control per forum, and ideally the ability to generate dice rolls with a post.

Alternately I could host a forum myself, but I&#39;m not sure of what a good option would be, especially for RPG specific nice to haves. I also don&#39;t want to get super mired in configuration. I&#39;m technically enough to set it all up, I&#39;m just worried about it becoming a huge time sink...

Any thoughts?</description>

              <p>I’ve used Tavern Keeper quite a lot and it’s pretty good because each game is set up sort of like a wiki page.</p>
<p>I’ve also used <a href="https://www.rolegate.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Role Gate</a>. It’s another pretty good site with plenty of PbtA games going on. I think it might be the best mobile friendly one out there but not perfect but any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.myth-weavers.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Mythweavers</a> if you want to be able to organize your game to the max. It’s an older site that I think is starting to show its age. Every game is essentially its own forum so you can make individual posts that can be organized into folders/categories and sub folders from there.</p>
<p>Edit:Role Gate also has a discord channel for recruiting and just generally asking questions.</p>

<p>That sounds pretty sweet! I generally use <a href="http://rpggeek.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rpggeek.com </a>. It’s pretty good. It has more functions than this forum for controlling fonts, font colors, adding headers, etc. and includes a dice roller.</p>

<p>RPGGeek is great. I think a lot of people are put off by the UI, but if they can get over the dated interface (which is look somewhat improved nowadays), I think they’ll find a robust tool set.</p>
<p>RPGGeek has put a lot of effort into building out their PbP tools over the years. I think having a dedicated character tracker would be handy, but those can always be housed on Google Docs or something.</p>

<p>I am interested in the potential for mRPG. It is a mobile PbF app with a dice roll, a clunky way to create character templates, and a very good looking interface to find a game / players. I haven’t tried it yet though.</p>

              <p>Hit up <a href="https://www.tavern-keeper.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Tavern Keeper</a> for sure! Ability to roll dice within posts, have OOC forum discussions, Wiki reference information, privacy settings based on campaign/game, etc.</p>
<p>One of the cool things is the ability to comment on a specific post – the comment is on the “flip side” of the post (it literally “flips around” in the UI), so it doesn’t interrupt the narrative. Best ways I’ve seen that feature used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss mechanics related to the post (ie: “Roll X move” or “I got an 8, so I choose X option from the list”)</li>
<li>Give audience reative to a specific post without those getting in the way (“Oooh! I sense romance!” or “Dang, killer post, friend!”). I find this helps give the group a sense of togetherness, even though you’re not in the same room.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few little bugs (mostly around invites to new players) and the game/player search needs an upgrade, but they’ve been working on a 2.0 version for a while that (fingers crossed) will clean that up. It’s definitely my favorite place to play pbp. Feels very clean and easy to navigate once you’ve got a game rolling.</p>
<p>Happy to answer any questions you run into if you go that route! There’s also a TavernKeeper Discord with lots of folks who are helpful in answering any technical questions you might run into.</p>
