    <description>Looking for recommendations for story games that you would specifically recommend for 3-5 players with no story game experience and little to no tabletop RPG experience.

All participants are eager to give this type of game a shot, one has some theater improv experience, one used to play AD&amp;D way back in the day, and one has had a one of experience with Swords &amp; Wizardry at a con.

As far as trope experience, 3 of the 4 core group are familiar with most mainstream fantasy tropes a la Tolkein/Game of Thrones while the one with improv experience has virtually no experience with classic fantasy and sci-fi whatsoever. Three women, one man, two of whom are queer identified. All creative, imaginative, outgoing, and comfortable taking emotional risks.

Open to virtually any genre, but those which require immersive knowledge of niche setting tropes will probably not work for all the players. (e.g. Steampunk, Cyberpunk, Classic D&amp;D, etc.)

Some I&#39;ve heard favorable things about, but not certain whether they&#39;d be recommended as first games with the above group:

Fiasco (have already ordered the physical books)
Dream Askew / Dream Apart
Prime Time Adventures
The Shab-al-Hiri Roach
Our Last Best Hope
A Quiet year
Microscope
Kingdom
Ironborn</description>

              <p>If your players are into slasher movies in the style of Halloween perhaps give Final Girl a try: <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/182628/The-Final-Girl" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/182628/The-Final-Girl</a><br>
I think it’s fairly easy to facilitate. The mechanics are straightforward, the genre should be well known and you can put it in all kinds of settings. It’s a bit odd in the sense, that you don’t play a single character, but everyone creates 3-5 characters for all pool from which everyone can pick. And of course don’t be to attached to the PCs as they die over the course of the game.</p>
<p>If you like drama, but don’t want to see anyone dying. Perhaps try the Final Girl Hack “Game of Love” in Codex Love 2. It transforms the Game basically into Bachelorette. And it’s a ton of fun!</p>

              <p>(Hi! The author of While the World Ends here.)</p>
<p>WTWE on 3 plays pretty much like a GM’ed game.  One player taking both characters on one side and the others play one each on the other side.</p>
<p>Also, if you get the black version of the game through DriveThruRPG you get two setting variants, an Arabian Nights inspired one, and one about time travellers.  Both of those do very well at three players, but trade the team mechanic for individual success.</p>

<p><em>A Taste for Murder</em> is a cute British murder mystery. You all play a “guest” at the party of whatever, then someone (somewhat randomly) gets killed, and that player gets to come in as the detective trying to solve their own murder.</p>

<p>Otherwise I would suggest <strong>The Name of God</strong>, especially its Deeper Edition. It’s a dark urban fantasy in the vein of many Neil Gaiman stories, and its minimalist but tight system should be easy to follow for any kind of player, if well intentioned.<br>

              <p><em><a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/the-quiet-year" rel="nofollow noopener">The Quite Year</a></em> is a good choice I think. It does have a removed/analytical/bird’s eye view aspect to it, that I also associate with some other games like <em>Universalis</em>. This is chiefly because you don’t directly represent single individuals, though as part of the emergent play you do start to identify with factions - the contempt token mechanic in <em>The Quiet Year</em> seems to encourage this (technically it’s about the player but it seems to harmonize to the factions players create and speak for in discussions in my experience).</p>
<p>I recorded a video showing off the new version of the game here: <a href="https://youtu.be/BYGAow7EJPs" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/BYGAow7EJPs</a><br>
For your first play of <em>The Quiet Year</em>, you may want to shorten the deck, discard a few cards of each suit (but keep the King of Summer and King of Winter.)  I played online recently, and the game is certainly slower online.</p>
<p>If your group is a fan of Metal, then <em>Umlaut: The Game of Metal</em>, may be of interest. It’s got a pretty laid back style and has each player control a band, the game session ends in a “battle of the bands.”</p>
<p>For things that are a little more direct and “personal”:<br>
Folks missing sharing music with friends on roadtrips could really enjoy <a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/ribbon-drive" rel="nofollow noopener">Ribbon Drive</a>. This does require each player to create a “playlist” of songs before the game. This one is maybe a little harder to grapple for a first game.</p>
<p><a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/posthuman-pathways" rel="nofollow noopener">Posthuman Pathways</a> is good for three players. You rotate roles in each scene, and explore some technological change that has altered what it means to be human. Functionally you are playing out a series of questions with scenes between two participants. It reminds me a little of <em>A Penny for Your Thoughts</em>.<br>
Posthuman Pathways is 5 one-page pamphlets, 3 of which you pass around as you change roles.</p>
<p><a href="https://composedreamgames.com/marketplace/Genesis-of-Legend-Publishing/Palanquin" rel="nofollow noopener">Palanquin</a> is about a Princess escaping from bloody usurpers. The game is really about the journey to safety, and the type of challenges faced are based on which companions are selected. (Don’t want “fighting” to be part of the narrative, then don’t pick the Veteran as a companion.) The player who plays the princess, is the facilitator who should know the rules best.<br>
Interestingly, <em>Palanquin</em> suggest <em>For The Queen</em> as a follow-up game set decades in the future.</p>

              <p>The ‘right’ Fiasco playset is important.  I usually ask people to give me 2 films or TV programmes they’d want to be in and then look for a playset which reflects at least one from each person.  The genre remains ‘Fargo’, but having trappings that everyone can relate to and visualise is, in my experience, important for new players.</p>
<p>I worry less about completing the full play cycle in the first session … I just want to get people used to ‘pretending’ in a grown up way.</p>

<p>The set-up is light (basically making lists of story prompts, chatting about who you are / where you are etc), and the game’s setting agnostic, so could be a good one to let your table find a space that works for all of them and just have a good time. We like it a lot to set up a feel for worlds we’re going to go on to play in with other systems, but I can see it being an excellent way to just spend an afternoon trying to out-do each other if you’re not fussed about carrying it forward</p>

              <p>Fiasco<br>
My introduction to story games, like many, was through Fiasco. In my case, I joined in a game of Fiasco with a group who had played the game before. Advantages with it are the helpful videos that can give you an idea of gameplay and the plethera of free playsets for that system out there.  Just google “Fiasco Playsets” and you’ll see what I mean.  Finding a good playset can make or break the experience, in my opinion. I usually have fun with Fiasco because my group enjoys the improv of it, but I can say that our best times were when we all found a playset that we all thought was a cool one. A couple of concerns with Fiasco I have for a totally new group. When I first played, the session lasted more than 4 hours. I’m not sure this is typical, but it really depends on how long and involved the “scenes” become, which is something you may want to consider. Are you wanting something that is complete in a few hours or do you plan on longer? Another issue we’ve had with Fiasco is the tone, it can devolve into silly ridiculousness. So long as all the players are onboard with that, it’s fine…I’d say set a kinda expectation of how serious everyone wants to play prior to starting.</p>
<p>For the Queen - I’ve had good luck introducing story gaming to completely new players this way. I would say that being more comfortable with emotions, especially love, would be important for them to enjoy this game. Also, a safety tool is already built into the game, which is a helpful thing to learn about story games anyway. This game, for us, ended up being pretty short, I believe less an hour. There are some hacks of this game out there that are re-themes, in case the original theme isn’t to your liking.</p>
<p>Cozy Town - I’ve also had a good time introducing collaborative story games with Cozy Town. It’s a collaborative town-building kind of game, easy to pick up and play. It ran about 3.5 hours for us, though that depends on how much detail you all decide to go with. <a href="https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/cozy-town" rel="nofollow noopener">https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/cozy-town</a></p>

              <p>It’s a pretty difficult question, actually: the GM role is called “the Opposition”, and the game has some GMless techniques (e.g. the character players get to frame their own scenes much of the time).</p>
<p>However, I think having one all-powerful player who controls the rules and all the NPCs, and all the other players each having a character (who is a protagonist)… that’s pretty close to being a GMed game. Like, what else do you need?</p>
<p>More importantly, the Occupation’s role in the game is <em>explicitly</em> designed to be a commentary on the all-powerful GM (as you can read in the designer’s notes).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a great game, and I would recommend it. I wouldn’t say that the game is focused on violence - there is <em>oppression</em>, which can imply violence, but doesn’t need to. The violent moments, if there are any, could easily happen off-screen (unlike Contenders).</p>

<p>Not sure what SWM is referring to.</p>
<p>As for Contenders, traditional sports, combat, and militaristic themes are not going to be a good fit with some of the players in this group.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there can’t be any violence or combat in the games, but if that is the primary focus it will be a turn off for a few players.</p>

              <p>I’ll recommend Daniel Wood’s <a href="https://files.meetup.com/2003651/My%20Daughter%20The%20Queen%20of%20France%20-%20Game%20Chef%202011.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">My Daughter, the Queen of France</a>. It requires one player to come up with and pitch scenes, but due to the subject matter and scene sheets I’ve found that less challenging than for example Fiasco. The other players can dig into portraying and exploring their characters/roles in a very structured (and truly ingenious) way. Heavily on the emotional side.</p>
<p>For a more moody and dark game that’s also easy to play, I’ll point to <a href="https://mangelune.itch.io/lost-in-the-rain" rel="nofollow noopener">Lost in the Rain</a> by Vivien Feasson. Everyone gets tokens, there are a couple of ways to spend them, players/characters run out of them one after the other.</p>
<p>Another token-economy game (and likely the best one there is in the Indie space if you ask me) would be <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/198050/Dog-Eat-Dog" rel="nofollow noopener">Dog Eat Dog</a> by Liam Liwanag Burke. I’ve played this with a lot of different people including teenagers and every single game was stellar. It’s just really really good.</p>
<p>If you want something that focuses more on worldbuilding but still has an emotional/character play side, take a look at Caro Asercions <a href="https://seaexcursion.itch.io/street-magic" rel="nofollow noopener">i’m sorry did you say street magic</a>. Kind of an advanced Microscope.</p>

<p><em>Follow</em> is freeform in a similar way to <em>Fiasco</em> , and my group struggled with it in the same way. It’s very effective for some people, though!</p>

</aside>
<p>This is odd for me, because Follow gives you explicit goals and drives, whereas Fiasco feels like it’s just “I dunno, play some scenes?”  It is important for someone to step up and “show” people what a scene “looks like” but after that I’ve found it goes very well with first time players.</p>

              <p>I’ve had very good luck using <em>For the Queen</em> with people brand-new to RPGs. It helps having one or two experienced TTRPGers or LARPers in the mix to give the newbies an example of how the game works. The fact that it’s sort-of a card game seems to lower the barrier to entry for a lot of people apprehensive about RPGs who think they have to read a 300-page book to get it.</p>
<p>Once the plague times are over, another game you might want to consider is Meguey Baker’s <em>1001 Nights</em>. This one works well when played in conjunction with a dinner party. There’s enough of a structure to the game that prompts interesting storytelling.</p>
<p>If people like drawing maps, <em>The Quiet Year</em> is a good choice.</p>
<p>Two games I’d recommend against trying out with absolute beginners are <em>Fiasco</em> and <em>The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</em>. Both of those are a bit too free-form and can put a lot of pressure on newbies who haven’t yet found their role-playing sea legs. [However, if these newbies have a non-RPG storytelling, improv, or acting background, they might be excellent choices!]</p>

              <p><em>Zombie Cinema</em> and <em>Kagematsu</em>, great additions.</p>
<p><em>Kagematsu</em> has one challenge, though: the Kagematsu player needs to have a clear sense of how to play - I tried to play with a total beginner, and we found that they struggled as Kagematsu. It requires a little bit of a GM-like mindset. It’s not difficult, but would just require a quick 5-minute orientation for that player. That said, a great choice!</p>
<p>I have a nice Google sheet set up to play it online, which I could share.</p>
<p><em>Follow</em> is freeform in a similar way to <em>Fiasco</em>, and my group struggled with it in the same way. It’s very effective for some people, though!</p>
<p>Another great beginner’s game is <em>Within My Clutches</em>, by my friend David Berg. Unfortunately, it’s not available quite yet, I think. (You play supervillains trying to achieve their nefarious master plans, from the epic and tragic to the petty and ridiculous.)</p>
<p>EDIT: You could try to hit him up here, however!</p>
