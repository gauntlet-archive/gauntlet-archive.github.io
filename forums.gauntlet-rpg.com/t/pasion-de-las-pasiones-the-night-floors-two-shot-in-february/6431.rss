    <title>Pasión de las Pasiones: The Night Floors (two-shot in February)</title>

    <description>For years, the once-popular telenovela The Night Floors has struggled through half-baked plots, underwhelming melodrama, and steadily declining ratings. Now, the network has come up with one last, desperate gambit to save the show, with the main characters all recruited by a strange quasi-governmental conspiracy called Delta Green and sent off to fight supernatural menaces. Your first assignment is to look into the disappearance of a promising young artist named Abigail Rodriguez; a strange symbol found in her apartment hints at an occult connection. Can you set aside your secrets, rivalries and hidden passions long enough to find the girl? And which is the greater terror: cosmic horror or unrequited love?

One spot in this game is saved for Sabine V.

This game is an experiment, using Brandon Leon Gambetta’s telenovela game Pasión de las Pasiones to run a modern horror scenario from the Delta Green RPG. These rules are not meant for this type of game, and there may be some awkwardness where melodrama grinds against weirdness and terror. This will probably involve some hacking and tinkering with Pasiones, both up-front and between sessions based on player feedback. No rules knowledge is expected, and rules will be taught during play.

Sessions will be played on StreamYard and recorded if all players consent. The series will consist of three three-hour sessions with breaks on the hour. Attendance at both sessions is encouraged but not required.

We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door policy as safety tools, and the game will run according to the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

Open access time for sign ups is 8:30am 30 January, AEDT.
