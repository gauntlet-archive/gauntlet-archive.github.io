    <title>Codex - Hunger Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-hunger-miscellany/1747</link>
    <description>Hey Gauntleteers, it’s time to crowdsource the miscellany for Codex - Hunger. This miscellany is called “Three Dozen Coveted Collector’s Items.” Submissions need to be a single sentence, or 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you&#39;re agreeing to let us use it (you&#39;ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Here are some examples:

“The writings of Saint Merione are beautifully poetic nonsense, but some swear by their prophetic powers. If this collection really is of her lost work, it’s beyond value. (And if not, well. People will believe what they want.)”

“There are only six known mint-in-box Cmdr. Jadirel figures mistakenly made with her head on Capt. Elber’s uniform base. The owner of the third just died, and the will won’t be read for nearly a month.”

“The reclusive artist (or collective) known only as Guliyev sells their work only rarely, and then only to private collectors. The Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam is set to unveil three original Guliyevs next week.”

P.S. If you want to be credited as something other than your forum name, let me know!

              <p>The Custom Doll is, objectively speaking, quite plain: a cloth body, buttons for eyes, a string for a mouth. It remains nonetheless prized by collectors because, no matter who holds it, it always looks like a doll of oneself. It changes hands often, however, as collectors gradually lose their appreciation for the resemblance.</p>
<p>There are <em>way</em> more than 30 silver coins circulating among sellers claiming to have one of the original 30 pieces paid to Judas, so be skeptical of anyone who claims to have put together the complete set. You’ll know you have a real one, though, when strangers begin whispering about you as you pass. You’ll know you have a few real ones, even, when the whispering stops, and the staring begins.</p>
<p>A man once had a key that opened a gate that led down a tunnel that opened into the afterlife. He lost the key. He can’t remember what it looks like; that was a long time ago. Now he collects keys of all shapes and sizes, on the off chance one leads someplace just as interesting, or perhaps even back home.</p>

              <p>The GRUNTS action playset of the STARS vehicle, a ‘tactical space shuttle’ piloted by the character Wally ‘Woodstock’ Brown, was hastily recalled just before shipping as a response to the <em>Challenger</em> disaster. Only a dozen or so pre-production models sent to toy fairs and TV executives were not recovered. They have never entered the secondary market, and speculation about the astronomical price one would fetch are a perennial subject on the reddit/r/toys/GRUNTS group.</p>
<p>The hashtag <span class="hashtag">#spentcasings</span> has blown up since the Vice special on supers fans who scour the scenes of past battles for the cast-off detritus of their heroes (and villains) of choice. Now the main subject of that piece, collector <span class="mention">@scourthescene</span> claims to have dug up the jacket for the depleted Moxiumite round that pierced Kid Solomon’s mask and ended his career as the (New) Gauntleteer’s protegee. Metaforensic experts are calling the discovery into question, but until it’s submitted to Solomon Labs for a full analysis, we won’t know for sure.</p>
<p>“See, this isn’t just ANY Narcosis Comics Tarot deck, right? I swear to Ozroch, I’ve done like four or five dozen readings with this deck, and no matter who it is, or what they ask about, somehow the same four cards <em>always</em> show up in every spread. Sometimes they’re reversed, sometimes regular, but they’re always there: Hanged Man, The Devil, High Priestess, and fuckin’ DEATH, man. I don’t know whether to burn this thing or put it on eBay.”</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, baroque and elaborate perfume bottles are, as we all know, a mainstay of the glass collecting world, but few are as coveted as the ones that can be authenticated as having sat on the mantles and boudoir tables of the infamous Hargrave House. It is a commonly-held urban legend that the occult reputation of that Victorian gentleman’s club permeates any objects that survived its destruction during the London Blitz. Our next lot consists of two misters and one cologne bottle, all recovered from the ruins in 1943 and until now in the hands of a former club member, whose estate offers this lot. Shall we open bidding at twenty thousand pounds?”</p>
