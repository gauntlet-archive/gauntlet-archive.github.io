    <title>Gauntlet Podcast: Nahual, Lighthearted, Amber</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-podcast-nahual-lighthearted-amber/3680</link>
    <description>In this episode we officially welcome our new co-host, @Sarah. Together with @Auzumel_S and I, the three of us plan to alternate hosting duties so no one person is on every episode. If you have a project or thing you want to talk about, reach out to us about being a guest. The only requirement is that you talk about a Gauntlet Hangouts game you ran or played the previous month.

This episode features @Kurt_Potts&#39; new game,  *Lighthearted* . It also looks at how setting informs play in  *Nahual*  by @miguelmx. The guest segment has us talking about playing historical games.  Give it a listen and please reshare liberally!
