    <description>Hey, folks!

Just wanted to take a moment to announce that The Gauntlet has agreed to set me up as the official Virtual Vendor for Gauntlet Open Gaming Weekend!

I&#39;ll have a channel on the Discord (#jim-likes-games-virtual-booth) where I can answer questions about stock, show off my tiny little office, and maybe even show your order packed in real time!

Place orders directly through the web site: https://jimlikesgames.com/ 

Every order over $50 will include a FREE Gauntlet pin OR keychain (both if you go in for $100), your choice.

The Gauntlet has also purchased TWO $50 gift certificates to the store! ONE will be randomly awarded to an OGW attendee who drops into the Discord thread and tells me what THEY like in the following format: &quot;NAME likes THING (or person, place, whatever).&quot; Contest runs from the official start of the con through the end. I&#39;ll contact the winner afterwards.

The OTHER $50 Gift certificate will be awarded randomly to one lucky customer who makes any confirmed paid purchase during OGW. Again, I&#39;ll let you know after the show, so you can use the GC right away to include in your shipment, or save for a later date. Thanks to the Gauntlet for sponsoring this giveaway!
