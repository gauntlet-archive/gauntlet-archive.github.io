    <title>End of the Line: Descending Phoenix</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/end-of-the-line-descending-phoenix/5066</link>
    <description>The *Phoenix* has been a good and loyal vessel. But the enchantments that give her life, flight, and intelligence are fading. As she sets off on her final voyage, you, the members of the crew, are faced with a final question: Will you say goodbye?

End of the Line is a game by April Kit Walsh based on For the Queen. As players, you take turns answering questions about your relationship with the ship that has been your home and possibly your friend. Along the way, our answers will define who the ship was, and the nature of the universe it inhabits. As the ship nears the end of its journey, you must ask yourself: How will this loss affect you?

We will be using the X-Card, the Open Table policy, and Lines and Veils as safety tools. Tone will probably be PG-ish.
