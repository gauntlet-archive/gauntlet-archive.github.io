          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/10/12/crowdfunding-collection-152/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #152, including every tabletop rpg project started between 09/27 and 10/11</b></a>.</p>
<p>Back after two weeks with no less than a total of 91 projects, of which 18 are ttrpgs. If you like to get directly to the meat of the collection, just skip my rather long preamble.</p>
<p>Though lets start with <b>Acheron</b>. The game introduces the players to the concept of „Grimpunk“, which in this case involves alternative 1930ties. A world that offers eldritch horrors to be fought and overcome by the heroes. The system provides a mix of narrative elements, three sanity attributes and a deadly combat system. I think it’s interesting and deserves a look. <b>Throwing Hornes</b> offers less dark setting, as you set out for a tour with your demon metal band through hell. The game is presented as a small zine and played with d6. To stick to the topic of demons, and add some angels into the mix, in <b>Era: Forbidden</b> both are at war. You’ll be playing as supernaturally enhanced humans, trying to avoid that humanity ends up as a collateral of the raging war. In regards to mechanics it uses the well tested Era d10 System. Maybe you are looking for something narrative? Then check out <b>Spindlewheel</b>. A game in which you weave stories as a group with the help of tarot cards.<br>
In regards of fantasy games, <b>Yonder</b> has the player characters flee from a calamity. The search for refugee and the run will bring their true character to the front, which may include literal transformation. I am intruiged, given that the book aimes to be graphic novel size (~150 pages) and the mechanics presented look interesting, I am in. If you like Blades in the Dark but look for some planar fantasy, check out <b>Sig: City of Blades</b>. The setting looks colorful, interesting and you should take a look for yourself. Maybe you played Stars without Numbers but wished it was fantasy? Then <b>Worlds Without Number</b> has you covered with their aesthetically pleasing take on bringing the OSR mechanics to a fantasy world.<br>
There are some games, which imho fit the Halloween season fine. Like being scary but not to much horror. For example <b>MORTASHEEN</b> pretty much nails the look for me, even as it is a bit shy on how it is played. Then you should check out <b>Gruesome Ghoulies</b>. You’ll be playing rowdy ghouls, investigating mysteries, driving Hot Rods and playing Rock’n’Rool. The game is available in a free One-Sheet version and the Kickstarter aims to finances a zine upgrade. Cool. Then there’s <b>Rest in Pieces</b>, which describes itself as a „Card &amp; Block Tower RPG“. Basically hoping to emulate fast, funny and bizarre cartoon action ala Rick &amp; Morty ab. While I am not sure about the mechanics, I didn’t delve to deep into it, it has the looks.<br>
If you prefer your horror more horrific, maybe check out <b>Terrors and Tommyguns</b>. The game combines cosmic horror and the 1920s, along with a d20 rollover system. If you are up for some American Gothic … Horror, check out <b>Flames of Freedom</b>. It throws you into the revolution of 1776 and sees you fighting monsters next to the confederates using the system introduced by Zweihänder. I am intruiged, as they do actually got consultants and try to differ a bit from a „European White“ point of view, which tends to be the usual approach. If you like a quick, one shot rpg, check out <b>Fright Nights: Wendigo RPG</b>. An adventure and RPG all in one little zine, aimed at beginner STs and players alike (next to more experience ones). It is part of an intruiging series. Then there’s the <b>Widdershins</b> RPG, which explores the 1910 setting of Whyborne &amp; Griffins- a queer romance series. While I don’t know the source, it looks like fighting eldritch horror Jane Austen style, something quite fascintating. Check it out.<br>
For people who like SF, maybe take a look at <b>Weirdspace</b>. It offers a scifi sandbox setting with quite some British comedy. You can checkout a free 16-pages prerelease on DTRPG to get a look at the game, and it appears to be a very solid project. Maybe you have wondered what would happen if The Expanse and Doom were combined? Well, Will Power Games answer this scenario in <b>Death Diverse</b>. The lavishly illustrated project offers a fresh 5d6 system and does interest me. If you ever wished for a <b>Stargate SG-1</b> game, well, you are being served. Explore different worlds via Stargates and meddle in the conflict between Tau’ri and Goa’uld – all with a D&amp;D 5E variant system<br>
Next to those games there are many more intruiging, cool projects. As an avid fan of the World of Darkness I had to back <b>Ghost Hunters for World of Darkness 20th Anniversary</b>. The sourcebooks offers ghost hunters to be used with all WoD x20 gamelines, and might even be seen as kind of a core book. Super cool! Join in! If you are a fan of undead and necromantic things, maybe take a look at the <b>Dungeon Master’s Adventure Pack Issue 5 – Necropolis</b> zine, offering just that. There are intruiging adventures like <b>Ancient Undead Spider Wizard</b>, which will be funded along with a vinyl record, or you could try to understand mistosis (real life one) with the <b>The Great Divide</b> module for D&amp;D 5E. <b>The Snow Cone &amp; Sundae</b> dice for DCC see me strongly tempted. Well, and you could just make your own dice with the <b>Royal Mold System</b>. The card deck <b>Deck of Dungeons</b> from Germany might be worth having a look and I am intruiged by the <b>GAME THEORY IN THE AGE OF CHAOS</b> book project, which takes a rather political lense to game development.<br>
You’ll find these and many, many more intruiging projects here:</p>
