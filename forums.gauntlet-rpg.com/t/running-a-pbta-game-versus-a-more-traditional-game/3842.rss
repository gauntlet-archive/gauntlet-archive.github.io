    <title>Running a PbtA game versus a more traditional game?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/running-a-pbta-game-versus-a-more-traditional-game/3842</link>
    <description>I have tried on and off to run various powered by the apocalypse games. And it’s something I’d like to do more of in the future. I mostly play OSR games and find I often approach running PbtA games with that mindset and it doesn’t quite work. Or it feels like I am doing something backwards.

I was wondering if people thought this characterization of the difference in how the games should be run is apt: 

**OSR**: you are in this situation and you do something clever, so don’t roll the dice. Good job!
**PbtA**: you are in this situation (the game cares about) and you rolled well so you did something clever—what was it? Good job!

And, I guess some corollary to this would be clever play in PbtA games would be about managing when you do or don’t trigger moves in the game.

Or should I be thinking about this is a totally different way? (!!)</description>

              <p>This is very much like I feel about any game that has a philosophy like pbta (blades, heart/spire, etc), and games that are not like pbta (osr, “traditional games”, etc). The only times I’ve felt “punishment” or “necessary risk” in pbta are when the gm doesn’t fully get moves and tries to do their own thing instead of sticking with their moves and how the game is meant to be played. In comparison, most of the time when playing more “traditional” games, most rolls seems like necessary risks, and punishments when trying to do something cool.</p>
<p>I don’t know, but maybe this is really one of the clearly distinctions between osr and pbta.</p>

My experience is that missing a roll is generally bad news (and I find PbtA games usually call for the MC to be quite brutal on misses, or the game loses some of its teeth), but there is a reason the 7-9 tends to be the most common outcome: “that’s where the game lives,” as some others have said.</p>

In PbtA play, though, the complications are the reward, and what we’re looking forward to seeing.</p>

              <p>Ultimately, the biggest differences might be mechanical, with PBTA using 2d6 resolution dice, and utilizing an array of better-defined “moves”, while games descended from D&amp;D use d20 resolution dice and allowing for mostly freeform “actions” (with “attack” and “use skill” being almost the only two that are defined well enough to be named).</p>
<p>I mean, there are other differences, but they seem more stylistic to me, and mostly a matter of convention rather than anything that’s required by the rules.</p>

              <p>I agree; There’ve been a number of discussions here over the past few months about PbtA and OSR play/style, and having followed several, and participated in a few, I have arrived at the conclusion that the only meaningful difference between the two is the focus of play.  OSR play is challenge based, and “overcoming stuff” and “not dying” are serious parts of the playstyle (This is why I personally have zero interest in the OSR – if I wanted a challenge I wouldn’t be playing an RPG) while PbtA has its focus shifted towards the “dramatically interesting.”</p>
<p>Otherwise? Things are largely the same – yes, PbtA games have some components like “ask questions and use the answers” which are not standard in OSR play, but which are generally not incompatible with it either.  Yes, the OSR places greater emphasis on “prep” than PbtA games, but again, not actually incompatible with most PbtA games (in spite of what you might read in some parts of the internet).</p>
<p>This is why I’m always a little bit confused by how people seem to regard PbtA games as weird and difficult.</p>

              <p>Kind of a tangent, but i think “play to find out what happens” is a pretty core tenant of OSR play. People obsess over not railroading players, quantum ogres, and all that nonsense. The approach is different, is all. I think building the story by consensus isn’t a core tenant of PbtA games as well, just something that seems to be common to many. A lot of the examples of play in the AW book feel pretty “trad” in how they play out. Calling the GM “god-like” also seems out of place in a game you’re playing with your friends. The GM is another player.</p>

              <p>My jam is somewhere in the intersection between OSR and story-gaming, and PbtA is my preferred ruleset at the moment. I like a lot of the trappings of OSR-style play, but I prefer the “play to find out what happens” mindset of PbtA and other story-games.</p>
<p>I think the big difference between OSR and story-gaming is the handling of narrative control.</p>
<p>In OSR and other traditional games (D&amp;D, Pathfinder, GURPS, Champions, etc), the GM pretty much holds narrative control exclusively. In these games, the GM tends to take a more god-like role, where they mostly dictate what’s going on with everything, other than the PCs’ direct actions. The narrative is what the GM says it is, whether by fiat, by following a printed adventure (more-or-less), or by interpreting the results of dice rolls.</p>
<p>In PbtA, the fiction is a conversation between the GM and the players, and the storyline is built more-or-less by consensus between the players and the GM. For many moves, the GM will provide the <em>players</em> fictional options to choose between, or will throw the narration itself to the players.</p>

<p>In a PbtA game,  The players have more power and authority, based on the moves and the rules and the principles of the game.  As a result, however, the GM isn’t limited by having to fight fair: you are allowed and expected to hit them <em>precisely</em> where it hurts, because they have the tools to deal with it.</p>

<p>Ah, yes! I do think that an OSR-GM has a different set of priorities than a PbtA-GM, namely that the OSR-GM can prioritize player agency by presenting an interesting world full of opportunities instead of needing to push the players into situations that require the pre-designed moves.</p>

              <p>The single example that probably helped me get into this the most was a short one in Monster of the Week, where they talk about how if you’re shooting a zombie with a gun, you’re not triggering the “Kick Some Ass” move (which requires both sides to be able to get in a fight), you’re just dealing damage, and the proper response for the GM in that situation is probably “deal Harm as established” (in this case, dealing Harm to the zombie). (This would be a great example of a clever idea to avoid the risk of the dice!)</p>
<p>Add that to “make a GM Move when the table looks to you to see what happens”, and there’s a pretty clear second option for when you feel like you should be rolling dice: just make a GM Move. Have something happen. There’s going to be a lot of situations where it feels like there should be a die roll, and a lot of times the proper answer to that is going to be “something happens”. I think that answering that itch with “I make a GM Move” is probably the single-biggest change I’ve made to my GMing/MCing, for the better. (This includes making GM Moves that benefit players!)</p>
<p>And a lot of times, the clear answer is to engage one of the player-facing moves, so you do that. But GM Moves are a good, compact way to handle unclear situations.</p>

              <p>I think <em><strong>disclaiming responsibility</strong></em> as per what <a class="mention" href="/u/lumpley">@lumpley</a> and Meguey suggest in <em>Apocalypse World</em> (pg 86 in 2e) is key here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• <em><strong>Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.</strong></em> In order to play to and out what happens, you’ll need to pass decision-making off sometimes. Whenever something comes up that you’d prefer not to decide by personal whim and will, don’t. The game gives you four key tools you can use to disclaim responsibility: you can <em><strong>put it in your NPCs’ hands</strong></em>, you can <em><strong>put it in the players’ hands</strong></em>, you can <em><strong>create a countdown</strong></em>, or you can <em><strong>make it a stakes question</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming there are interesting and meaningful things that could come out of what happens you as the GM can sometimes decide that what <em>you</em> want to have happen in the game might influence things in an unfair way, so you want to take yourself out of the picture… One of the ways you can do this is to let the dice decide. John Harper appears to be a big fan of this since it’s basically the whole idea behind both <em>The Die of Fate</em> in <em>World of Dungeons</em> and the <em>Fortune Roll</em> in <em>Blades in the Dark</em>.</p>
<p>But I think it can be even more generalized than that, going back to the <em><strong>Roll dice or say yes</strong></em> dictum: if there is a real chance for a specific action to lead to multiple different interesting outcomes/situations, then engage the system’s mechanics, if not, then the action just happens. And this lines up just fine with OSR views of fictional positioning removing the need for rolls. You as the GM listen to what they say they are doing and you decide that based on all their setup it’s unlikely to fail, so no roll is needed.</p>
