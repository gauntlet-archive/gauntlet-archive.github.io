              <p>This is a dark mode:  Go into your profile to the preferences menu.  On the left side there will be a list of sub menus.  Click on “interface.”  There is a themes toggle, one of the options is dark.</p>

              <p>I absolutely agree – the clean design is really great (I do wish there was a dark mode, but that’s a personal preference).</p>
<p>The thing I enjoy most, though, is the kind of community the Gauntlet is trying to foster here. It’s a far more constructive and methodical community than some forums can end up being and I appreciate that a lot.</p>
