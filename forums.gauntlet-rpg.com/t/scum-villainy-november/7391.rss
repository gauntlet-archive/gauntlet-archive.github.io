    <description>SCUM &amp; VILLAINY

***For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you have not played Scum &amp; Villainy with me before.***

“Pew-pew space adventures.” - John LeBoeuf-Little

Unwise deals. Blaster fights. 

High adventure among the stars.

“Scum and Villainy is a Forged in the Dark game about a spaceship crew trying to make ends meet under the iron-fisted rule of the Galactic Hegemony.

Work with the members of your crew to thrive despite powerful criminal syndicates, warring noble families, dangerous aliens, and strange mystics. Explore the ruins of lost civilizations for fun and profit. Can your motley crew hold it together long enough to strike it big and insure your fame across the sector?”

SESSIONS: There will be 4 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

DURATION: Each session is 3 hours.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Three players in addition to the facilitator. Two seats held - Daniel H and Agatha C.

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy, Stars &amp; Wishes. The game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

VENUE/TECH: Zoom Video, Roll20 for character sheets, etc. Expect an email one week before the first session with the Roll20 link, and another an hour or so before each session.

BREAKS: Two 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

RECORDING: Sessions will be recorded, but would only be posted with full enthusiastic player consent.  Currently the plan is to record only for the facilitator’s reference.

PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: None – rules will be taught in play.
