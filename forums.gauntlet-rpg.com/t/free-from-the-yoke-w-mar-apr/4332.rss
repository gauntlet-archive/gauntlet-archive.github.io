This is for the first four of nine sessions of *Free from the Yoke*. Being able to attend each session is strongly encouraged. Right now, I’m just posting the March sessions. Players in March will have right of first refusal to the April sessions. When a new player joins, they will take over the House of the previous player. Rules will be taught and the first session will be House, Character, and World set up.

You’ve won your revolution. What will you do with freedom? After occupation and revolution, your nation is finally free. Now you need to decide what happens next. Will you work with your fellow citizens to build a glorious new land, or forge your own path?

In *Free From the Yoke,* you’ll control one of 4 different Houses. These are the factions that define your new country, and through their struggles and fortunes you’ll tell your fledgling nation’s history.

You’ll also play a viewpoint Character from your House, however. Their adventures and sagas, their brushes with the supernatural and their desperate struggle on the battlefield, will help guide the course of history.

Finally, there’s the Arbiter – the organisation in control of this land. They might be the heroes of the revolutionary war, avatars of the Land itself risen up to oust the Empire, or even a governor left here by the Empire as part of their peace treaty with you. Their playbook tells you what sort of challenges they’ll force onto their subjects, what laws they’ll enforce, and how your Houses and Characters can exploit their organisation to their advantage. The Arbiter also has an Agent, a powerful free agent to add into your mix when characters go on adventures, and Projects – map-changing ambitions that will define each age of your saga.

We will be using Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
