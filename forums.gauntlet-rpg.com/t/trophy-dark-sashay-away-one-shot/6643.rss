    <description>One spot in this game is saved for a player (and Drag Race fan) not on the Gauntlet.

*She already done had hearses...*  In this incursion for the rules-light dark fantasy game Trophy Dark, you play a doomed drag queen competing on a gruelling reality TV show. The winner can expect fame, free makeup, youtube hosting gigs and a lifetime of lucrative performance opportunities as well as a 100,000 gold cash prize. But to win, you must convince the terrifying, ancient  *thing*  that rules the contest you deserve it, and not either of your competitors. Who will be crowned Kalduhr’s next drag superstar... and what will be left of them?

No rules knowledge is required, but familiarity with RuPaul’s Drag Race is desirable. 

This game will include elements of psychological and body horror, as well as violence and some gore, and a lot of reality TV tropes. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door policy as safety tools, and the game will run according to the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

You don’t need to know any rules, which will be taught during play. 

Sessions will be played on StreamYard, and only recorded with consent from all players. 

Open access time for signups will be 11.25 March 7, AEDT.
