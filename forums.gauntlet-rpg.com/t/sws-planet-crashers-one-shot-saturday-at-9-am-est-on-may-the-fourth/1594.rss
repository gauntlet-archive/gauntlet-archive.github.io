    <description>**May the Fourth be with you!**

On May the Fourth, I&#39;ve got a real treat for you! I&#39;m going to run a one-shot of Planet Crashers set in the Star Wars universe. **BROADCAST LIVE ON YOUTUBE!**

Planet Crashers is a Tabletop RPG which puts players in control of galactic bounty hunters as they try to take down an Infamous outlaw. The goal of Planet Crashers it to pit the players against the GM in a comedic and over the top Galactic adventure.

*Planet Crasher successfully Kickstarted in 2017 and the game&#39;s nearly complete as I post this. It will be sent to the printer in May, so this is a chance to get an early peek.*

-------------------------------------
This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi), when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.

(in case you missed it above): **This game session will be BROADCAST LIVE ON YOUTUBE!!!**
This session is scheduled for 2.5 hours.
