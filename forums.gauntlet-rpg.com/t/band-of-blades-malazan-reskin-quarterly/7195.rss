    <title>Band of Blades (Malazan Reskin) Quarterly</title>

    <description>**This is a 13 session run of Band of Blades, a Forged in the Dark game of military fantasy, that will be played on Saturdays through September, October and November 2021. This series will not use the original world of the base game but will be hacked / reskinned for the world of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Erikson.**

A knowledge of the Malazan world would be preferred but is not required. Same with being able to attend each session. That would be ideal but this game works reasonably well in the open table format. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

Prior experience isn&#39;t required, all rules will be taught in play. The game will not be recorded. We will use Streamyard for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils, the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) and the Open Table safety tools.

Content Warning: As a game of military fantasy, themes of death, war, suffering and to a lesser extent, body horror, are unavoidable.

*About Band of Blades:* Band of Blades is a game powered by Blades in the Dark about the surviving remnants of a once-storied army, now trying to survive and retreat to a safe location after a disastrous battle. There are military tactics, bold missions, battles against undead, horrific magics, and soldiers fighting for, dying for, and caring for each other. We play to find out if the undead army that so demolished them will finish the job. Or if this band of blades will be able to retreat to safety where they can regroup and potentially save humanity.

*About Malazan Book of the Fallen* : This is a 10 book epic fantasy series. It&#39;s a masterpiece of the genre. The author is an archaeologist and a student of literary tragedy and both these details are evident in the series. The worldbuilding is specifically rich and deep but at the same time, can be extremely frustrating in the way that the author often evades concrete details.
