    <title>Running Ultraviolet Grasslands: Which System?</title>

    <description>Which system would you use to run UVG with if you don&#39;t want to use SEACAT? 
The d40 hero table in the beginning makes me think **Whitehack** because you already have your vocation, affiliations etc spelled out for you ... but it&#39;s a roll under system so I would have to rewrite the Misfortune and Discovery tables in UVG where high = good. I watched a bit of @EricVulgaris actual play with **The Black Hack** and it didn&#39;t seem to work too smoothly with roll under.
Maybe **Freebooters** with 2d6 for the saving throws, d20+ modifier for all the caravan stuff and this awesome table for the techno-magical spells https://abominablefancy.blogspot.com/2017/06/an-exaltation-of-rockets.html ... but mixing two resolution systems is frowned upon with good reason and I don&#39;t think the classes really work.
My front runner at the moment is **Knave** which is classless ... but I would prefer some more heft for realizing different character concepts outside of the inventory system. 
So, what system would you use for UVG?</description>

              <p>I wholeheartedly agree: It would take a bit of fiddling - e.g. you would have to adjust the spell generation table for the electro wizard - but it can be done. We are deep into an ongoing campaign at the moment so I don’t feel like putting work into a Freebooters UVG hack but if I’d ever start a new campaign I’d consider giving it a try.</p>

              <p>I think the classic four classes can fit okay. Taking the Seacat hero types:</p>
<p>Cleric becomes Lifesculptor Biomancer<br>
Fighter becomes Timelost Warrior<br>
Magic user becomes Electric Wizard<br>
Thief becomes Freehold Archaeologist</p>
<p>I think all the races would easily be incorporated under UVG’s definition of humans, which includes dwarves, half-elfs, half-lings, and lots more.</p>

              <p>FontF was my first choice initially, I love the game to bits and it has exploration and travelling baked into the system. It even has trading rules! As with other D&amp;D inspired fantasy games - like Black Hack - that I also considered I wasn’t sure how to implement the science fantasy flavour of UVG. Wizard Fighter Thief and Cleric don’t sound like UVG characters and even if you have sort of Halflings, Elves and Dwarves in UVG they are nothing like your typical fantasy species the way they are portrait or at least hinted at in Freebooters (feather like step for Elves/ bonus for Dwarves being underground etc).</p>

              <p>Agreed <a class="mention" href="/u/haladir">@Haladir</a>: I’m leaning back toward SEACAT after spending the weekend poking at alternatives. It’s feeling vaguely <em>Cypher</em>-esque in some ways, but without the frustrations I have with that game engine. Example: <em>Numenera</em> has a <strong>wonderful</strong> setting but combat feels way too much like modern D&amp;D. The major remaining obstacle, I think, are the spells, but I might use a random generation system like that in <em>Freebooters on the Frontier</em> or <em>Maze Rats</em>, or just bringing over arcana / oddities from <em>Into the Odd</em>.</p>

For Into the Odd or Electric Bastionland, you’d probably want to look carefully at how to hand out arcana / oddities, and in the specific case of EB it would almost certainly require new failed careers.</p>

<p>The “Advanced Backgrounds” idea will be an option that will take the “split playbook” idea from <em>Uncharted Worlds</em> or <em>Spirit of '77</em>. That would let you play something a bit more exotic, like a Cat-Lord, Ultra, Vome, sentient animated skeleton, polybody, etc.</p>
<p>This also meshes well with Luka’s in-development OSR-inspired SEACAT game system that uses a similar “Skeleton/Skin” system. [I’d link to that document, but it’s behind a Patreon paywall.]</p>

              <p>Nice! I’m curious about how you design the playbooks. Will it be specific archetypes that might be typical for the UVG - let’s say a Bonecrafter with bonecrafting spells (whatever they are) or more like modular ones where you can pick options similar to the Background / Career combo in Uncharted Worlds? (That way you could maybe realize the idiosyncratic Backgrounds that are one of the strength of the setting.) Also, will there be race options (Cat-Lords, Ultras etc) similar to Elf, Halfling etc from DW or will they be separate playbooks? In any case I’m super interested in the project!</p>

<p>I found the inventory management in Troika to be a good fit, and the whacky backgrounds also blended into UVG pretty well.</p>

              <p>Interesting, after revisiting skerples’ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l9tZWtkGLp7XL9N0YibQY5UToSRHGaoA/view" rel="nofollow noopener">UVG hack for GLOG</a> I’m about to just use Whitehack with roll under for everything and Stat +modifier for caravan stuff but I would really prefer a unified system - not so much to keep the 20 special but to have high = good / low = bad as a basic rule. I don’t think Whitehack has the powerful opponent rule, though, but that could easily be implemented. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>

              <p>I remember seeing a review by Ben Milton on his youtube channel. Looks really good. I love the Darkest Dungeon vibe, the three stats (like Maze Rats / Into the Odd) and that characters are highly customizable but I don’t think the grimdark tone fits the weirdness of the Grasslands.</p>

              <p>I do believe there was discussion back in the G+ days about roll over as an alternate method for black hack / white hack.</p>
<p>You’d be rolling 1d20+STAT (the whole thing) over a target of 21. You’d either add the powerful opponents mod to the target of 21 or subtract it from the roll.</p>
<p>So if you had a STR of 15 you’d be rolling 1d20+15 for STR tests and would be trying to beat 21.<br>
If it was melee and the opponent had 3HD higher than your own then the target number goes up to 24 (or instead you could subtract 3 from the roll and keep the 21 as the target).</p>
<p>The odds are the same vs the roll under method, you keep 20s special, and everything is unified (high rolls are good).</p>

              <p>Five Torches Deep, Knave, and Old School Essentials are not just my favorites, but they have a lot going for them for this specific effort. Arguably, of those, I’d think FTD is probably the “easiest” for most people to get on board with, still have that old school flair, and has room for a little extra meat beyond Knave and similar lite systems.</p>

              <p>I really like <em>Knave</em> so I’d second that suggestion as well. (<em>Into the Odd</em> and any <em>Basic D&amp;D</em> flavor would probably work well too.) In general I think adding to a system is easier than trying to tear out and modify pieces of it (though both approaches can work well.)</p>
<p>My guess is you can take whatever you like best and graft UVG onto it but if your players aren’t already familiar with one or the other it’s true they might find it a bit confusing</p>

              <p>I played UVG using <a href="https://narrativedynamics.itch.io/mutagen-trail-picaresque">Mutagen Trail</a>, which I helped develop.  It’s a drift from d20 pass/fail resolution, but it’s got great support for travel in a strange wastelands.  It might be a good fit if you’re looking for something character-driven, with resolution that tends toward compromise and narrative momentum.</p>
