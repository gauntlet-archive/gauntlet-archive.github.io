    <description>While watching &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; last night, I was thinking about Rich Rogers&#39; &quot;Star Wars Saturdays&quot; and wondering about doing the same thing for Star Trek.

I&#39;ve always liked Star Wars, but my true love in fandom has always been Star Trek. 

What are some different RPGs that would be good to hack to tell various kinds of stories in the Star Trek universe? 

Some that I thought of...

* Apocalypse Warp: Play as the people in and around Zephrym Cochrane&#39;s hardhold as he tries to build a functioning warp drive. Scrounge for supplies and fight off raiders in the post-Eugenics War wasteland on late 21st century Earth.

* Trophy Dark: The Dead Cube: A group of latinum-motivated scoundrels and mercenaries loot an apparently-disabled Borg ship. What could posdibly go wrong?

* Comrades: Free Bajor! A cell of Bajoran freedom fighters plot revolution against their Cardassian overlords.

* Alienhearts: Starfleet Academy

* Psi Run: Androids on the run from both Federation officials and the Romulan secret police.

Any other ideas?</description>

              <p>I know my problem, with myself, when playing in star trek is…I’m not as smart as the writers of the tv shows I love, and then half the time, anytime there is a threat (on TNG on the Enterprise), it’s just been dealt with before the threat arises.</p>
<p>Like when Matt Frewer tried to kidnap Data back to the past, but the ships computer had already disabled the phaser he had in his hand.</p>

<p>It wasn’t perfect and it might not have felt mechanics light, but it wasn’t an overly complex game to play — again, that might just be down to faded recollection. I do have all but one of the supplements and adventures for the original game, so it clearly had an impact on me.</p>
<p>I can also thoroughly recommend Task Force Games <em>Prime Directive</em>, which was an interesting take on the Starfleet Battles Univerise — as near as you might get to <em>Star Trek</em> without being actually Star Trek.</p>

              <p>I’ve only seen that the FASA Trek game had a reasonable amount of success and was reviewed well.  From my experience with games of that era (things like “Swordbearer” come to mind) I bet it’s a bit rules heavy in petty ways.  It feels like the AD&amp;D influence was pretty pervasive back then – though perhaps I’m being unfair to Gygax who explicitly rejects simulation [not the Forge version] in the DMG, but then he also constantly adds fiddly rules for things like disease transmission.</p>
<p>One thing I like about pre-AD&amp;D rulesets and a lot of the contemporary ones that fall into the rules-light category (both in the post-OSR and indie/story scene) is an acceptance that mechanical detail and complexity come at a cost of player mental space/attention and so too much emphasis on mechanical fidelity, specifics or constant appeals to randomness can detract from the game a fair bit.</p>
<p>While I don’t think Mothership would work well for the tone of the Original Series, Next Gen or Even DS-9 I suspect it might be a sci-fi system that folks interested in indie/story play would like.  It lacks a narrative bent, but it’s clean and simple and the rules have an intentionality and utility that make it do what it says – which is admittedly to run the movie “Alien” and similar sci-horror scenarios.</p>

<p>Goblinoid Games produced a retro-clone Starships &amp; Spacemen which I’ve played, and it was pretty alright, simple enough rules.</p>

              <p>Oh, wow, there are many possibilities!</p>
<p>(This is where I pause to note that the current officially-licensed game, <em>Star Trek Adventures,</em> is actually pretty great, if crunchier than what we generally tackle on The Gauntlet.  It’s totally what I’d play if I wanted any sort of extended campaign that felt like any of the ongoing series.)</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> the Trophy Dark idea. The other Borg thing you could do story game-style would be to hack Zombie World to play on a colony world that was already partially assimilated.</p>
<p><em>Star-Crossed</em> suggests playing a passionate starship captain and logially-minded science officer right there on the box.</p>
<p>A thorough hack of <em>Band of Blades</em> for the Dominion War?</p>
<p>It’d be super-easy to skin <em>Our Last Best Hope</em> for saving some planet from gravimetric disruption or it star going supernova or whatever.</p>
<p>You could just add the serial numbers back on to <em>Hearts Blazing</em> for a fun evening of basically making up short fan-fic episodes of the show.</p>
<p>All the Klingon succession stuff is my own personal least favorite part of the show, but it’d be pretty easy to outline a frame for <em>The Chancellor (King) is Dead</em> and have plenty of batleth-swinging fun.</p>
<p><em>Misspent Youth</em> for Mirror Universe Terran Empire teens. Imagine the ‘psych exams’ at that version of Starfleet Academy…</p>
<p>Man, now I want to spin up that ongoing STA campaign more than ever.</p>

              <p>Unless I am misunderstanding the OP (Happens to me a lot lately) the idea is not to find one game “suitable for campaign play” and play it a lot, but rather to find a bunch of different games that aren’t “obviously” Star Trek and run Star Trek related material in them?</p>
<p>I don’t have any suggestions right now though, my creative is not powered up.</p>
