You are Friend.

There is Battle.
There is Train.
There is Love.

These are what You know:

If use Train to do Battle, can acquire Love.
But if Train doing Battle poorly, becoming Hate.
And if Hate, then Sad! Defeating.

World problems,
but Love with Friends always overcoming,
Especially when Trains.

Your mission:

Make Friends.
Have Battle.
Do Train.
Be Love.

I&#39;m running a series of one-shots of a game I&#39;m developing called Battle Train. The sessions will not be recorded. Please only sign up for one of the sessions on offer. Unless you really, really want to play both. In which case okay!

Battle Train is a game about battle and train, but also love. If you&#39;re interested in some over-the-top, lightspeed-stupid fun involving battle, trains, love, birds, tables of random outcomes, train-based everything (startups, food carts, fashion shows) and possibly Jeff Goldblum (the actor, not the sentient refrigerator) then today&#39;s your lucky day!

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play. We&#39;ll use the X-Card and Lines and Veils for safety.
