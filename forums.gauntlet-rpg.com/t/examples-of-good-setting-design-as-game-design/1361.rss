    <title>Examples of Good Setting Design as Game Design</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/examples-of-good-setting-design-as-game-design/1361</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a big fan of using setting design to shape the game in an unobtrusive way, so that the shape of the fiction naturally makes the game flow a certain way. The best example of this I have is from larp, the way Harry Potter has accidentally excellent larp setting design, as seen in College of Wizardry and similar games. The way Harry Potter organizes it&#39;s world doubles as good larp design, and thus gives games a lot of structure.

**I&#39;m looking for examples of good setting design that does something similar. What games do you think have good setting design specifically in terms of setting design doubling as game design?**

A trpg example that comes to mind is Blades in the Dark and the way every single detail in the setting is geared towards exactly the kind of action the game is about.

For me, the creative goal here is that if parts of the design can be sunk into the setting&#39;s structure, it takes away pressure from mechanics.</description>

<p>That’s from golden age SF, particularly the Flandry series by Poul Anderson. Traveller and it’s setting were already in development when Star Wars came out so it’s primary inspirations predate it.</p>

              <p>Ok, a few examples of setting design as game design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In-world factions with niche protection such as Vampire clans in VTM with special clan specific powers, or Cults in RuneQuest that grant special role-relevant magic. Compare to classes, which are purely game mechanical constructs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reality rules.  A sword is a sword in any setting, but what magic is available and how it works is part of the setting, but that can be whatever you like and affects gameplay a lot, so it’s both setting design and game design. The same goes for superpowers, psi, etc but also the technology in SF games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sources of Conflict. What’s the core activity for the characters? Who are the factions, allies, enemies, rivalries and activities for the characters? These are really important in generating action which feeds directly into what happens at the table. An example would be having an actual in world reason for having dungeons everywhere.</p>

              <p>I had totally forgotten the badges, but they’re exactly the sort of thing that doesn’t help me; They’re a “mechanical” process that evokes SOMETHING about the setting, but which doesn’t go the other way and ends up feeling like a weird mechanical dead end.</p>
<p>So I feel like Ghost Lines has good “setting design” insofar as it is very evocative for the VERY small amount of space it has, but unless you’re prepared to fill in A LOT OF STUFF about a world that is incredibly foreign, it’s not actually usable, and it’s definitely not, for me, an example of setting-design-as-game-design.</p>
<p>As for what kind of ‘tools’ I want, I think we’re wandering off topic here.  I’m not looking for mechanical tools to enforce or evoke the setting, or is this thread about that.  What I feel is missing from Ghost Lines is enough anything to allow me to understand how this world works.  But that’s not a ‘setting design as game design’ issue either, so I don’t know that trying to unpack it (note: This is an area that I am not necessarily very good at quantifying) is even on-topic here.</p>

              <p>I really want to mention <em>Spire: The City Must Fall</em>’s setting here, <a class="mention" href="/u/juhanaonparas">@juhanaonparas</a>. It’s chock-full of charged situations and opposed factions that get you into the game’s weird headspace. (Like <em>Unknown Armies,</em> <em>Spire</em> runs on a very particular aesthetic.)</p>
<p>The game’s mile-high city (which is a huge metaphor for economic and cultural stratification) mechanizes your level of privilege: Want to lord it over the desperate denizens of Derelictus, near the base of Spire? That’s probably only D3 stress. Act the same way around your high elf overlords in Amaranth high above? You’re looking at D8 stress.</p>
<p>But after rereading your question, it feels like <em>Spire</em> is the inverse of what you’re looking for: It sinks its setting into its mechanics.</p>
<p>This comes out particularly in the way the classes are designed as deeply embedded in particular locations and organizations: If you want to know how the Blue Port actually functions as a market and a place, you’re better off reading the Azurite’s skill list than the entry in the book.</p>
<p>Delightful as the game’s setting is to read, it feels like a mess of loose threads that need the input of players and GMs to tense into something actionable. (This might also be a plus in relation to the reason you’re asking the question, because players have a lot of setting information right in front of them from character creation on).</p>

<p>Having said that, I loved the openness that it had as a setting… you had to just make up whatever you wanted (and I included a crazy-quilt of worlds plucked from FASA adventures, traveller ‘amber zone’ settings from the journal, and whatever else took my fancy <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It’s mostly expressed in tables and procedural generation, but you get a world where ideal planets are rare, authority is distant, and opportunities for profit abound. There’s a lot of harmony there where the generated universe provides fictional fodder that plugs directly into the mechanics of a session.</p>

Ideally, in PbtA, the mechanics should be invisible until the point in a narrative where it is unclear where the fiction should go — then the dice are rolled not as a resolution mechanic per se but as, like, a way to automate the “choose your own adventure” aspect of emergent fiction.</p>

              <p>I think good OSR modules do this by having bespoke mechanics built into certain game situations. We increasingly see modules like <em>Silent Titans</em> that are a game system built into a game setting. There are also modules like <em>The Gardens of Ynn</em> that are basically procgen engines built with one very specific setting in mind. I have tried to follow this setting-driven approach in the modules I’ve written as well.</p>
<p>In my opinion <em>Blades</em> tried to do a setting-driven design, but it ended up pushing more towards a setting-agnostic design in the interest of being very hackable. In that sense it was hugely successful, but I think the number of people who say “I like the system, but I don’t care for Doskvol” shows that they’re not as integrated as they might otherwise be.</p>

              <p>Sorry to dig up an old thread, but…</p>
<p>I’d also add <em><strong>The Clay that Woke</strong></em> by Paul Czege to the list of games that blend setting, themes, and rules.  It has some really great prose sections that are written like a novel, but they cover the kinds of actions that the characters would normally do.</p>
<p>Then, the text gives explicit rules for how to resolve dramatic actions. Then, it dives back into novel-like prose. Then, sprinkled in the prose are kind-of asides about how the rules mechanize the themes. The text is trying (successfully, I would add, I’ve run it a few times) to <em><strong>inspire</strong></em> you to play the game, rather than being an inventory of the tools used to play.</p>

              <p>I would nominate Fiasco for this. No, it’s not a setting as in a specific time and place, but if the setting is “in a Coen bros or Tarantino movie,” then yeah.</p>
<p>The game borrows the structure of these films in a really brilliant way, understands the characters and what makes them up, what makes the stories interesting, etc. Every roll and every action in the game only makes sense because we understand these “job gone wrong” tropes.</p>

              <p>Maybe I should open up that a little more, and the reason why I started this thread. My specific player community has a lot of folks who don’t really want to engage with game mechanics while playing roleplaying games. Because of this, I’ve been thinking a lot about the question of how to make games that are accessible and approachable for this type of player.</p>
<p>As a solution, I started to think it would be desirable to build as much of the game’s structure and mechanics into other areas of the design, such as setting, visuals, genre, and how the progression of play is explained. This way, a player can grasp much of how a game works from understanding the world and the role of the characters in it.</p>
<p>I then started to think about different existing games and how their worlds are designed, whether I could learn from them.</p>

It’s quite economical in the sense that there isn’t too much to read but thanks to the beautiful visuals the world really comes alive.</p>

              <p>Fall of Magic looks absolutely lovely. I’ll have to see if I can scourge up a copy. With this question of settings, I’m trying to figure out how much design could really be crammed into the setting. The larp example of Harry Potter and College of Wizardry suggests that potentially quite a lot.</p>
<p>A characteristic of “big settings” seems to be that they’ve served so many purposes that the design is not really inherent anymore. For example, reading a Forgotten Realms book, I don’t think it automatically provides the framework of a D&amp;D game. It needs the mechanics.</p>
<p>(Or maybe I just remember the Volo’s Guide series so vividly that my view of a Forgotten Realms adventure is mainly about comparing bards, taverns and festhalls on a kind of a fantasy pub crawl.)</p>
