    <description>Hey, folks-

I did one of those question-a-day things on Twitter that&#39;s about running games so that the folks who put in all those hours but maybe aren&#39;t (principally) designers also get recognized and get to share their thoughts.

In case you&#39;re not on Twitter, or just don&#39;t want to broadcast your answers into the great Twitter maelstrom! , I&#39;m posting it here, so let&#39;s make a big, huge,month-long thread with the answers!

<li>What’s the first game you remember organizing/GMing?</li>
</ol>
<p>After playing an AD&amp;D/OD&amp;D hybrid for a few months in a group where I was the youngest kid by far, I started feeling a little weird about it, and quit. About a year later, I started my own D&amp;D group with some of my own friends, usuing the brand-new Tom Moldvay D&amp;D Basic Set. (1983). I bought the set with money I’d earned on my paper route.</p>

<p>I’m Sabine. I live in southwestern Germany. I’ve been playing &amp; running ttrpgs since the late '80s, work as a data coordinator (or whatever we’re calling ourselves these days) at a law firm and like to hike and take pictures of everything that strikes my fancy. Right now, I should be in bed, but I’d rather procrastinate.</p>
<p>I’ve done some editing &amp; translating for German RPGs (Unknown Armies, Fate, Fiasco, Cheat Your Own Adventure), and I’m hoping to do some more stuff.</p>

<p>Mike Ferdinando. I’ve been going by “Haladir” on Internet messageboards since before the World Wide Web was a thing. I’ve been playing and running RPGs since the early 1980s. I’m an IT manager in higher ed. I’ve been married for more than 20 years. It’s a mixed-marriage: my spouse is not a gamer. (I think it’s healthy for partners to have some separate interests.)</p>
