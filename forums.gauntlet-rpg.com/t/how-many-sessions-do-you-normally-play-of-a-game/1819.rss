    <description>Or... so many games so little time! 

How many sessions do you tend to play of a setting in a single ‘campaign’?

If it’s say 8 or less how well does contemporary game design achieve this? Give me some good examples of those games</description>

              <p>One of the groups I game with mostly does a mix of one shots and 2-3 session arcs. We mostly do this for scheduling reasons and to be able to try lots of games. I’ve preferred to schedule 3-6 session arcs for games I run. I used to play in campaigns without a planned end date, but at this point it’s hard to get people to commit to games that will run a long time (or indefinitely).</p>

              <p>At our game night we alternate between one-shots open to all-comers, and longer campaigns for our core group of 4-6 players. We’ve done a handful of 3-5 session runs, but the most memorable have been the longer campaigns we’ve played to completion, each of which (a fantasy PbtA hack, the Dracula Dossier using a home brew PbtA system, and Blades in the Dark) lasted 30+ sessions. In my experience there’s no substitute for the epic scale, character development, and depth of a long-term campaign, so even though we mix it up and have fun week to week, everyone always wants to know what the “next big thing” is going to be.</p>

We don’t set the number of sessions beforehand but, so far, the shortest game lasted for 3 sessions and the longest 6, if I remember correctly.</p>

              <p>I like to join Gauntlet Hangouts games that run for 2–4 sessions, figuring that’s the most I can commit to for an online game on a weeknight right now. I did play in one <em>Cold Ruins of Lastlife</em> campaign that booked in four-session slots each month and ultimately ran for something like 10–12 sessions, and it was excellent—but I probably would’ve been too skittish to sign up if I knew from the start it was going to run for so long!</p>
<p>For face-to-face games, my answer varies a lot more. I probably run more one-shots than anything else, and often use these to try out games I’ll likely never play again. I’ve run a few longer arcs over the years, though; just before my kid was born a couple years back, I ran about 10–13 sessions of <em>Urban Shadows,</em> about 6 sessions of a <em>Dungeon World</em> campaign, about 6 sessions of <em>The Flux,</em> and just a few sessions each of some hacks I made based on World of Dungeons and Fate Accelerated. Most recently, I’ve gotten about 8 or so sessions so far of one of my own games I’m playtesting, and I’m hoping my next game will be a 5–10 session arc of <em>Silent Titans, Invisible Sun, Phoenix: Dawn Command, Mutant: Year Zero, Night’s Black Agents,</em> or some other game that looks especially well built for multi-session play.</p>
<p>I don’t really do “ongoing and open-ended” games anymore, since I find that tends to just mean “fizzles out disappointingly.”</p>

              <p>I mostly play PbtA games and do a fair bit of one shots, so that’s y’know, one session (or two when we inevitably run out of time and have to wrap it up later), but when we do like “full” campaigns, I think the game sort of naturally lends itself to wrapping everything up after a few months to half a year or so, playing roughly weekly. At that point, if people have stuck with their initial characters, they’re tending to get a good chunk of their advancements, are into the special late game advancements, and have probably pretty fully experienced whatever they wanted to get out of that character, so the systems tend to reach their natural end point.</p>
<p>I’ll also say, slightly to what <a class="mention" href="/u/ericvulgaris">@EricVulgaris</a> said about D&amp;D campaigns’ length, I’ve been in multiple D&amp;D groups trying to play for that forever campaign that’ll just go on for years, and they’ve all died off prematurely within a year or less, so I’m definite a big fan of shooting for the tighter months-long story with a game that pushes the fiction faster.</p>

              <p>Steve, I definitely felt that the two-shot was the perfect length for a really satisfying <em>Hearts of Wulin</em> game. I don’t think I’d try to do it as a one-shot without really boiling down the setup.</p>
<p>I play pretty much exclusively on The Gauntlet these days, which means runs of 3-5 games. I’ve just put up my first long campaign, for <em>Night Witches</em>, that’ll run over several consecutive months, and I’m also running <a class="mention" href="/u/frasersimons">@Frasersimons</a> <em>Uncanny Echo</em> in the full ten-game series over 2 months (May and July) so we’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>Back when the store was open we’d run quarterly campaigns of D&amp;D that we’d wrap after a dozen sessions. We got some grumbling form people who wanted Eternal Campagins, but we found it worked pretty well given that we wanted to cycle in new players and GMs.</p>
<p>For my own self-indulgent long-running campaigns, I found that even with stuff we could play forever in a friend group, like Marvel Heroic or Star Trek, we’d want to swap out the heroes every six months or so.</p>

              <p>Over at the <a href="https://www.mk-rpg.org.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">Milton Keynes RPG club</a> we have a long-standing cycle of eight-session “long” games and three sessions of 1-3 session games. That works very well for us: enough time to get into characters, but not enough to allow the game to drift.</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s typically one group playing though a year-long Call of Cthulhu campaign, and sometimes another group playing through a many-month D&amp;D campaign.</p>

              <p>My primary in person game meets roughly weekly, taking off some weeks. We’ve got right around 3 hours, and need games to fit into that slot. We’ll run the same game for three months usually, so call it ~10 sessions.</p>
<p>We’re now doing Blades, and getting a hold of the system has taken a session or two. There’s a lot going on, and it’s good to have the runway.</p>

              <p>Depends on the game.</p>
<p>I usually set out to do a “pilot” campaign and negotiate from there. “let’s agree to play 5 sessions and option for more if we wanna continue.”</p>
<p>I’m a streamer of ttrpgs because I love having records of my games and letting others see that ttrpgs aren’t just for the Matt mercers of the world and its ok to just be mediocre like me! But a streamed game requires more commitment than an irl game, in my opinion, so agreeing to a shorter series of games for consecutive weeks is necessary. That being said I still do the pilot pitch thing for my irl games too.</p>
<p>I can tell you as an analyst for roll20, the majority of dnd campaigns barely make it a year of irl time. I haven’t drilled into the data enough yet for more clarity. Assuming a group meets weekly for a year, I’d expect 25/26 actual sessions. A weekly group actually meets about every two weeks on a yearly basis (Yay life/holidays <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:">). A general rule is to count the frequency of games in a year is to just half the scheduled frequency and factor in the 52 weeks.</p>

              <p>I enjoy one-shots, but after signing up for a couple of two-session “long con” games at Dreamation, I have the sense that, at least with PbtA games, a bit of extra length is an improvement. Enough time is spent on “session zero” material that a second session gives you maybe 150% more play time, and I felt the story benefitted as a result. People pushed harder on their character arcs because they knew they’d have time to wrap things up. I haven’t played enough two-session games to be sure, but I think that might be my sweet spot for PbtA, the length where we can tell a tight, moving story with strong character arcs and still wrap everything up in a satisfying way.</p>

              <p>My contention would be around things like advancement. You can play great stories in loads of games in 1 or 4 sessions. Something like the watch or masks comes to its true potential when you hit a bit more length.</p>
<p>There are 3 play states if you like - 1 shots, micro/mini series campaigns and long campaigns.</p>

              <p>My preferred game length is a 3-4 hour one-shot. I like to get in, hit it hard, and wrap up the experience.</p>
<p>Having played a great variety of games in 4-ish session series on the Gauntlet (and having listened to lots of similar-length games on podcasts like One Shot and She’s A Super Geek), I’m not seeing any evidence for the contention that modern games are not designed for that length. I can name a few games that seem to do better as longer campaigns (Urban Shadows, SCUP), but those seem to be the exceptions rather than the rule.</p>
<p>And on the other side, we have lots of games coming out now (such as Trophy and For The Queen) that are explicitly designed as one-shots.</p>
