    <description>Where the wave of moonlight glosses

The dim grey sands with light,

Far off by furthest Rosses

We foot it all the night,

Weaving olden dances,

Mingling hands and mingling glances

Till the moon has taken flight;

To and fro we leap

And chase the frothy bubbles,

While the world is full of troubles

And is anxious in its sleep.

Come away, O human child!

To the waters and the wild

With a faery, hand in hand,

For the world&#39;s more full of weeping than you

can understand.

~From William Butler Yeats &quot;The Stolen Child&quot;

This is five sessions of Vincent and Meguey Baker&#39;s Under the Hollow Hills, a game of fae performers putting on a circus for fairy and human folk across and between worlds.  The game will be played at 8 PM US eastern time Thursdays in July.  This game will explore themes of otherness, beauty, terror, the uncanny, the lies underneath our stories, and the truth we can tell with lies.  Key cultural touchstones include A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, the prints of William Blake, Little, Big by John Crowley, Neil Gaiman&#39;s The Sandman and as many fairy tales undomesticated by the Grimms and Perrault as I can muster.  It may confront issues of violence, sexuality, the inhumanity of humans and the humaneness of the inhuman. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.  The first session will be dedicated to creation of characters and the circus, and we will hopefully travel to our first show location.  The will be followed by four sessions of wandering fairyland and the mortal world, and perhaps spaces in between, putting on our show for all and sundry. 

 I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Rules will be taught. Sessions will run up to three and a half hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils, script change and the X-Card for safety tools.  A spot is being saved for Alexi Sargent
