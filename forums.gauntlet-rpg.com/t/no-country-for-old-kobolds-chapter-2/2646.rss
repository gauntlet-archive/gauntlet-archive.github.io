    <title>No Country for Old Kobolds - Chapter 2</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/no-country-for-old-kobolds-chapter-2/2646</link>
    <description>No Country for Old Kobolds is a game in which you explore the life of kobolds—small draconian humanoids who are almost always relegated to the lowest rung of society.

As kobold leaders and warriors, you’ll try to keep your village thriving at all costs, surviving a world full of hostile neighbors which we will define together in the first session.

Kobold life expectancy is short but worry not! You will play an entire lineage—if your kobold dies, you’ll carry on and play that kobold’s progeny.

This game can be depressing, it can be funny, and it can be dark. It’s usually a bit of each.

If everyone agrees (and if I can figure out how to record streams), I&#39;ll post these games on YouTube.

You don’t have to attend every session, just the ones you RSVP for.
