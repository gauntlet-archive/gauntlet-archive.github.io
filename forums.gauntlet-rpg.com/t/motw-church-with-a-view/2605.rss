    <description>Monster of the Week

                      Tome of Mysteries-A Church with a View

I will be running 2 sessions of MotW on alternating Saturdays, August 10th and 24th. These will be using the Tome of Mysteries playbooks and the More Weirdness magic rules. These will be recorded with rebroadcast with player approval.
                                              Church with a View
    Father Amhurst of St. George’s church has garnered a reputation for his
incendiary and hateful sermons. While repelling some parishioners, he
has also drawn in a number of fire and brimstone-minded churchgoers.
Whipped into a frenzy of abhorrent condemnation, the congregation
has unknowingly caught the attention of otherworldly things.

The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy will be in effect and the X-Card will be on the table, We will do a Lines and Veils before session 1. I do want a creepy, dark game. Come have some horrific fun with me.
