    <description>on 4th of may this year i&#39;ll be running three sessions of Scum and Villainy in the Star Wars setting.

When i announced the games i asked players to sign up for one session initially with all the remaining places opening up on the 17th.

The 17th is here and i have one player space left for the morning session.

The game will be run using Roll20. The game will run for 3 hours and use pre-generated characters.
