    <title>Playing Doomed Characters</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/playing-doomed-characters/1223</link>
    <description>I have lately been running *a lot* of @jesseross&#39;s Trophy. It&#39;s a game about a group of treasure-seekers going on an expedition to the heart of a forest that does not want them there. The game focuses heavily on psychological horror and the fact that the characters are doomed. By the end, they are either dead or irreparably broken. 

I talked about my experience with the game here at 03:32:21: 
https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-gauntlet-podcast/forbidden-lands-spire-rpg-trophy-hiltblade

What I find most fascinating about Trophy is how knowing the players are doomed affects the way you play them. In my experience with it, players really lean into playing up the paranoia, the betrayal, the basic brokenness of the characters precisely because they know the characters are doomed. The game makes space for that kind of fun, essentially. (Trophy is a very bleak game, to put it mildly.)

A few things:
1) I&#39;m curious to hear about other games that start with the players knowing the characters are doomed. 
2) How does knowing the characters are doomed affect the way you play? 
3) I find this sort of thing to be very enjoyable—it&#39;s my kind of fun—but I&#39;m curious to hear how you feel, generally, about playing in that kind of bleak space. 

If anyone wants to check out Trophy, the core game is available in Codex - Dark 2, which can be found here: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/268198/Codex--Dark-2-Dec-2018?term=codex+dark+2

New Trophy add-ons come out every month in Codex.</description>

              <p>Characters in Dialect are not necessarily doomed, but in our games they usually end up this way, and the fact that the Isolation is, indeed, doomed creates GREAT moments. One of my best role play experiences was when, during our first session of Dialect, in age two or three, my character (the leader) was telling the others that our gang will surely survive (we played with Thieves Cant backdrop).<br>
So, I’m explaining that we will surely survive all this, and the player who played the Oracle archetype just looks at me. I look at her. She gives me the slightest of nods and I had no doubt that it said “I know that you know that you’re bullshiting them, and I approve of it, cause there’s nothing that we can do now.”<br>
There’s no way it would have played that way if we as players didn’t know that our group won’t survive.</p>

              <p>there is a recurring theme in the games of Fiasco I’ve played in that i’ve yet to have a character live to the end of the game.  I think character death and “the end” of a character is a narrative tool but what i dislike is “meaningless deaths” but then, i dont play many gritty games where that can occur often.</p>
<p>I think giving characters options on what they choose to have their characters die for or how their characters die is something i’d encourage in narrative games and indeed, it’s something i’ve encouraged in larps that i’ve ran, (one character did a stupidly courageous thing knowing he would die slowly in X sessions as a result) and this proved to be an excellent motivator for the character to get out and be more proactive in engaging the game and the world (in this case, the character wanted to make a difference before he passed)</p>

<p>I played a game of Nemesis 382 last year and it… wasn’t great. The problem was that the anticipated style of the game wasn’t made crystal clear up front. I was expecting an “Event Horizon” style descent into madness, another player was clearly seeing it More like Disneys “Black Hole” with problems to overcome, and a third player was keen on seeing the inherent humour in a situation with being a funny alien. I know that I’d check up front in future what kind of game something is intended to be!</p>

<p>I played a great game a couple of years ago laden with pathos when all the players stacked our hands to ensure that one of our number - the reluctant hero that the people needed - would survive.  The player who played that reluctant hero didn’t really realise quite what was going to happen and as character after character narrated how we died in the battle to ensure she survived we all felt a bit tearful (in a good way).</p>
<p>Joanna converted it into a LARP called Dawnstone I think which was similarly amazing.</p>

              <p>Just dropping in to mention Our Last Best Hope.  The PCs are a team of specialists trying to stop a world-ending threat, probably at the cost of all their lives.     They set up the collaboratively generated threats they will face.  Our Last Best Hope operates in that heroic sacrifice space, where the characters are doomed but maybe isn’t quite as bleak as some of the other games mentioned above.</p>

<p>I like the historical focus. But I wouldn’t categorize this as “doom” or “tragic” (in the greco-roman sense) though it is certainly emotional and heartwrenching. To me, doom or tradgedy implies the absence of meaning, or a death without purpose. Dying for a noble cause – to save innocent lives – is heroism. Reminiscent of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Scholl" rel="nofollow noopener">Sophie Scholl</a>. I look forward to to seeing this game.</p>

<p>I’ve mostly played one-shots in recent years, and I’ve always enjoyed the doomed trope most of all. It’s a bit like the movie Titanic - we all know the boat is going to sink, but there are interesting stories to be told along the way.</p>
<p>This approach has instructed the design of my current work in progress (due to Kickstart next month) <strong>A Cool and Lonely Courage</strong>. It’s set as a tragic story game, and right at the outset you know that you are women spies in WW2 France who have been captured by the Nazis and are facing execution. During the game a series of flashbacks reveal the highs and lows of their life leading up to the spot that they are in right now. Many will not survive, but all are remembered by someone. It’s designed to be an emotionally intense game, and the feedback that I’ve had from players is that it hits that design goal.</p>

<p>Reminds me a little of the Klingon philosophy of war, when the general says to his troops before boarding a ship: “we are already dead. We fight to regain our lives.”</p>
<p>Also wanted to throw out a mention of <em>Icarus</em>, where you don’t necessarily play a doomed character, but rather a character in a thriving civilization doomed to eventual collapse.

<li>Maybe the greatest escapism is to embody something that dies – but to still, yourself, continue beyond it.</li>
<li>There’s something alluring about knowing the fact of doom but not knowing how, when, or why it will happen. This is maybe the formula for just about every popular horror movie ever.</li>
<li>Doomed characters have you playing not so much to see what happens as much to see how it happens … I think this is partly why Trophy is so triumphant as a one-shot system: It adds focus to every action, and, as the clock ticks, pushes players to answer the fundamental question rather than raise a new one.</li>
<li>I come from strategy gaming, so my instinct is to play for optimal survival. The fun of not surviving is something unique to the ttrpg experience for me, and embracing it helps me subvert that impulse.</li>

              <p>Hell yeah. Doomed stuff is amazing. I’ll talk more about games that risk doom in a bit, but I first want to hop on about games with explicit doom.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to mind are a suite of games that really tell a tighter story than normal. By constraining the play experience to be explicitly framed as “you will lose” we play to find out HOW something happens rather than what something happens.</p>
<p>Three games come to mind I want to share.</p>
<ol>
<li>Downfall - The Hobbs’ game about a society and a doomed reformer (GMless)</li>
<li>Polaris - Romantic tragedy of chivalrous knights of the frigid, starlit north pole. (GMless)</li>
<li>Lovecraftesque - Collaborative storytelling of lovecraftian narratives (GMless)</li>
</ol>
<p>All three games here really almost free you playing them by pushing really hard to avoid the inevitable tragedy. Often we as players have a lot more control in these narrative games over how things respond to the character (rather than say D&amp;D where we don’t have a choice how we respond to the 10d6 fireball), so our inevitable march to death, doom, and/or tragedy is paced out in a pleasant matter. We don’t know what others will suggest of our characters but by the end of these games we all feel drained and amazed how evocative they can be.</p>
<p>Ok so now on to the other games. Games that really play with the idea of death at the forefront of the experience but don’t guarantee it. You’re not doomed, but you’re also not-not doomed. We play to find out if we survive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Moldvay D&amp;D (also DCC and a lot of other OSR retroclones)</li>
<li>Night Witches</li>
</ol>
<p>Older emulations and the real thing of older D&amp;D had higher body counts because the play experience was supposed to have the odds against you sort of feel. The death made the victories sweeter, sorta. In my time with these games, it lets us not really care too much about what are characters eat, think about, or dream of. We don’t know how they complain about the awkward length of their chainmail. Instead we’re worried about the door and the sounds of orcs. You focus on the now. The life and death. The more you survive, the more we build a legacy. Your characters stand on their pedestals of accomplishments. From surviving in the present, you begin to care about their past. So when a single hit from an orc will crush us, but if I go first my own axe could do just as well-- there’s a gunfighter exhilaration when playing so close to death.</p>
<p>Night Witches is a game that I bring up because that game also has a high death count, but it’s not the same as old D&amp;D. It’s just as lethal but that game we DO as players sorta get in the heads of our characters and worry about how they dress, who they love, as well as if they just survive from the get-go. But the juxtaposition of Night Witches being a game about a community and war makes it so great. The stakes are too great personally and professionally. Great game. In my NW campaign, we had one PC survive the whole thing from mission 1. She eventually became a jaded, emotional wreck of a commander, never flying missions herself, but teaching the new recruits and giving them the mission directives. One of my favorite campaigns of a game, ever.</p>
<p>3:16 is another game that isn’t on the list above, but apparently military RPGs really play with that doom question, don’t they?</p>

              <p>Like many people here, I enjoy playing doomed characters as well. On the one hand, you can just let go of the brakes and drive your character as hard as possible against a wall they can’t even see, and that is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>But even stronger is the struggle a character might put up even though they know they’re doomed, and maybe that don’t even fight to be un-doomed but to achieve one specific goal even though they are going down. This glimmer of hope, of something better amidst all the desperation is really the beat I want to hit - bitter, but with a slight touch of sweetness that makes it even worse, because I like to root for my characters.</p>

              <p>I feel like I should have something to say on this subject <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> although only one of my games has absolutely doomed characters (Midnight at the Oasis’s characters probably won’t change during the game but, uh, take it from me, some figure out a way later on.)</p>
<p>I think a great deal of the tension in Red Carnations comes from knowing that a) this will not end well and b) not knowing <em>who will die</em> even when you know that <em>half of the characters will</em>. And I’ve seen how people line up for that doom–you can often get a sense of who is not going to make it for at least some of the characters, although there’s always room for people to make a sudden decision right at the end.</p>
<p>And of course, part of the design is intentionally that you have to <em>choose</em> who dies but that does not save you; it’s entirely possible that random chance will grimly reap more of the characters. As a tensioning device, this works fine and keeps things tight right up to the end. (Have I mentioned that I’m looking for a trauma reader and some formal derolling exercises for the final text?)</p>
<p>All that said: I’ve seen some wonderful tragedy in Carnations; I’ve got a couple of character deaths that I portrayed and were gut-kickers. But without a doubt the most poignant, plot-effective, and tragic death happened in the (in)famous third session I facilitated at Dexcon 2018. On the last scene of Act II, Louise’s player decided to have Louise be killed randomly, out of the blue, by a falling artillery shell. And suddenly the game slanted sharply into darkness; the montage scenes were mostly reactions to her death and funeral, and Act III felt even more desperate than usual. (And then we had far more tragic stuff happen in the epilogue, but that’s another post.)</p>
<p>This kind of game is my jam too. I love Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne and of course Montsegur 1244. Shaping a tragic character arc means that you can invest your moments of hope with real intensity in my experience, counter-intuitive as that sounds. Maybe it’s the ironic distance, or the fact that to sell yourself on making your character believe they can still survive you have to really push yourself.</p>
<p>I will say aftercare is important. I had tears at RC when I ran it at Breakout; luckily we had some larpers who were good at doing deroling and we were able to walk off all right. Montsegur or Witch can have similar impact. I mean, it’s to be hoped everyone will be on the same page when you sit down to play, but you can never tell what might happen. (On a somewhat coincidental note, I just saw a Twitter thread that referenced “A Game of You” from Sandman, which I think is relevant–I mean, I was looking for melancholy tragedy and pointless death, after all, but then again I was also weeping uncontrollably at 3AM and feeling betrayed. So you never know.)</p>
