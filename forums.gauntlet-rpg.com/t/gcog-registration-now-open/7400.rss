    <title>GCOG Registration Now Open</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gcog-registration-now-open/7400</link>
    <description>Registration is now open for our next Gauntlet Community Open Gaming on Monday September 20th at 1200 Eastern time. The event happens October 14th-17th and everything&#39;s free. We do ask that community members limit themselves to one sign-up per day for the first week to give new players an opportunity. If you see or hear anyone posting about having problems signing up--  *message me* . There&#39;s a manual step to approving registrations. It only takes a moment, but I have to spot it when I check the site or when someone gives me a heads up.

It would really, really help if you could share info about the convention: tweet about it, post on Facebook, on Discords, Instragram, etc. It would be great to get the word out to folks who haven&#39;t played online and/or with us before.

The Event Listing is here: https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/events
