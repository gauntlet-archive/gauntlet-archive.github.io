    <description>I love PbtA and Forged in the Dark games but interested in other games with similar mechanics that are fiction first. 

Also bonus points for Dark Fantasy games. I just found Symbaroum and love the art and the atmosphere but the rules don’t seem to really deliver on it.</description>

              <p>I second <em>Spire.</em>. The setting is extremely dense and almost adds its own layer of ‘crunch,’ but damn do the rules get out of the way and just let PCs <em>GO</em>. I’d love to see more hacks of the Resistance Toolbox in pared-down settings.</p>
<p>Nathan D. Paoletta’s <em>Imp of the Perverse</em> (which I’m hopefully running next week) has an extremely focused core mechanic, but with lots of little rules and procedures that encourage interesting narrative. I think you could play it very serious and research-heavy or (with the right group) as a very pulpy, gory pick-up-and-play game. Either way, the rules seem spare and elegant.</p>

              <p>I really like how much attention Girl Underground gives to its premise and procedures. Resolution is straight-forward, and it gives a lot of guidance on starting a game, pushing for the interesting stuff, and brining things to a conclusion.</p>
<p>I have read plenty of “rules llight” games that essentially only provide character creation and dice resolution, offloading the big questions of premise and pacing onto the GM.  This is a reasonable streamlining (especially if the game can assume a lot of shared techniques with other systems) but I appreciate games like GU that are able to set clear procedures of play.</p>

              <p>I go with player empathy to decide. I can’t enjoy a system if the player’s don’t like it.</p>
<p>I like Into the Odd because you’re up and running with rookie players in minutes. It could use a social mechanic, and I like to add in encumbrance based on their Strength score since the game is about looting and paying down debt.</p>
<p>I love Lady Blackbird for its skills-as-class system. A player can be literally anything and not be hindered by a class system.</p>
<p>Maze Rats I really did for all of the d36 tables it includes, though it’s really hard. It retains the PBtA 2d6 + STAT system but only 10+ are successes; there’s no recognition for partial success. Easy enough to add back in, but if someone picks it up and goes by RAW it can be tough. I feel bad for anyone who picks the mage class though, since they only get one spell per day. The other two classes get bonuses to all rolls in their domain.</p>
<p>Wildlings, a mostly forgotten John Harper RPG. You assign dice to your stats, from d4 to d12, and you’re trying to roll above a 3, with even higher rolls getting you bonus descriptors as to how you pull off the roll. I think as you gain harm you lose access to those descriptors one-by-one.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Into the Odd</em>, <em>Maze Rats</em> (“rules-lite” OSR)</li>
<li>
<em>Dog Eat Dog</em> (a powerful game about colonialism)</li>
<li>
<em>The Pool</em> (which I wrote about a bit here: <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-pool-powered-by-the-apocalypse/4302" class="inline-onebox">The Pool, Powered by the Apocalypse</a>)</li>

              <p>Ah, I see what you mean. You’re exactly right about what play the mechanics support — there is nothing to support anything social. In fact, the mention in the rules is basically “uhhh roleplay?”, which is a little frustrating since, yes, the characters end up being centered around combat.</p>
<p>They do expand on exploration in books beyond the core rulebook, but that itself is a kind of red flag. The base mechanics, I think, are really wonderful, but they are certainly trapped within an older model.</p>

              <p>I think Symbaroum is a decent system just not for that setting.  Or maybe I’m reading too much into it, I haven’t read all of the setting background.  It seemed like it was about exploration in a dark, foreboding world where there are ancient evils and corruption around every corner.  But the rules are all about making murder machines.  There’s practically nothing about exploration in the rules and just a tiny section on social encounters.  I’ll try it out some more but it feels more like generic fantasy rules when I was hoping for something more.  It’s like trying to run a political intrigue game in D&amp;D, you can do it but the rules don’t do you any favors.</p>

              <p>I’m sort of returning to the hobby after a few years of playing less, so I have little experience with games released over the last few years, but outside of Apocalypse World (which is the only PTbA game I’ve actually played) I remember really liking 3:16 Carnage Among The Stars for it’s simplicity. I believe the author was supposed to use the system for another game “Carnage Among The Tribes”, where you were to play warring barbarian tribes in a dark fantasy type setting. I don’t know if anything ever came of that though.</p>
<p>Cthulhu Dark always worked back when I tried it as well (I’m only familiar with the original 2010 version though).</p>
