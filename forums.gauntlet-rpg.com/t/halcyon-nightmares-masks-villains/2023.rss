    <description>Halcyon Nightmares 

Wednesdays in July at 1 pm CDT/ 1300 GMT – 1 spot reserved for Leandro

Fight the good fight. What a joke. A silly, absurd joke. Fighting for good is a job that is never ending, a project of those who think they can make a utopia. There is no endgame for good: Only waking up another day to keep doing what you&#39;ve been doing all your life. What a waste of powers and potential.

You know better, young and brash as you are you figured this shit out before many of your contemporaries. How many Halcyon citizens run around in colorful garb preaching the trivial jibberish of a hero? How many waste the best years of their lives trying to live up to an ideal that just cannot be made? Idiots, the lot.

Welcome to MASKS, a game normally about teenaged superheroes coming into their own. This will be a switch up, a game of the same parts arranged differently. You all are a lovely team of villains, like the Runaways but flipped, like the Secret Six, like the Fearsome Five or even H.I.V.E. You will be the future of Halcyon, whether they like it or not. If it interests you to be your own Deadpool or Thunderbolts, let&#39;s try this out!
