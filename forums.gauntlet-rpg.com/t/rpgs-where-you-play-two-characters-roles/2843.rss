    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/rpgs-where-you-play-two-characters-roles/2843</link>
    <description>‪Can anyone think of RPGs where you play two characters through various parts of the narrative?‬

Like I suppose in Fall of Magic you do so (your main character and at various times the Magus). What others are there out there?</description>

              <p>It’s not exactly what you’re talking about, but in <em>Wraith: the Oblivion</em> the PCs were ghosts, and each ghost had a dark side (or shadow) that was played by another player. So each player played one ghost and another ghost’s shadow (which had its own goals and tried to interfere or tempt its ghost in various ways).</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, now I see that <a class="mention" href="/u/nickwedig">@Nickwedig</a> already mentioned this. Anyway, it was one of my favorite parts of <em>Wraith</em>.</p>

              <p><em>Final Girl</em> – a GM-less game that emulates slasher films. You take turns playing the Killer or one of the Cast, a common pool of characters that are sowly killed off scene by scene. Sharing a large number of characters works, I think, because the individual characters are not very fleshed out – in my experience, they are usually just based on a common movie tropes or one or two quirks, e.g., the stats-obsessed baseball nerd. That’s fine in FG, because it’s a one-shot and any given character is not expected to last very long, anyway. I suspect this setup would not work as well with more complex characters over multiple play sessions.</p>

<p>If you’re counting playing minor characters as well, I feel like most GMless games fall into this category, like many that have been mentioned. <em>Flotsam</em> is fresh in my mind, just cuz I’m in the middle of reading it. Off the top of my head, <em>Eden</em> is like that, but I’m sure a ton more in that GMless story space where people take on other characters as needed in a scene. Certainly games with larger scope like <em>Microscope</em> and <em>The Quiet Year</em>. Ooh, <em>Legacy</em> is a good one as you play through generations.</p>

              <p>Ars Magica. You’ll play your mage, a companion, and a variety of grogs.</p>
<p>Better Angels. You’ll play a demonically powered supervillain and the demon to another player.</p>
<p>Just started reading Band of Blades. It says it has low character affinity and you might play different characters each time in addition to playing the legion roles.</p>
<p>Good Society. Play your leading character as well as connections and minor characters for other players.</p>

              <p>‪Can anyone think of RPGs where you play two characters through various parts of the narrative?‬</p>
<p>Like I suppose in Fall of Magic you do so (your main character and at various times the Magus). What others are there out there?</p>
