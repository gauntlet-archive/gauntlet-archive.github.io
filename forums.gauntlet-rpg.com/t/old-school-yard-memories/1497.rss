    <title>Old School Yard - Memories</title>

    <description>inspired somewhat by Black Gate move in dungeon world

what if you have a School Memory move when you go Unconscious in Dungeon World, Urban Shadows etc where its been awhile since you were at school.

Roll +Wisdom/Spirit
10+ = You have a fond memory from your school days that resurfaces. This makes you feel good and reminds you of a lesson learned that helps you now - describe it.

7-9 = A turbulent memory bubbles up from your school days. Either 
- You feel rested, but realise an old enemy / problem has resurfaced.
- or You will receive Magic/Supernatural aid in the future, which is tied to your family or school.

6- = Your nightmares have become reality. They are coming back, just like they came when you were younger... who are they and what do they want?</description>

              <p>Cool idea! Though I would probably not tie it to a school yard, especially not for Dungeon World (not every character grew up in a strictly regulated school environment,  I’d think).</p>
<p>Maybe call it Blast from the Past - that could still be school, but also could mean other things.</p>
