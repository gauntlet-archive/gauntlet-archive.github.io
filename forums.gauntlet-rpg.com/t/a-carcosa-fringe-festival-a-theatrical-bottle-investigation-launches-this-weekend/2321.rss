    <description>&gt; I hope this letter finds you healthy and that you have been living well since we last saw each other. I&#39;m putting on a play this weekend and I would be most pleased if you would come to see it — I&#39;ll have some comp tickets put aside for you. The show really is something special and I&#39;m especially keen to introduce you to its key player.

My latest Mythos investigation *A Carcosa Fringe Festival* launches this weekend. It&#39;s a short bottle episode of an investigation where the players visit a theatre above a Soho pub to watch a fringe theatre production of *A King in Yellow*. Suffice to say, it&#39;s not the most comfortable of productions.

It&#39;s been written for **The Cthulhu Hack**, but I&#39;ll be running it with **Cthulhu Dark** on Free RPG Day itself (if you&#39;re in London, come up to Leisure Games if you want to sit in!). I imagine most keepers are adept at tweaking things for their favourite system regardless. 

**I&#39;m also touting for pull quotes for the pitch page when it goes on sale, so if you&#39;d be happy to share your thoughts on the module then I&#39;ll happily share a preview copy with you this week!**</description>
