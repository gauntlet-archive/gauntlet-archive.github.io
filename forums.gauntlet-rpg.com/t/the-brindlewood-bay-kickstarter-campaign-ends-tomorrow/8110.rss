    <description>Hello! The Kickstarter campaign for my game Brindlewood Bay is ending tomorrow night! We have had a very successful campaign so far—over 4000% funded, 20 stretch goals unlocked, and a brand new Roll20 Companion reward added. It would help us out a lot if you would take a look at the campaign and consider pledging!
