    <description>First post!

I’m dabbling with a simple system which requires very little math. You roll xd6 and keep the highest single result. Similar in respect to Silhouette/Silcore and Hero Kids. I’m not sure if any board games use this dice mechanic (let me know if you’ve heard of any).

Here is what I’ve got so far:

To succeed you need to roll higher than the nominal difficulty (from 1 easy to 5 extreme) set by the GM. If rolling against an opponent compare the highest single die roll. If tied, discard and compare the next highest die roll. Repeat until one player succeeds or runs out of dice. If it&#39;s still tied, default to the player. Sometimes circumstances may make a task easier or more difficult than usual. If advantageous, roll an extra die (to a maximum of 6d6) keeping the highest result. With any disadvantages, roll an extra die and keep the lowest result (to a maximum of 6d6).

When making an action, roll a number of six-sided dice (d6) equal to your attribute. The highest die is your result. If the character has a score of 0 in an attribute they roll 2d6 and keep the lowest result. The maximum number of dice a player can roll is 6d6 (the rule of six).

Dice rolls are only made when attempting actions where there is a chance of failure. You wouldn&#39;t need make a roll to open an unlocked door, climb over a low wall or run across flat ground. On the other hand, you would make a roll if you were trying to kick down a locked door, shoot someone, or run across broken or treacherous ground without losing your footing.

Thoughts so far?</description>

              <p>I want this to be a fairly difficult game for characters to succeed. Let’s assume the average NPC has a 0 for each attribute. If you’ve got a 1 in any attribute that is significant. 2 is rare. 3 almost unheard of.</p>
<p>Now another thought is what if the difficulty scale of 1-5 isn’t a number, it’s the dice you’ve got to beat. You could have the GM roll the dice (or player’s if you wanted). For example: You are a thief trying to pick a lock and there is a chance of failure. It’s a routine lock, so the difficulty is 1. The GM rolls 1d6 and gets a 3. Your thief has a 1 in the relevant attribute and a set of tools that gives them another d6. So you roll, 2d6 and try to beat 3. Perhaps you could also waste a d6 to make the GM re-roll the difficulty.</p>

              <p>Space Hulk worked similar to this back in the day. It always been one of my reference points for excellent dice mechanics.</p>
<p>Storm Bolter: Hits if you roll at least one 6 with 2d6<br>
Assault Cannon: Hits if you roll at least on 5 on 3d6<br>
Close Combat: Genestealers roll 3d6, Marines roll 1d6. Highest roll wins, loser dies.</p>
<p>Also Far Away Land is a cartoony fantasy RPG which uses a very similar system. There is probably still a free quickstart available.</p>
