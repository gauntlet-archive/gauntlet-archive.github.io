<p>You’ll find the new game <b>Never Knows Best</b> created by Fraser Simons offers a quite unique setting as you play teens who can transform into robots to deal with their problems and growing up. Taking cues from FLCL – or „FuriKuri“ as I remember the series – the setting promises to be a tad bit wild. The system is a mix of Powered by the Apocalypse and Blades in the Dark. I am intruiged and starred the project. The only other fully fledged game in the list is <b>The Quantum Drift</b>. From what I understood it takes the tradition of „forum fiction rpgs“, where one continues a story from the perspective of their character in essentially a writers circle, and takes it to Facebook. I think it sounds interesting, yet am a bit confused about the need to crowdfund it.<br>
Next to the games there are two Patreons. On the one hand you can support <b>Tracy Barnett</b> as they are creating tabletop rpgs (I guess story games style), podcasts, offer streaming and more. On the other hand you might look at the Patreon of <b>Anna Kreider</b> and help her writing about feminism in game and helping marginalizted groups. I think both patreons are pretty cool.<br>
Among the sourcebooks I am most tempted by <b>On Downtimes and Demesense</b>. The topics are quite interesting and I am having an eye on it. If you’d like to check it out, it has already less than a week to go. For fans of richly illustrated fantasy rpgs <b>Trudvang Chronicles: Mupselheim</b> is a must see. Well, and if you like to have another combat system for a popular fantasy setting, check out the <b>Percentile dice combat module</b>. You might as well marvel at dice like <b>The Path of Chaos Metal RPG Dice Set</b> or the <b>Solid Brass Raised Pip Dice</b>.<br>
Next to quite some more projects worth having a look at:<br>
<b><br>
English Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>2 Role-Playing Games<br>
2 Patreons<br>
5 Sourcebooks<br>
2 Adventures<br>
4 Dice Projects<br>
3 Accessoires<br>
1 Card Deck<br>
1 Notebooks<br>
3 Enamel Pins<br>
4 Various RPG Projects</p>
<p><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b></p>
<p>1 Role-Playing Game</p>
