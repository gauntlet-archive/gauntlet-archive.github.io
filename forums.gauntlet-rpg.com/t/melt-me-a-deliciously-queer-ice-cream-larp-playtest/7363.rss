***You need a cup of icecream to play***

**Melt Me** is a intimate larp about self discovery through pleasure, specifically the pleasure of eating ice cream.

My boyfriend and I are working on this larp as an entry to this year&#39;s Golden Cobra Larp contest.

**Concept:**
The catch-phrase of the game is &quot;A Deliciously Queer Gayme About Identity, Icecream, and Cumming Together&quot;

The subject matter of this game is 18+. We are men playing together in a gay bath&#39;s darkroom in Nakazakicho, Osaka.

During play, we get &quot;intimate&quot; with each other through eating ice cream!

By the climax of the game we decide as a group how we should finish together: Do we lick our cups clean? Will we smother the creamy sweetness all over our faces or bodies? Or, will we save some for later?

**Aim:**
We discover who our characters during the game, asking each other probing questions only when we taste icecream.

**Tone:**
The tone of the game is queer, sensual, and playful. We may potentially play with themes of loss.

**Safety:**
Importantly no sex acts are committed during play, but ice-cream (or an alternative creamy delight) is indeed ingested.

We will be using an open door policy and a version of of script change involving choreographed moans and groans.

At the end we will engage in a brief decompression.

**Feedback**:
Finally, we will take feedback from players, to help improve play and deepen the themes. We highly value your insights.
Here is the play document if you would like a look:

**Note:** An extra spot is being reserved for Gerrit Reininghaus, who suggested I offer this on the Gauntlet Calendar.
