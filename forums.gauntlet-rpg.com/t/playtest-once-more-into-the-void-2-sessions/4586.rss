**Please only sign up if you&#39;re interested in playtesting!**

I would prefer if participants could attend both sessions, if that&#39;s possible. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. **Please note that this game is still in playtest. It&#39;s a hack of Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands but I took some liberties with the mini-games. No knowledge of the system is required!**

This session is scheduled for 3 hours. I will email everyone a week ahead. Sessions will be recorded through Streamyard for reference, but only released for public consumption if all players consent.

***You’ve tried leaving the stars behind, the void, all of it. After the dangers you’ve faced and the sacrifices you’ve made - your adventures left you with a broken heart. Betrayed by your beliefs, you spent years nursing your regret.***

***But the void calls you again, and all the worlds need saving. If you don’t act now we could lose it all. You can’t do it alone. You need to convince a crew to come together, one last time. They have every right to hate you, and no reason to trust you. You weren’t there for them when they needed you most. But they can’t help but believe in you, even after all that you did.***

***Will you prove they were right to trust you again, or will they die cursing your name?***

**Touchstones:** Mass Effect 2, Star Trek: Picard.

**Content Warning** : There are numerous game choices that lead towards romance and sexual tension (though we will have a PG-13 rating). I tend to design emotional games and this is definitely one of them! Death, violence, and other similar things will come up. There is also a strong possibility your characters may die or betray the group, but we&#39;ll always check in with each other.

**Safety tools** : We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

**Session 1:** [date=2020-03-03 time=09:00:00 timezone=&quot;Asia/Singapore&quot;] https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M065HQiOhn9Ck8U50gs 
**Session 2:** [date=2020-03-10 time=09:00:00 timezone=&quot;Asia/Singapore&quot;] https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M065UQHuPMvGXSyDgMZ</description>
