    <description>Hi!

Soundtracks, ambiences etc. are getting more and more popular, and that&#39;s cool! But I&#39;m looking for instances when someone actually makes music in AP. Do you know examples you could hint at?

I&#39;m generally interested in this music/game intersection (and can talk lots about that), with info gathered here I&#39;m also planning to fill the longer list in the wiki article at: http://musicgames.wikidot.com/glossary:rpg#examples

Already there are two examples:
* BomBARDed (that&#39;s mostly edited in); and 
* Adventurers&amp;Artists, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyXV7biU54k (here there&#39;s a separate &quot;musical personnel&quot; that improvises in parallel with role-players). 

I know of one more instance of rapping/recitative in &quot;Tomes of the Chaos Bard&quot;, which is diegetic, but quite short (would link that too, but I still have a limit in posts  ;)  ). 

Will be very grateful for hints, links, etc. and also opinions from those who enjoy/disdain such elements, or creative details on using it in your actual plays, if you tried or thought about it.

So can you say, maybe you know, what was the nature of this second vid with a keyboardist and the party on a six-fold splitscreen? Was that a completely separate part of the show or was there some connection to the game played?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for the material!</p>

Darn, it’s a quizz, not the enigma I was looking for. Still, I leave the trail at that.

              <p>I’m sure Donjon de Nahelbeuk does more than just a few seconds: they’re an actual play troupe and a medfan rock band.<br>
Also, a song by Kat in 2D6+Cool’s Quest campaign. And a Sentaï opening song in 2D6+Cool’s Sentaï episode. Either there’s a lot of spontaneous AP performances you missed, or indeed it’s a french thing to play music or sing  while you play.</p>

<p>Quite intriguing. Didn’t expect for this “Crystal” one to be in French too. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> But maybe that’s some sort of a niche cultural connection to explore. ( statistics! ;p ) (+ Selina Transforms is most often a great choice).</p>
<p>As for live musical performing in Actual Plays, so far the types most frequent are “beatbox / onomatopoeia” mimicking of some music performed by the in-game character. Have seen some new examples in my recent searches but none longer than a few seconds. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
