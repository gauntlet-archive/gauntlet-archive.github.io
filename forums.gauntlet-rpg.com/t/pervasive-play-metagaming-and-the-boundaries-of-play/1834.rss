    <description>I&#39;m interested in your experiences of and thoughts on playing/running/designing games that expand the boundaries of play.

In tabletop RPGs we can see the appeal of playing different games within a shared narrative world (as discussed by @jasoncordova in [this thread](https://discourse.funtimers.club/t/the-golden-shroud-campaign/1378). There have been other discussions about carrying over characters between different games, [secrecy in games](https://discourse.funtimers.club/t/secrecy-pros-and-cons/1810), collaborative worldbuilding etc.

In LARPs, I guess that there is a lot of discussion about pervasive play through use of technology/augmented reality or by playing characters in a &#39;city larp&#39; for example.

I&#39;m at my parents house in the countryside at the moment and I&#39;m looking through old drawings, stories I wrote, toys and books. And then when I walk around the fields and hills and woods I recognise places in the landscape that were central to the games my friends and I played. All of these elements seemed to feed back into each other into a continuous feedback loop of play (during Summer holidays at least!)

The [Masquerade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masquerade_(book)) book was a big deal when I was very young and I&#39;m still pretty fascinated by the story surrounding it.

I read The Dungeon Master book about [James Dallas Egbert III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dallas_Egbert_III) (it was lurid and trashy) and saw Mazes and Monsters (terrible) but I was pretty gripped when they teased some of those themes in True Detective (season 3)
![Leng|690x297](upload://katTXIVJMixk4RgiSU08zn8y719.jpeg) 

Last year I listened eagerly to the [podcast](https://www.radiotopia.fm/showcase/the-polybius-conspiracy/) about [Polybius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(urban_legend)).

These are all pretty extreme examples of the boundaries of play being expanded but they highlight the thrilling temptation of finding real buried treasure or, uh, exploring steam tunnels as well as the real possibilities of manipulation, abuse and lack of safety/consent in play.

Sorry if this is a bit rambling and incoherent but yeah, I&#39;m curious about your thoughts and experiences of play beyond the tabletop!</description>

<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>I think that, as much as I enjoy playing tabletop RPGs, I have never felt the level of engagement/embodiment/immersion that I have in LARP and I guess that the majority of ttrpgs are not designed for that experience. I think that it’s fair to say that some of your own designs have been instrumental in bridging that gap and introducing elements of LARP to a broader roleplaying community.</p>
<p>I am very interested in that intersection between play and non-play and I suppose that this leads back to some of the stuff discussed in the <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/everything-is-a-designable-surface/840">everything is a designable surface</a> thread.</p>
<p>I think that I often forget how powerful utilising the spaces we inhabit (geographical/physical/digital/cultural) can be in play.</p>

<p>Last year I listened eagerly to the <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/showcase/the-polybius-conspiracy/">podcast</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_(urban_legend)">Polybius</a>.</p>
<p>These are all pretty extreme examples of the boundaries of play being expanded but they highlight the thrilling temptation of finding real buried treasure or, uh, exploring steam tunnels as well as the real possibilities of manipulation, abuse and lack of safety/consent in play.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is a bit rambling and incoherent but yeah, I’m curious about your thoughts and experiences of play beyond the tabletop!</p>
