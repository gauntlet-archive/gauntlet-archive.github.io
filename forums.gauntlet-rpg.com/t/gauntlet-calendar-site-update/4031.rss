    <title>Gauntlet Calendar Site Update</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-calendar-site-update/4031</link>
    <description>On Sunday 11/24 from 2AM to 4AM Eastern, the Gauntlet Calendar site will be down. This is to put in some minor fixes and close off a security vulnerability. After the fix, GMs will not receive emails when someone signs up for their game. We hope this will be temporary feature loss and we&#39;ll get that restored soon. We&#39;ll be looking at and testing the functionality of the calendar for the couple of days after that. If you notice any odd behavior or errors, please send me a heads up.</description>
