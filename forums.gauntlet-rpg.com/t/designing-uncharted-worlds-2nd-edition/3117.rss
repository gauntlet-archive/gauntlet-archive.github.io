    <description>Back when I was designing Uncharted Worlds, writing about my thoughts and design process on G+ provided me with a measure of stability and motivation. It was a very positive experience to get feedback, impressions, and ideas from the community. And even if no one responded, the act of organizing my thoughts and writing them out still had a “[rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)” effect.

Assuming this kind of thing is kosher, I’ll be using this thread as a general design-blog-journal-thingy, and being able to poll the community, get feedback, etc. I’m hoping to find that same place of safety and energy here in trying to design Uncharted Worlds 2nd Edition (UW2). 

First up, though, a bit of a postmortem of Uncharted Worlds. What worked, and what fell flat...</description>

              <p>Hi all. I know it’s been forever. I’m sorry. Too many issues to go into, some entirely inside my head. It’s been… four months? God.</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you ALL for your continued support of Uncharted Worlds and my efforts in creating UW2. I’m consistently floored by the outpouring of kind words for my humble little offering to the roleplaying scene. Creating a source of fun, of joy, of enjoyment with friends… it means more to me than I can express. I strive to be worthy of that praise.</p>
<p>On to UW2 news. I have an Alpha document ready to go. However, this current thread is rather long in the tooth.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the one hand, a bunch of people are following it, so it makes it easy to get in touch with all of them. Plus there’s a lot of history/development that might be interesting to come folks.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a thread this size is daunting, and could put off a lot of folks. Plus a lot of the info is out of date or not relevant anymore, and important stuff could get lost.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So I have a question for you folks: Should I start a fresh, new “Uncharted Worlds 2 Alpha” thread, or should I keep going here (and maybe update the first post)?</strong></p>
<p>Again, sorry for dropping off the face of the earth. I really should have been more communicative, even just to say “nothing to report, having trouble getting out of bed”.</p>

<p>I’m excited for the potential improvements in a second edition, but it’s worth mentioning that the first edition has been/still is a joy to GM. I’m home-brewing some economy changes that I’ll implement in my game, but I’d be very interested to hear about your plans for the acquisition and favor/debt system in the new edition.</p>
<p>Hope 2021 is going okay so far! Thanks!</p>

I love the direction everything has been going in and I was just wandering if there is any word on the Alpha Document (and if you’d like play testers) or at least a revised version of the Careers document / XP bits</p>

              <p>Yo, just found this thread - I only found the first version of the game three days ago, and promptly fell in love with it. I was planning to run a first session after the current arc of my D&amp;D campaign wraps up in a month or so, but now I can’t wait to see how this goes!</p>
<p>As for acronym, maybe UnWorlds works? I know a lot of people go with the shortened versions devs use - most people call it Skyrim instead of TES5, after all</p>

<p>No lie, I was <em>strongly</em> considering naming it Uncharted Worlds: Unlimited or something, just for the UwU acronym, but I talked myself out of it. It doesn’t fit the theme or tone, sadly, no matter how good a marketing coup it would be.</p>
<p>Seriously, Having an easily recognizable acronym is <em>gold</em> for sales. “UW” doesn’t really cut it. “Uh-wh”? “You-Double-You”? Bah.</p>

<p>Congrats on your progress with the game though! Always excited to hear how it’s coming along. My guess is you’ll have lots of people eager to test your game. I’ve started posting in a few discords, like the one for Stop, Hack and Roll, which seems to be a platfrom where a lot of RPG enthusiasts hang out these days.</p>

<p>Hi folks. Sorry about the long periods of silence. It’s been a hell of a month, lots of personal stuff (mostly bad, a few bright moments).</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that UW2 is now at a mostly playable stage, enough so that I can <em>feel</em> what it wants to be when playtesting. That’s always a huge boon to a designer, when a system or component  makes itself known.<br>
Several systems have gone through multiple iterations because of this, including core Moves, career Moves, and the Downtime system. I’ve also closed in on the shape of advancement/XP, and on how I’ll be handing gear. It’s all coming together quite nicely, at a slow but steady pace.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to have new, updated Alpha documents soon, so I can share all this stuff with you. For the moment it’s kinda the digital equivalent of notes scribbled on cocktail napkins. But it works! And it’s fun! And I’m looking forward to writing the meat of the system.</p>
<p>At some point in the not-too-distant future I’m going to have to run playtests with folks who aren’t part of my weekly gaming group, to get a set of fresh eyes on the system. And I’d love to. Sadly, these days, I have no idea <em>how</em> to organize a Random-Person-On-The-Internet rp session. Or where to look. Also possibly running a play-by-post? Problems for Future Sean.</p>
<p>Anywho, just dropping in with a project update, and hoping you’re all doing well.</p>
<p>Also: Good to see you <a class="mention" href="/u/andante">@andante</a>! Glad you joined, sorry I didn’t reply right away. Always good to see folks from The G+ That Was, reminder of The Before Times.</p>

I had no idea UW2 is under development after we were scattered to the four winds.  Glad to see that you’ve picked up the pen again and will be following its development closely!  Hopefully I’ll get around to running games again so I can playtest this!</p>
