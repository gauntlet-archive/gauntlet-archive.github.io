    <title>CARTEL: Once Upon a Time in Durango</title>

    <description>The all access time for this game is September 2nd, 2021 at 3 pm EST.

Here are five October sessions of CARTEL by Magpie Games.

Cartel is a PBTA game in which you play ordinary people mired in the drugs, money, and violence of the Mexican drug war. The players tell a story of bloody drama and tragic violence set against the tense backdrop of the broader Mexican experience in Durango, Mexico in 2007.

Genre touchstones are Breaking Bad, The Wire, Jackie Brown, Sicario, and Robert Rodriguez’s Mexico Trilogy.

Cartel is designed to be a gritty, violent, and morally murky experience. Before play we will have a discussion aimed at;

1. Allowing us to depict the setting in a respectful way.
2. Setting some boundaries so that we all can feel safe while we play. We’ll use lines and veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door to help us have a safe fun time.

This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. We will use Streamyard and a character keeper to play. I will record and post the session to Youtube if all players consent.
