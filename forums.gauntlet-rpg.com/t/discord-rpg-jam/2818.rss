    <description>We’re already playing RPGs &amp; chatting with our game friends online, why not make some RPGs specifically designed to play on Discord? This could be a really fun way of using the Gauntlet&#39;s Discord server!

DiscordRPGJam will run from tomorrow through the end of August. Join here: https://itch.io/jam/discord-rpg-jam

The rules are simple:

1. Make a roleplaying game that is best played on Discord. Feel free to make use of any of Discord’s features, such as text chatrooms, voice chatrooms, direct messages, pinned posts, file uploads, etc.

2. Don’t be a bigot.

Have fun!</description>
