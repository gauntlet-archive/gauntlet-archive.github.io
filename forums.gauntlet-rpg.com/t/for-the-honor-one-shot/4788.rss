***For the first 24 hours of the posting of this game, please sign up if you have been directly affected by current events and are unable to go to work, school, etc and have to stay home.***

This session is scheduled for 4 hours (with 3-4 breaks). We will learn the game as we play, it&#39;s a very simple one!

The session will be recorded if everyone is cool with it! If not, no worries. We will be using Zoom. I will email everyone a few days ahead of the game to confirm attendance.

***Athera is a land full of magical people, fantastical creatures, and mystical kingdoms. It is studded with ancient ruins left behind by a long lost civilization. It had always been a peaceful realm.***

***That was until about twelve years ago when the Legion came down from the stars and began to colonize the planet. Their expansion was swift and brutal. Caught on the back foot, the kingdoms of Athera gathered all of their most powerful magic users—called Princesses—and forged the first Princess Accord. Unified, they were successful in beating the Legion back to their stronghold. Sadly, their final assault ended in tragedy. The Princess Accord shattered and the Kingdoms turned to isolation.***

***It has been twelve years, and a new generation of princesses is beginning to see the need for another Accord. The Legion has been attacking towns again. The Kingdoms are sending out dance invitations. And the Tangled Woods have been getting stranger and stranger.***

***You, the princesses and warriors of factions at odds, will fight, quarrel, and flirt in your efforts to sway Athera in your favor.***
