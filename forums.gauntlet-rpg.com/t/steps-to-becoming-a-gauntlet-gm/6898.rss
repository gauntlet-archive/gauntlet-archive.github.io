    <description>Hi everyone!

I was fortunate enough to be able to play in 3 sessions of games in April as a newly active member.

* [Murderous Ghosts](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MVmV8V-Z2s9bRQ_qbrM) (a PtbA game)
* [Playdate: Let&#39;s Play](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MXdG09c-qvxXYMbtFnq) (a GxB hack)
* [Season of Dreams](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MSYrGkm1lATXXnAFnuE) (a PtbA game)

I was quite tight-lipped in the beginning as a non-native speaker, but gradually opened up. My last game, Season of Dreams 3. was one of my best English roleplaying experience (I play online since 2010 if I remember correctly) 

I guess this three occasion were not enough to really know me and vouch for me, but I hope that my GMs (@SinisterBeard @EpistolaryRichard @BlakeRyan ) and other fellow players can confirm that I am an okay person :)

What are the next steps to become a Gauntlet GM and run one shots?</description>
