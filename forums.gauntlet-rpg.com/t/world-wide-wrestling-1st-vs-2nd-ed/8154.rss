    <description>I&#39;ve heard different opinions on advantages and disadvantages of 1st and 2nd edition WWW, but I haven&#39;t played enough myself to be able to meaningfully gain anything from reading the text. What&#39;s your take on this? Is it possible to move some of the things you prefer in one edition over to the other?</description>
