    <description>What&#39;s the campaign you REALLY want to run to conclusion but haven&#39;t yet been able to do?

I want to run a full Wield game that uses Microscope to build the Age of the World and then the players get to wreck it.  The game we played of this ended a bit prematurely but was amazing.

I want to do another Ars Magica game and a Deadwood inspired Western.</description>

              <p>Any sort of long-form (as in multiple years) campaign that builds its own complex continuity through emergent play, though I’d especially enjoy a superhero game that does that.</p>
<p>I want to be able to pull in NPCs that the players had last interacted with months before in new and interesting roles, where we could see how their lives have developed since they were last seen in-game.</p>

Anyone remember Wilderness of Mirrors? Always wanted to do one of those. Of course, I always like Supers stuff, so I would probably make it be some kind of superspy flavor to it.</p>

(I’m about as far as possible from a Cthulhu Purist; see <em>Kingsport</em>, passim.) I tried to get it to work with Cortex Plus Drama but that system just…doesn’t quite get there.

          <blockquote>
              <p>I have two dream campaigns. One based on nostalgia and one on my contemporary gaming preferences.</p>
<p>The nostalgia campaign would be a lightly re-skined version of <em>Pendragon</em> for running a campaign in the First Age of Middle-Earth, à la <em>The Silmarilion</em>. I feel <em>Pendragon</em> would be the perfect chassis for conveying the spirit of the narrative and the writing style of that book. Despite being completely off Tolkien, it’s the book of his that I have the most attachment to. And <em>Pendragon</em> is part of my role-playing history. After a long-running <em>Pendragon</em> campaign in my youth, it holds a special place in my heart (RIP Greg Stafford).</p>
<p>The contemporary-preferences campaign would be an <em>Archipelago III</em> campaign with a lot of smaller games feeding into the story. Session -1 would be an <em>A thousand years under the sun</em> game. Session zero would be a game of <em>House of Reeds</em>. Those two would be the background for the beginning of the <em>Archipelago</em> campaign, the setting and relationships. As we played through the <em>Archipelago</em> campaign, we would take one-session breaks to play smaller games that would feed setting and backstory details into the main story.</p>
<p>If we needed the backstory for an artifact maybe we would play a session of <em>Cursed Chronicle</em>, a 200 word RPG. If we need a cosmogony maybe we would play a session of <em>This Rare Fabric</em>, another 200 word RPG. If we needed a site, maybe a session of <em>How to Host a Dungeon</em> or something similar. If we needed fronts or need to advance fronts then maybe we would play <em>The Queen’s Word</em>, yet another 200 word, chess-roleplaying game. There are many, many smaller single session games that could be used this way.</p>
<p>Why would I do it this way? Well, you may or may not have figured it out already, but this post is long enough, so I’ll save that for another thread</p>

<p>I think Blades in the Dark works well for urban industrial fantasy, or a hacked/reskinned version of Urban Shadows.</p>

</aside>
<p>Settingwise, definitely, but gameplaywise I want something more character focused than Blades (and also less action/heisty), and less laser focused on faction politics than Urban Shadows.  (That said, you’ve listed two of my favorite games, so you’ve hit on my taste pretty well.)  Part of me thinks that Burning Wheel could be reworked for it with new lifepaths, traits, etc., but I’m not sure.  Still, may give you a sense of the kind of play I’m looking for.</p>

              <p>hmm crazy idea… three games, one setting.</p>
<p>So like decent sized city, monsterhearts, monster of the week and urban shadows all in the same city</p>
<p>Does not have to be same MC, but they’d have to meet often to update public or supernatural events - eg  X happened to the bookstore on 5th avenue and it was in the news etc</p>
<p>Would need to be a reasonably large city to allow enough  events without the national guard being sent in (though that would be the end of season 1 climax)</p>
<p>The MC(s) would  discuss major plot events - eg astral wasps in ep 3, predator style aliens in ep 7, other events are just for individual games only.</p>
