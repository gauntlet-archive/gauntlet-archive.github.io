              <p>Hello!</p>
<p>Gamicon 2020 will run from Friday (Feb. 28) through Sunday (March 1) in Cedar Rapids, IA, at the Marriott (address below). Gamicon</p>
<p>The convention itself is a typical small to medium-sized Midwest gaming convention (400-500 attendees) with a fair amount of board and card games. D&amp;D and Pathfinder are really big as well. Gamicon has been around for over 25 years.</p>
<p>The group that I’m part of, Corridor Games on Demand works to share indie and small press RPGs at local conventions and the downtown Cedar Rapids Public Library. We’ve been doing this since 2012 in the area.</p>
