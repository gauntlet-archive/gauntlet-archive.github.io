    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-3-of-3-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 3 of 3 – Zine Quest, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/09 and 02/19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Following my operation this collection is a bit delayed, and thanks to the zine quest it totals more than 150 projects of whom more than 70 are actual games. Thus I decided to split the collection in three parts, the other two being:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-1-of-3/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 1 of 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-2-of-3-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 2 of 3 – Zine Quest&lt;/a&gt;

The Zine Quest brought up an astounding amount of new, whole tabletop rpg games, thus lets get to them. &lt;b&gt;The Deep Nightly Fathoms&lt;/b&gt; is a PbtA-like game in which you explore dream worlds inspired by the artworks of Gustave Doré. The zine looks absolutely stunning and the topic well done, which is why I am tempted. &lt;b&gt;HOME: SURVIVAL&lt;/b&gt; is way less dreamy, as you got your home and the world if coming to an end. The game has a rotating gamemaster and explores how your characters handle the bleak situation. If you don’t like it that depressing, you might &lt;b&gt;DELVE&lt;/b&gt; into the depths of a fantasy dungeon, drawing it along the way. Thus, you might use the result of the solo game for your next campaign, cool.
If you are more up for drama, &lt;b&gt;The Last Place on Earth&lt;/b&gt; has you explore the hubris and adventures spirit of Robert F. Scott’s doomed race to explore Antarctica. A game for which you need no GM. If you like your drama lighter and more fun, check out &lt;b&gt;The Poodle Fanciers Club&lt;/b&gt;. Your playing nasty, or maybe devious, maybe desperate, housewives vying to climb to the top of their poodle club. A game I would have backed, would the zine deliver outside the US. Then there’s the light-drama game &lt;b&gt;Operation: Playground&lt;/b&gt;. You’ll play kids with a creative kids view upon the world, which – at least for the kids – might as well be dramatically exciting.
If you want your drama to be all about feudalism, try vying for the &lt;b&gt;Rebel Crown&lt;/b&gt;. A Forged in the Dark Spiel about a claiment for the throne and their entcourage who have to brave feudal fights and intruige. Which I support, well pledged to. If you want your characters pledges to revenge a dead Queen, checkout the PbtA-inspired game &lt;b&gt;Our Queen Crumbles&lt;/b&gt;. Like the magic aspects and the topic and thus recommend it.
Changeling or fae courts are as well somewhat feudal, though I would describe them as rather fairy tale like. &lt;b&gt;Cold Iron&lt;/b&gt; explores old folktales and stories for fantasy off the throtten paths of Tolkien and forms a really cool setting of it’s own. Check it out. Maybe you grew up on the Tales of Oz and are new in for &lt;b&gt;The New Tales of Oz&lt;/b&gt;. I’ve only watched the Wizard of Oz movie, yet that zine looks really fascinating and as it has more to offer. I am keeping an eye on it. &lt;b&gt;Under The Floorboards&lt;/b&gt; does cite „The Borrowers“ as its inspiration. Yet I personally do think it looks more along fairy tales like „Thumbelina“ or „The Steadfast Tin Soldier“ from my childhood. Anyway, I highly recommend it. I actually backed &lt;b&gt;Thistle and Hearth&lt;/b&gt;, a game about belonging among outsiders with an intruiging take on Changelings. The PbtA playbooks spoke strongly to me.
Maybe you feel your inner punk stirring up after so much fairytale stuff. &lt;b&gt;Punktopia&lt;/b&gt; has you covered with punkrock adventures where you stick it to the man. YEAH! My Brujah heart wants to backe it, while my Ventrue brain points to my account. I might keep my inner punk to mixtapes and you you like those you should check out the &lt;b&gt;Monster Mix&lt;/b&gt; RPG. Maybe you ain’t sure what to put on it and do a roadtrip with some soul searching first, which is covered in &lt;b&gt;i’m gonna be&lt;/b&gt;. Well, and if you wanna gonna be on a concert and have some love drama check out &lt;b&gt;Oh No I’m Late to the MCR Concert &amp; I Have an Extra Ticket&lt;/b&gt;.
Maybe you are looking for a nice Space game for your kids. The &lt;b&gt;SPACE KIDS RPG&lt;/b&gt; has you covered with some educational content and the &lt;b&gt;Space Goblins!&lt;/b&gt; appear to be more focused on the fun side of things.
Space Pulp, at least how I defined it, with Cronenberg-looking entries like &lt;b&gt;The Bone Age&lt;/b&gt; are not that kids friendly, I guess. Neither is &lt;b&gt;Treasures of T’urokk&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;UNCONQUERED&lt;/b&gt; – with the latter one pointing to being bronze-age sword &amp; sorcery &amp; sandales &amp; Sci-Fi mix.
The currently funding Trophy game got a lot of spinoff games in this round of zines. With &lt;b&gt;Oligarchy&lt;/b&gt; being my favorite. Kind of House of Cards as a ttrpg and presenting so convincingly that I not only went for a PDF option (as they don’t do international shipping) but got the main rpg. I didn’t manage to resist &lt;b&gt;Night Reign&lt;/b&gt; – which focus on stealthy misdeeds – either and barely could say no to the nautical horrors of &lt;b&gt;Sunken&lt;/b&gt;.
The Urban Fantasy corner uses &lt;b&gt;SMALL TOWN: SKELETONS&lt;/b&gt; to address the boring to the bone challenges of little towns. While the gm-less and one-shot based &lt;b&gt;Web-Slingers: Into the Worlds-Wide Web&lt;/b&gt; essentially delivers a setting along Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse as Powered by the Apocalypse. The only thing I got about &lt;b&gt;THE VIOLET SANCTION&lt;/b&gt; is that it’s Urban Fantasy and queerpunk. Other than that I literally can’t understand the project with its arbitary boldness and capitalization of letters. It gives me an headache. Well, and &lt;b&gt;Fruitless Existence&lt;/b&gt; just managed to get me to my breaking point of „too much kickstarters“. Maybe people like to play horny, murderous fruits with a deathwish. It only gets a blank and disappointed stare from me.
Then again, I do actually like and backed the Larp &lt;b&gt;#Flirtsquad&lt;/b&gt;. Basically being about respectful (and successful? eh, nevermind, respectful!) flirting. Very good!
There are many, many more cool projects. Like &lt;b&gt;The Watching Book&lt;/b&gt;, which may serve as an Accessoire and ingame artefact or &lt;b&gt;Ancestry and Cultur&lt;/b&gt;e, which offers interesting alternatives to the concept of „race“ in D&amp;D 5E. &lt;b&gt;The Accessible Gaming Quarterly&lt;/b&gt; aims t make the hobby more inclusive, yet sadly is way out of my budget. I still recommend having a look. There’s supplements like &lt;b&gt;CRUACH&lt;/b&gt; for adding swamps to Casket Lands um and &lt;b&gt;Inside Out&lt;/b&gt; to add viscieral horror to games.
You’ll find fhose and many more project here:
