<p>Following my operation this collection is a bit delayed, and thanks to the zine quest it totals more than 150 projects of whom more than 70 are actual games. Thus I decided to split the collection in three parts, the other two being:<br>
<a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-1-of-3/" rel="nofollow noopener">Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 1 of 3</a><br>

<p>The Zine Quest brought up an astounding amount of new, whole tabletop rpg games, thus lets get to them. <b>The Deep Nightly Fathoms</b> is a PbtA-like game in which you explore dream worlds inspired by the artworks of Gustave Doré. The zine looks absolutely stunning and the topic well done, which is why I am tempted. <b>HOME: SURVIVAL</b> is way less dreamy, as you got your home and the world if coming to an end. The game has a rotating gamemaster and explores how your characters handle the bleak situation. If you don’t like it that depressing, you might <b>DELVE</b> into the depths of a fantasy dungeon, drawing it along the way. Thus, you might use the result of the solo game for your next campaign, cool.<br>
If you are more up for drama, <b>The Last Place on Earth</b> has you explore the hubris and adventures spirit of Robert F. Scott’s doomed race to explore Antarctica. A game for which you need no GM. If you like your drama lighter and more fun, check out <b>The Poodle Fanciers Club</b>. Your playing nasty, or maybe devious, maybe desperate, housewives vying to climb to the top of their poodle club. A game I would have backed, would the zine deliver outside the US. Then there’s the light-drama game <b>Operation: Playground</b>. You’ll play kids with a creative kids view upon the world, which – at least for the kids – might as well be dramatically exciting.<br>
If you want your drama to be all about feudalism, try vying for the <b>Rebel Crown</b>. A Forged in the Dark Spiel about a claiment for the throne and their entcourage who have to brave feudal fights and intruige. Which I support, well pledged to. If you want your characters pledges to revenge a dead Queen, checkout the PbtA-inspired game <b>Our Queen Crumbles</b>. Like the magic aspects and the topic and thus recommend it.<br>
Changeling or fae courts are as well somewhat feudal, though I would describe them as rather fairy tale like. <b>Cold Iron</b> explores old folktales and stories for fantasy off the throtten paths of Tolkien and forms a really cool setting of it’s own. Check it out. Maybe you grew up on the Tales of Oz and are new in for <b>The New Tales of Oz</b>. I’ve only watched the Wizard of Oz movie, yet that zine looks really fascinating and as it has more to offer. I am keeping an eye on it. <b>Under The Floorboards</b> does cite „The Borrowers“ as its inspiration. Yet I personally do think it looks more along fairy tales like „Thumbelina“ or „The Steadfast Tin Soldier“ from my childhood. Anyway, I highly recommend it. I actually backed <b>Thistle and Hearth</b>, a game about belonging among outsiders with an intruiging take on Changelings. The PbtA playbooks spoke strongly to me.<br>
Maybe you feel your inner punk stirring up after so much fairytale stuff. <b>Punktopia</b> has you covered with punkrock adventures where you stick it to the man. YEAH! My Brujah heart wants to backe it, while my Ventrue brain points to my account. I might keep my inner punk to mixtapes and you you like those you should check out the <b>Monster Mix</b> RPG. Maybe you ain’t sure what to put on it and do a roadtrip with some soul searching first, which is covered in <b>i’m gonna be</b>. Well, and if you wanna gonna be on a concert and have some love drama check out <b>Oh No I’m Late to the MCR Concert &amp; I Have an Extra Ticket</b>.<br>
Maybe you are looking for a nice Space game for your kids. The <b>SPACE KIDS RPG</b> has you covered with some educational content and the <b>Space Goblins!</b> appear to be more focused on the fun side of things.<br>
Space Pulp, at least how I defined it, with Cronenberg-looking entries like <b>The Bone Age</b> are not that kids friendly, I guess. Neither is <b>Treasures of T’urokk</b> or <b>UNCONQUERED</b> – with the latter one pointing to being bronze-age sword &amp; sorcery &amp; sandales &amp; Sci-Fi mix.<br>
The currently funding Trophy game got a lot of spinoff games in this round of zines. With <b>Oligarchy</b> being my favorite. Kind of House of Cards as a ttrpg and presenting so convincingly that I not only went for a PDF option (as they don’t do international shipping) but got the main rpg. I didn’t manage to resist <b>Night Reign</b> – which focus on stealthy misdeeds – either and barely could say no to the nautical horrors of <b>Sunken</b>.<br>
The Urban Fantasy corner uses <b>SMALL TOWN: SKELETONS</b> to address the boring to the bone challenges of little towns. While the gm-less and one-shot based <b>Web-Slingers: Into the Worlds-Wide Web</b> essentially delivers a setting along Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse as Powered by the Apocalypse. The only thing I got about <b>THE VIOLET SANCTION</b> is that it’s Urban Fantasy and queerpunk. Other than that I literally can’t understand the project with its arbitary boldness and capitalization of letters. It gives me an headache. Well, and <b>Fruitless Existence</b> just managed to get me to my breaking point of „too much kickstarters“. Maybe people like to play horny, murderous fruits with a deathwish. It only gets a blank and disappointed stare from me.<br>
Then again, I do actually like and backed the Larp <b><span class="hashtag">#Flirtsquad</span></b>. Basically being about respectful (and successful? eh, nevermind, respectful!) flirting. Very good!<br>
There are many, many more cool projects. Like <b>The Watching Book</b>, which may serve as an Accessoire and ingame artefact or <b>Ancestry and Cultur</b>e, which offers interesting alternatives to the concept of „race“ in D&amp;D 5E. <b>The Accessible Gaming Quarterly</b> aims t make the hobby more inclusive, yet sadly is way out of my budget. I still recommend having a look. There’s supplements like <b>CRUACH</b> for adding swamps to Casket Lands um and <b>Inside Out</b> to add viscieral horror to games.<br>
