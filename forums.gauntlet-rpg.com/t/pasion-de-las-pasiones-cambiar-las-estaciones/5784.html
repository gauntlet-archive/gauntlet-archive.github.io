          <p><strong>NUMBER OF SESSIONS:</strong>  5 sessions total, being able to attend each session is strongly requested, you must RSVP to each session.</p>
<p><strong>DURATION:</strong>  3 hours</p>
<p><strong>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:</strong>  5, a seat is being reserved for Marleigh Norton</p>
<p><strong>CONTENT WARNING:</strong>  This game  <em>may</em>  include violence and how it can affect a life. If players consent, there may be themes of romance/sexual tension between player-controlled characters, and/or player and GM-controlled characters, but anything more explicit than a passionate kiss or embrace will be veiled. It may include separation or divorce. It could, if  <em>all</em>  players in the session give  <em>enthusiastic</em>  consent, include characters coming out and how people in their life react to it (both positively and negatively), or how that happened in the past and helped make them who they are today. It will explore aging and what happens as we age, and may include characters becoming disabled. It will explore relationships and how we try to support, sustain, and maintain them, as well as what happens to relationships when we neglect them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Players will assume the role of residents in Ciudad So√±ando who meet while working together in their late teens and early 20s.</p>
<p>Each session will jump forward about 10-15 years, from the fumbling steps toward adulthood in the late teens and early 20s, to a more mature period in the middle 30s, to the middle age of the mid-40s, to the characters in their mid-50s and early 60s, and finally old age, exploring stories of what happens at those stages of life, what we know and learn, and how we grow. It will, in some ways, be like a series of one-shots in which players play the same character. If players are unable to attend a session and someone else joins, they will be introduced as someone who met the other players at that stage of life, while the other character‚Äôs absence may be characterized as some form of estrangement, divorce, moving elsewhere for work, etc. If players need to miss a session, they‚Äôre encouraged to describe what their character is doing at that time of life that called them away.</p>
<p>Due to this structure, players should keep in mind that they may not resolve something in a session - it may be a relationship issue, a character struggling to come to terms with some integral aspect of who they are, and so on; it may pop up in a future session, it may be a regret of theirs, or it may be addressed as part of the ‚ÄúLast time on‚Äù mechanic. We‚Äôll quickly revisit relationship questions at the beginning of each session to see if characters want to change them (or if player attendance requires a change).</p>
<p><em><strong>If a player is unable to attend the last session, the fiction will explain that their character died, explain how, and other players can, if they choose, explore their reactions to that death.</strong></em></p>
<p>Players may need to do a bit of work creating NPCs outside of a session at times - for example, if they feel their character had children before the start of the second session, choosing the children‚Äôs names, ages, and rough personalities/interests (are they obedient/unruly, do they play youth baseball or soccer/football, etc.) before play starts will help keep the game moving.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SAFETY TOOLS IN USE:</strong>  This session will use a lengthy list of Lines and Veils to facilitate an initial baseline for player safety. Players are absolutely encouraged to add more topics to the list for their own safety. This session will also use the N-Card, X-Card, and Script Change as necessary to adjust the game while it‚Äôs in progress to maintain player safety. Finally, the Open Door Policy is always in effect and players may leave the game at any time for any length of time for any reason. This session will also adhere to The Gauntlet‚Äôs Community Code of Conduct: <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html</a></p>
<p><strong>RSVP OPEN ACCESS TIME:</strong>  09/03/2020 19:00 Central Time</p>
<p><strong>SET UP INFO:</strong>  We will use Streamyard for the event. Players should expect a reminder email approximately one week before the series starts.</p>
<p><strong>BREAKS:</strong>  2 five minute breaks</p>
<p><strong>RECORDED:</strong>  If all participants consent, it will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED:</strong>  No experience required, rules will be taught.</p>
