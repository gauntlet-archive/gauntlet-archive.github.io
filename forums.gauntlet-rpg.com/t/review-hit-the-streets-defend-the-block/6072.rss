    <title>Review: Hit the Streets: Defend the Block</title>

    <description>So, my friends in my RL gaming group have decided to start a website about tabletop RPGs with a mix of reviews, advice, or just whatever comes to mind. My first entry is a review of Hit the Streets by our own Richard Rogers. I also included a link to the Gauntlet game community page in the review as well. I hope you enjoy.
