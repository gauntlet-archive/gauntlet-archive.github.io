    <title>Tension: A Queer Cat and Mouse Romp (2 Mondays in January)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/tension-a-queer-cat-and-mouse-romp-2-mondays-in-january/6251</link>
    <description>Play as an investigator and a killer as they get entangled in each other, pursuing each other romantically and physically. Create a whole cast of characters in your orbit, building a map of relationships through play that begins to explode and fray in fabulous ways as people start dying!

Tension is not a mystery, it’s a dark comedy thriller romance. The killer and the investigator know who the other is, yet they are still inexplicably drawn together. Hijinks and drama ensue as they are trapped in a complicated web of attraction, lies, and even truth.

We&#39;ll be using the Ensemble optional role (which I will be filling) to inhabit the orbiting characters whenever they are introduced.
