*Broken*  is a tragic romance game for two players by Ben Wallis (thatgamerpriest).

We tell the story of a break-up. Together we will create the relationship and relationship dynamics between the two of us. We&#39;ll &quot;enjoy the new relationship energy, but explore the red flags emerging even in those early encounters. And over the course of ten scenes, [we] will explore the ways in which the things you loved about each other slowly slip away and dissolve until everything about your relationship is broken.&quot;

In  *Broken*  the relationship will always end. But while the tragic conclusion is inevitable, there is potential for healing and self-discovery along the way.

**What We Need**

You will need to gather a few elements to play  *Broken* .

● Ten breakable objects OR ten popsicle sticks
● 12 index cards
● Markers, pens, or pencils
● A recording device, like a memo recorder or smartphone
● A single candle and matches or lighter
● An X card

I am figuring out how to play this game over google Jamboard and Zoom (links sent a week before play). If you don&#39;t confirm over email, I&#39;ll reach out to people on the waitlist.

[The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.
