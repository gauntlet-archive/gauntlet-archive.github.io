Slings &amp; Arrows is about theatre people and how the show they&#39;re in seeps into their day jobs and personal lives. You&#39;ll create an Actor and, during the Show Phases, you&#39;ll create the plot of the original play you&#39;re performing in. We&#39;ll choose a genre and other details as a group before diving in to the play. During the Real Life Phases, the relationships you&#39;ve Staked during the play will be tested in ways thematic to the play. Playing a King whose country is falling down around their ears? In Real Life you may have a kid who refuses to listen and makes your home chaos.

You MUST be available for both sessions. You must RSVP each session you wish to attend.

This session is scheduled for 4 hours and will be recorded. We will likely play for 3, with breaks, and then get some feedback at the end.

Slings &amp; Arrow is a game I&#39;m developing based on the TV series of the same name. It would be nice if, after the session, you were available to give some feedback about what in the system worked or didn&#39;t work for you

We will be using the X-Card and Lines and Veils and will be playing in accordance with the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy. There is a tone, lines &amp; veils discussion as part of the creation of the play.
