    <title>Gauntlet Community Open Gaming: July Coming Up</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-community-open-gaming-july-coming-up/5459</link>
    <description>We&#39;re four weeks out from this event (7/16-7/19). Right now we have 18 events on the calendar, but it would be great if we could add more. If you&#39;re interested in running a session and aren&#39;t already set up as a GM on the GCOG Calendar, send me a message here or via edige23 at gmail. If you know others who might want to GM something, feel free to pass the information to them. Please tweet and reshare liberally. 

RSVPs for sessions open 7/6 at 10AM Eastern. GCOG is free and focused on introducing new players to online gaming and/or to games they might not have already played. You can see the events here: https://gauntlet-con.firebaseapp.com/events. For more information, folks can check out our overview page here: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/gauntlet-community-open-gaming.html
