    <description>*This is the rock and roll future of yesteryear that never was—and nobody wanted.*

*It is an intergalactic age of cowboys, outlaws and bandits playing on an interstellar stage.*

*It is a time of hyper-capitalism and a cutthroat gig economy.*

*Unreliable trash-heaps carry scrappy underdogs to their next gig,*

*and corporation freighters lumber across the horizon laden with an empire’s bounty.*

*The backstreets of every terraformed metropolis brim with a thousand lonely hearts*

*and a thousand more venal vendettas.*

*The burnt-out wastelands between bright lights are lawless bat countries*

*—anachronistic Americana languishing beneath multiple moons.*

*Madness lies in every direction at every solar hour.*

*These are the music-fuelled, moon-age daydreams of a rebel space age.*

This is session one of a two-shot of Orbital Blues using the  *Unchained Melody Quickstart* . We will make characters and begin the job.

As a system, Orbital Blues lands somewhere between story games and the OSR. Players will portray sad space cowboys who are down on their luck and in need of a job in a way the is reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop, Firefly, The Mandolorian, and maybe even a little Borderlands. It&#39;s hard out here at the edges of the galaxy and things can get pretty lethal.

I will send a reminder 1 week before the session. Rules will be taught. Being excited about sad music a plus, but not required.
