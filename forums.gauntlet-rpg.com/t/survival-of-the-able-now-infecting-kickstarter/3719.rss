The Black Death has come to your village. Everywhere around you people are succumbing to the plague. Quarantines are doing little to stem the tide of decay that is coming your way. Worst of all, you and the others in your almshouse have been left to fend for yourselves.

Oh, and did we mention plague victims are rising as zombies?

In Survival of the Able you’re a person with a disability living in a European almshouse when the Black Death arrives. Little is known about where the plague originated or how to stop it, but those who die from it are rising again—and they’re hungry for flesh. Since everyone else has succumbed to the plague, it’s up to a handful of you to make your way out of town and away to safety. You may not be the biggest, the strongest, or the fittest, but you&#39;re determined to survive.

## What is Survival of the Able?

Survival of the Able is a tabletop RPG about empathy. In this game, you will play as a person with a disability in the Middle Ages. The world isn’t very hospitable to you and your kind, and that’s before plague-ridden zombies started rising up to devour everyone around them. As you struggle for survival, you’ll get a feeling for what it is like to endure discrimination, to struggle with inaccessible surroundings, and to overcome adversity. This isn’t a game about heroic people and their heroic deeds. It’s a game about ordinary folks who have no choice but to challenge the stereotypes that keep them down. It’s a game about overcoming 14th Century plagues and 21st Century discrimination.

## About the Campaign

[Accessible Games](http://www.accessiblegames.biz) is raising $8,000 in 30 days to fund production for the book. The game is already written, but it needs art, editing, and layout to be complete. You can contribute to get a PDF, a printed book, a custom illustration, or an online game with the game’s designer.

Survival of the Able was developed by Jacob Wood, a blind game designer, and is being produced by other disabled and marginalized contributors.
