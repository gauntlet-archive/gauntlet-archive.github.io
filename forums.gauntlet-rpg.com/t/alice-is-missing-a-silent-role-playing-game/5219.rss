    <description>**Note: This session is being run by the designer Spenser Starke.**

***Alice Is Missing***  is a silent role playing game about the disappearance of a teenage girl in a small, Northern California town. During the game, players only communicate using their phones, sending text messages to each other as they unearth clues about what happened to Alice. Played over 90 minutes, the experience drops you into the town of Silent Falls and the lives of the people who live there as you investigate clues and solve mysteries-- until the game comes to an emotional and climactic end. With a full-length licensed soundtrack and a structured narrative that unravels solely at the hands of the players,  *Alice Is Missing*  is an immersive experience designed to to be played in one session and without the need for a gamemaster.

**Media Touchstones:**   *Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, Firewatch, Searching*

**IMPORTANT:**
This game requires the use of a smart phone that has the ability to send text messages and/or download the Discord app.

Pre-game communication will occur over email. Google Meet and Roll 20 (and possibly Discord) will be used during the session.

***Content and Trigger Warnings:***
*Alice Is Missing* inherently deals with topics of tense family dynamics, death, grief, helplessness, loss, and violence.

Session will last up to 3 1/2 hours. We will be using the X-Card and Lines &amp; Veils for safety during the game.
