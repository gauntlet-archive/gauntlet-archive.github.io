    <description>Die Harderer

“The year is 2023. Thirty-five years have passed since the terrorist attack on Nakatomi Plaza.

Nakatomi President Amanda Takagi is hosting a special holiday event for employees and their families - and the McClanes are invited!

Unfortunately, Hans Gruber and his new cadre of mercenaries have plans to crash the party. 

Make fists with your toes and grab your Twinkies and taglines - we’re in for a bumpy ride!”

Based on the original Die Hard movie, Die Harderer is a one-shot action-adventure game of a family coming together to do what they do best - kick ass.  We’ll be using either Fate Condensed or Accelerated for the ruleset. Pre-gens will be modified to fit character concepts.  Play as Lucy, Jack, Grandpa John, Al Powell or another extended family member.

SESSIONS: This is a one-shot.

DURATION: 4 hours.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Three players in addition to the facilitator.

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy, Stars &amp; Wishes. The game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

VENUE/TECH: Zoom Video, Roll20 for character sheets, etc. Expect an email one week before the first session with the Roll20 link, and another an hour or so before each session.

BREAKS: Three 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

RECORDING: Sessions will be recorded, but would only be posted with full enthusiastic player consent.  Currently the plan is to record only for the facilitator’s reference.

PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: None – rules will be taught in play.
