    <description>Hey folks!

I&#39;m launching my first Kickstarter! MERGER is a single-player RPG about macrocosmic corporate horror, using the forged in the dark system. It is a mash-up of capitalist critique and cosmic horror. It is a metaphor for living in late-stage capitalism, and it is also quite literal. Your character can see these corporate bodies for what they really are. They glimpse flesh in the cracks of the cement, see eyes looking back at them in the conference room, and can feel blood under their feet as they walk between skyscrapers.

Are they alone in this revelation? Will they attempt to leave the corporate body, or remain a cell in this immoral behemoth, biding their time to strike? Play to find out what happens!

[The preview page is now live, so please follow along to get notified when the project launches.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/notwriting/merger-0) This project is also part of [SideQuest2021](https://sidequest.info/), an organized effort by indie tabletop developers to bring  creators together to advertise their work as a community. Check out the website for more folks crowdfunding their games and supplements!
