    <description>**PLAYTEST: Naked City Blues**
***Naked City Blues***  is an in-development Powered by the Apocalypse role-playing game that tells hard-boiled detective stories as seen through the lens of film noir. The game is also &quot;Carved From Brindlewood,&quot; meaning that it shares many mechanics of  *Brindlewood Bay* , including an emergent mystery structure. I&#39;ll send a copy of the latest version of the rules to players a few days before this session.

This is a four-part series, running Thursday nights in January (8:00 PM EST). Attendance in all sessions is encouraged, but not required: You must sign up for each individual session.

Sessions will run three hours. We will be using the GM&#39;s Zoom for video chat, a shared Character Keeper on Google Docs, and Roll Dice With Friends as a shared dice roller.

If all players agree, the session will be recorded and posted for public viewing. 

**This series is a playtest. The game is very early in its development cycle.** While I hope that this will be a fun series in and of itself, I am primarily looking for honest feedback on the rules: I expect there to be rough edges and parts that don&#39;t work as intended. I also expect to make changes to the rules as needed during the course of the series. 

**Safety Tools** : We will be using Open Door, the X-Card, and Lines &amp; Veils. Lines &amp; Veils will be collected anonymously. This game complies with the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html). 

**Breaks:**  We&#39;ll take a five-minute break near the top of each hour, plus any other breaks as requested.

[Session One](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MLudpdwTVLhxS0IC6z6): Thu Jan 7, 2021, 8:00 PM EST
[Session Two](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-MLudrTMrwWPbOSQbN3h): Thu Jan 14, 2021, 8:00 PM EST

              <p>Hello, I just RSVP’d for the second two sessions. Is there any way I can sit in on the first two? Not to play, but just to watch (are you LIVEstreaming?)<br>
Thanks! I super look forward to it; this will be my first Gauntlet play</p>

              <p>I’ll also be interested in how you handle the multiple character issue, since most Noir is tightly focused on a single (usually male) character who is defined by autonomy/independence and separation from society.</p>
<p>How that translates into multiple players who all want to be the protagonist… seems like a challenge.</p>

              <p>Found it! Funny, but your playtest is on the same time as my Good Society games this month, so I couldn’t have participated this time, anyway.</p>
<p>But would love to hear the results, and if you do another, I’ll definitely look to sign up.</p>
