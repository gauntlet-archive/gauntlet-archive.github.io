    <description>Codex - Hell 2 Miscellany: Three Dozen Wars

We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Hell 2! This one is called “Three Dozen Wars (and How They Ended).”

Submissions should be no more than a short paragraph. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please avoid anything that seems like misogyny or sexual predation—we won’t publish stuff like that.

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

Importantly, submissions can be of any genre and can be any type of war, and must include information about how the war ended. Fantasy conflicts, science-fiction conflicts, real-world stuff—all of that and more is good. Actual military campaigns are great, but social conflicts and conflicts that don’t involve anyone dying are also a good fit here. Wars that would be in the history books of the world they took place in should also have a name.

Here are some examples:

“The War of Three Rivers, a conflict between a trio of noble families that dragged on for multiple generations. The three families gave the war its name: House Bernden had the image of a river on its coat of arms; the ancestral home of House Torenden was located in the bend of the great Toren river; and House Reverden, well, that one’s a bit less clear, but it’s most likely the fact that &#39;rever&#39; sounds kind of like &#39;river&#39; (it’s best not to think too hard on these things). The war ended when members of the fourth generation of each family to be involved in the conflict got together and, after some discussion, realized they could no longer agree on what originally started the war in the first place, and figured it was best to just set the whole thing aside.” 

“For years, the Duchess of Seradynne was unrivaled in her ability to spread malicious gossip. With a few choice words, spoken to a few choice people, she could ruin reputations, turn the meek into the mighty, and bring whole kingdoms to their knees. But then the Duchess met her match in a minor royal, Prince Theo of Thaynne. For months, the Duchess and Prince circled one another, positioning themselves to glean the best bits of scandalous information at the expense of the other. Their rivalry was officially commenced when they tried to see which of them could more quickly ruin the reputation of the old Countess of Bernden, a woman neither of them had met. After months of effort on both sides, the contest ended when they realized the Countess was a shameless drinker and fornicator, and didn’t give a fig for their ridiculous parlor games.”

              <p>(Another Battle of the Hosts)</p>
<p>The Whiskey Wars waged for a mere 5 months, but to those involved it felt like decades. It started at the debut of Lady Weanne, which was so grand that the partying lasted 17 days, and consumed 17 casks of good rye. Not to be outdone, Lady Ifera’s mother threw a party lasting 18 days and consuming 18 casks of infused bourbon for her daughter’s debut the next summer. After that, the battle was on, with Weanne and Ifera each trying to outdo the other with elaborate celebrations, sometimes overlapping.</p>
<p>It came to a head one day, when Weanne issued an invitation for a grand brunch the morning after a stargazing party at Ifera’s. Their shared guests, too hungover to join them, mostly stayed home, and Ifera arrived alone, in a snit. She demanded to know why Weanne kept throwing these parties, and Weanne, still drunk on scotch from the night before, said something along the lines of “because of you”. The guests who showed up more than an hour later found the two of them cuddling on a divan, and the ridiculous invitations stopped immediately. Everyone was quite relieved, except for a handful of charlatans selling hangover cures.</p>

This new alliance gave Bismarck access to trained Mizorian dinosaur cavalry, and when fitted with modern weapons, became the infamous German “Dragon Dragoons”. The Mizorian alliance also provided Germany with vast supplies of “lifting gas” (helium), which allowed construction of a fleet of war zeppelins. With both land and air superiority, the German Empire conquered the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and ultimately all of France. German expansion into Iberia was kept in check by the Spanish subterranean allies, the Giants of Avatabar, who held the Pyrenees.</p>

              <p>The Felwith Sewer War began when the Lord-Mayor of Felwith Town became fed up with the “infestation” of goblins in the sewers, and declared a bounty of five gold sovereigns per goblin head delivered to Town Hall. The Thieves’ Guild saw an opportunity, and allied with the Mudeater Gang of sewer goblins, assisting them with their ongoing aggression against the larger Pigsticker Tribe. The Guild collected the heads of the fallen goblins on both sides, turning a tidy profit… until they discovered that the corrupt City Watch had made a similar arrangement with the Pigstickers. This caused months of underground skirmishes between the Thieves Guild and the City Watch—and their goblin proxies—until the goblins allied with each other and turned on their erstwhile human benefactors. After the goblins slew both the Captain of the Watch and the Guildmistress, the Lord-Mayor called off the bounty and sued for peace.</p>

              <p>History Search: Algorithm Rivalry of 2052<br>
Top Result: GoozlePlex Lycanos Search Engine War<br>
In the early months of 2052, GoozlePlex LLC and Lycanos Corp began competing with each other for search engine supremacy on the World Net, utilizing their influence to begin shifting views onto more and more disparate content services. In a bold move by Lycanos, they entered a joint media distribution sharing agreement with Fennic Futures distribution, shutting GoozlePlex out of the multimedia market.  In retaliation, GoozlePlex utilized their connections to the US Government to create and funnel financial transactions through their systems, thus causing any attempts to purchase media to be tarrifed unless it also was stored on GoozlePlex servers.  This continuing escalation resulted in a rise of piracy and encryption systems, and lead to the current black hat culture taught in most magnet schools and other private institutions, as any capable youth needs to learn to navigate the BlackNet in order to receive both a paycheck for the continuing corporate espionage jobs each company sponsors on the other as “bug bounty” hunts, and devour the up-to-date pop culture necessary to keep up with their age bracket.</p>

All seven followed the same hyperbolic trajectory at a speed significantly faster than solar escape velocity: They were clearly of extra-solar origin. The asteroids were also equally spaced, at 13,419 km apart. Projections indicated that all would impact the Earth, any one of which would be an extinction-level event. Fortunately, the UN had passed the International Asteroid Defense Treaty nearly twenty years earlier, and a coalition of spacefaring nations was able to destroy or deflect all seven: None hit the Earth. Scientists could not come up with any natural phenomenon that would cause this event. Which raised the question: Was this an act of war? And if so… from whom?</p>

Early on she would eat there and speak loudly about how the pie was so similar to her own, often to a confused waitstaff. After ownership had her forced out over one particularly vocal tantrum, she bought all the blueberries from nearby food suppliers, causing a menu change for a whole week (she was so proud). The final battle, and her Waterloo, was when the diner submitted their pie for the '99 town fair. It was only after a niece explained to her what the “vegan” tag on the diner pie meant that she relented, “Well I make my crust with lard!” Aunt Jen said. She never mentions that the diner pie went on to win blue ribbon at the state fair.</p>

              <p>Tarragon Brewster waited patiently by the hole in the wall she had seen Squeaker enter two hours before. She had chased off or killed all of the other members of The Rats, the worst gang she had ever had to hunt down, so she had plenty of time, but Squeaker’s hours were numbered. The sun was starting to set, casting long shadows. Squeaker should be coming out any time now. Tarragon’s tail twitched, almost as it if it had a mind of its own. She didn’t need people to set traps. She was a hunter, and by the end of the night, her house would be free of rodents, one way or another.</p>

              <p>The Magisterium’s fleet had assembled in orbit around Archon IV, ready to defend a vital resupply point against an attack that spies watching The Children Of Invictus had predicted was imminent. While the spies were correct, none of them had anticipated the shocking nature of the attack. A single drone ship appeared and used a modified matter driver to launch a projectile of nearly infinite mass into Terrico, the star that Archon IV orbited, causing the star to implode and suck every object in the system into the resulting singularity. The remnants of The Magisterium’s fleet were scattered across the galaxy, unable to mount any meaningful form of counterattack, and The Magisterium quickly surrendered.</p>

              <p>Lord Namar, who ascended to his throne when he was but 12, got it into his head that a town in the fiefdom of Leval was his, simply because it shared his name. He gathered up all of his armies, and lead them, on a pony he was scarcely tall enough to ride, into a long crusade across the country, out to claim the town of Namar, and a 10 foot wide strip of land connecting his fiefdom to the town, intending to bisect several interstitial fiefdoms. As the young lord was an ineffective strategist, his men-at-arms did most of the commanding, and so the crusade was relatively bloodless - aside from a few bulls who resented the encroachment onto their pastures, but that could be made right with the exchange of a few coins. Ultimately, the neighboring lord viewed the encroachment mostly with amusement, and built a small folly titled “the triumph of Namar” in the army’s path, which amused Namar so much he forgot about his intended target. Ultimately, Namar married that neighboring lord’s daughter, and blushes everytime his childhood military campaign is brought up at family reunions.</p>

              <p>No one could remember why The War Of The Grim started, but it had raged for a generation and a half and had taken such a toll on both the Hlalil and Gurovar empires that they had both resorted to conscripting children. That meant forging weapons and armor for soldiers who were barely 12 hands tall. The war continued until two ten-year-olds whose names have been forgotten met on the field of battle. They were both dirty, covered in blood, and almost too exhausted to raise their swords again. They fell against each other in a grapple, swaying almost like lovers dancing, trying to gain any advantage, until one broke wind and it echoed in their armor, reverberating off the metal. The other tried to stifle a giggle, which resulted in a snort. Before long, they had both fallen to the ground, howling with laughter at the absurdity of it all. Their comrades joined in the mirth and, no matter how the generals yelled, their power was broken forever and peace inevitably followed.</p>

Two powerful Elizabeths set their sights on him: Lady Elizabeth Dupree, and Sir Elizabeth of Antegonne. For years they held lavish parties and exotic hunting retreats, throwing famous snits when the duke would visit one and not the other. Duke Serafend, for his part, appeared not to notice the rivalry. The war ended when both Elizabeths met their tragic end in the same year: Lady Elizabeth Dupree died of indigestion, and Sir Elizabeth of Antegonne was run through by a boar on a hunt. For his part, Duke Serafend made a love match with a third, title-less Elizabeth, and everyone reports that they’re very happy together.</p>

The two franchises battled each other with competing specials, coupons, special events (Like the short-lived Beer 4 Dadz promotion) and even rumored industrial espionage. The battle ended abruptly in March of 1983 when Ward Browerly, CFO for P4K was found dead in a limo parked outside a high-end Bangkok casino, having lost somewhere north of a million dollars betting on college basketball.

              <p>In the 1980s, the “Cola Wars” between the Coca-Cola Corporation and PepsiCo were really just competing advertising campaigns. But for a few months in 1986, they could have gotten “hot,” as PepsiCo briefly owned the sixth-largest navy in the world! How? Citizens of the Soviet Union had acquired a strong taste for Pepsi in the 1960s. At the time, the Soviet government had signed an in-kind payment agreement, trading Russian vodka for American soda pop. However, by 1986, there were enough competitors in the American vodka market that the Soviets weren’t able to offer enough vodka to slake their thirst for Pepsi. So the Soviets traded a fleet of mothballed WWII-vintage naval vessels for $3B worth of Pepsi products. Until PepsiCo arranged for the ships to be sold for scrap, they briefly commanded a fleet of 17 submarines, a cruiser, a frigate, and a destroyer!</p>

<p>In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union wanted to have Pepsi on hand permanently. But paying was an issue, so Moscow came up with a creative solution.</p>
