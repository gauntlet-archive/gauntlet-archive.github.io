**This series is a continuation of an off-Gauntlet game, but we will be pulling from the wait list if a player is unable to make it!** You do not need to be familiar with the game system or story so far to jump right in, we&#39;ll take good care of you! I will email everyone on the RSVP list to confirm attendance. In case someone needs to drop, I will reach out to folks on the wait list!

***This is a series that will span three different game systems to tell one story: the story of the Brinkwood and the brigands who dare to face on vampire lords. This is an experimental series and players should be willing to be flexible with playing any of the systems.***

***In The Face Of Our Despair:*** a collaborative storytelling game about a group of fae guardians fighting a doomed war in a forest that falls to vampiric corruption. A one shot to tell the tale of the fallen fae, a doomed forest, and the fae Mask it created. We will have one game of this per season to serve as a prequel or flashback.

***Brinkwood: Blood of Tyrants:*** You are a brigand, a commoner radicalized by tragedy who has decided to forsake their old life and flee into the woods to plot a rebellion. Cardenfell is your home, a kingdom on the brink of open revolt against the vampiric nobles and factory lords who rule over it. All it will take is a single spark. Your spark. Whether you&#39;re robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, or assassinating vampires and drinking their blood, every move you make will take you closer to your goal: liberating your home from the vampiric scourge of blood rent and exploitation. We will play 2-3 sessions of Brinkwood: Blood of Tyrants per season, to serve as the main storyline of the game.

***Brinkwood: Refuge* :** The Refuge is the last place in Cardenfell that is safe from the vampires. It is the quiet heart of the rebellion. Stories told in Refuge will focus on healing from trauma, building relationships, facing the past, and inviting a brighter future. We will play 1-2 sessions of Refuge between forays and play out some of the relationships and NPCs, to serve as the side stories of the game.

**CW: War, trauma, violence, tragedy that lead to radicalization, systemic oppression, romance.**

**Systems**  : **Brinkwood: The Blood of Tyrants** (Forged in the Dark), **In The Face of Our Despair** (Rooted in Trophy) **Refuge: Brinkwood** (Belonging Outside Belonging)

**Duration**  : Five 3 hour sessions

**Breaks**  : 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : Yes, but only if all players consent to recording and publishing

**Attendance**  : Joining all sessions is ideal but not required, this game is very drop in and drop out friendly. If you are going to play in Brinkwood: Blood of Tyrants, I will contact you to help you quickly put together a character before the game.

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, an open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

**Reservation:** A seat has been reserved for Josh Hittie

**Open access** : Public signs up are available at 10/16/2020 9AM (Manila Time)
