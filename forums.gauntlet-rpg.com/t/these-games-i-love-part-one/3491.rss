              <p>If you haven’t read this and you had tough school years, I am sure you can relate to this entry.  It’s a great blog entry!  My first rpg was also Marvel Super Heroes with my best (and only friend) when I moved states in middle school.  The stories he told using this system were ridiculous and AMAZING!  It almost makes me nostalgic for middle school nowadays.  I have forgotten nearly all of the little shits that gave new kids a hard time.  Instead, my mind takes me back  frequently to all those free weekends full of stories through rpgs with a great friend.</p>
