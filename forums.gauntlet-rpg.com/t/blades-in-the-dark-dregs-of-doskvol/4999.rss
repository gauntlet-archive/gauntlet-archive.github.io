    <title>Blades in the Dark: Dregs of Doskvol</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/blades-in-the-dark-dregs-of-doskvol/4999</link>
    <description>Doskvol is a crooked city full of all kinds of criminal organizations. You are a member of one of the newest and weakest. Can you rise out of the dregs of the city and carve a niche for your group?

Play to find out in Blades in the Dark. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. 

This game will be run in accordance with the Gauntlet inclusivity policy. We will have a tone and content discussion before the game begins, including setting out lines and veils. 

The session is scheduled for around 3 hours and will be recorded and uploaded if everyone agrees to it.

If players are interested, the campaign may extend into July
