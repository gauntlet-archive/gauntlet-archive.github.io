    <title>Hearts of the Road (Supernatural + Hearts of Wulin) (3 sessions in April)</title>

    <description>&quot;There has been blood at the Last Call roadhouse, somewhere in Montana ... lots of Hunters there, you see, lots of weapons, lots of folks used to violence, and some joker thought it was a good idea to hold an auction of a cursed hat, a blessed knife, and a mercurial compass there. Who was there? Them Harcourts, right, those city slickers who&#39;ll just hunt to make dough, and them Sutters, from way down Kentucky, who know all kinds of weird Jesus lore - started explosive, and then add a werewolf, a doppelganger, and - so they say - an actual effing demon to the mix ... well, don&#39;t go down there, friend. Nothing but ghosts around there anymore.&quot;

This is a game of three sessions in the setting of the tv show Supernatural with the rules of Hearts of Wulin. This is a bit experimental, and we&#39;ll have to adapt a few things from &quot;wuxia&quot; to &quot;monster hunters&quot;, but - in the end - both are about duty, and family, and how hard it is to talk frankly about feelings. So it might work, but it also could be a bit rough. This is a playtest of this combination, so some we might have to deal with a few glitches here and there.

Puckett will be a guest for these sessions.

**System**  : Hearts of Wulin (fantastic rules with a few tweaks)

**Duration**  : Three 3 hour sessions

**Breaks**  : 1 on top of every hour

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : No

**Attendance**  : Joining all sessions is recommended. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open-door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

**Content Warnings** : There will be violence, and blood, and probably some family drama. Lines &amp; Veils will still apply!
