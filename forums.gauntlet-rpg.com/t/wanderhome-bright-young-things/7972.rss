This is a run of [Wanderhome](https://possumcreekgames.com/en-gb/pages/wanderhome), a game of travel and talking animals by [Jay Dragon](https://twitter.com/jdragsky) and published by Possum Creek Games. This game will run through April and May, running at the same time on Sunday evenings (UK time). This game will be run with an open table - feel free to sign up for as many or few sessions as you wish. Further to this, as a game that does not seek to create an overarching plot, I would encourage players to take the odd break, particularly if there is a healthy waitlist and it will give another player a chance to play. I am listing sessions at 3.5 hours in length, though I imagine we won’t always use the full length of time - I just want to allow enough time to onboard new players if we do see a frequently changing cast. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (March 28th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

Wanderhome is a game of Belonging Outside Belonging by Jay Dragon. In it, we will all take on the roles of animal-folk traveling together through the land of Haeth. We will meet new people, see strange sights, and share with one another. It’s a game that is specifically not focused on big sweeping narratives or drama, focusing on the smaller moments and a slice-of-life experience. It is a collaborative game, and though I will be facilitating play, there is no split in power/responsibility between the players. It is likely I will miss one, possibly two, sessions in May, though I am keen for the game to continue in my absence!  

Content Warnings: This is not a game that centres violence in play, though the world is in the wake of a war, and some wartime experiences are features of some of the playbooks. But we will avoid graphic depictions of violence regardless. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
