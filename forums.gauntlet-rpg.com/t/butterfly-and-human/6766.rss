    <description>I crammed a submission through the deadline-hole of the Pleasure-not-Business Card Jam on itch.io. 

Butterfly and Human is more in line with a thought experiment, but I figured it might make for some quick interesting stories for 1-2 people. 

If anyone tries it, lemme know how it went.</description>
