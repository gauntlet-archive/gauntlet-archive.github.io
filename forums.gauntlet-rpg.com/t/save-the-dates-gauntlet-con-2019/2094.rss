    <description>Gauntlet Con is back this October, so save the dates!

The first games will start at [date=2019-10-24 time=14:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] and the last games will wrap up by [date=2019-10-27 time=23:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]. Gauntlet Con is an entirely online con with participants in many timezones and countries. The con organizing team is currently working on panels, workshops, guests, prizes, and -- of course -- many, many games.
