    <description># **For the first 24 hours please only sign up if you’re new to the Gauntlet (i.e. joined this year). After that anyone may sign up.**
This will be a three session series Saturday mornings US Eastern in December, with the first session as part of SWS:SE. It will be a reimagining of the story after *Star Wars Episode VIII The Last Jedi* and will offer a new finish of the trilogy. The only things canon will be the first two movies of the trilogy, as well as the original trilogy. Attendance at all three sessions is ***strongly encouraged***.

We will be using  *Hearts of Wulin*, with pre-gens for the existing characters.
* Rey
* Finn
* Rose Tico
* Poe Dameron
* Chewbacca
* Princess Leia

The only requirement will be that someone has to play Rey.Each session will be one act of the “movie”—and we will start with some choices for initial incident and direction. In session one you’ll tweak your pre-gen, set up where we begin and get to playing. One seat is being reserved.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools. If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
