    <title>Trophy - Risk roll</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/trophy-risk-roll/2327</link>
    <description>As far as I understand, there is a difference in how risk rolls work in Trophy and doing things in Cthulhu dark works:

In Cthulhu dark, you have at least one die when doing things, one could possibly do. 

In Trophy it seems, you have either a skill to accomplish something or you have to accept a devil&#39;s bargain if you don&#39;t want to loose your mind?

Is that correct?

Say, I want to enter a closed hut: nobody is able to simply pick / break the lock (afaics there is no according skill) or have I overlooked something here? 

Is it handwaved like this? 
* In case you simply want to enter, no risk is taken. Do it! 

* If it is risky (and you are doomed anyways) and bad sh.t is going to happen if you enter (or if you don&#39;t enter this hut silently) of course it is possible  you get more ruined or you have to accept a devil&#39;s bargain. 

Or is it simply: in this forest, there is no &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;simply&quot;, so everything out of your routine should be dangerous?</description>

              <p>Thanks! I was contrasting hand-to-hand combat with rituals or other more creative solutions, which a GM might allow you to attempt. If you face a monstrosity with nothing but a blade, though, you’re dead.</p>
<p>Again, you can roll to try to run past a monstrosity, or fight it just to enough to get away, but you can’t kill it through normal means.</p>

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/jesseross">@jesseross</a> for making this great game <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"><br>
I just listened to the episode of “The hard move” podcast, where you were invited to talk about trophy which was nice.</p>
<p>May I ask an additional question?</p>
<p>What does it mean, when it is says, that if one fights the forest’s monstrosities “in hand-to-hand combat” one is going to die?</p>
<p>This doesn’t imply, that weapons are successful solutions, does it? As with Cthulhu Dark, I think, weapons are of no use here. And there are too no explicit combat rules.</p>
<p>OTOH, I could imagine allowing weapons against monstrosities alongside with a devil’s bargain causing unintended harm to yourselves or the fellow trophy hunters.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

              <p>Yep – you and Jim have got it exactly right. If it’s not risky, you don’t roll. if it is risky, you can either roll a light die by accepting a Devil’s Bargain (which doesn’t automatically risk increasing your Ruin), or you can take a dark die and risk increasing your Ruin.</p>

<p>Which is very likely in the beginning.</p>
<p>That said, I now see, that the rules enforce a tight dramatic evaluation of the outcome and could increase the feeling of being doomed, which in turn demands from me, the GM, setting things accordingly up.</p>

<p>You roll a LIGHT die if you are skilled at whatever task you’re trying, from your occupation or background. You can also roll a LIGHT die if you accept a Devil’s Bargain. (For either your first light die or to add a second one)</p>
<p>You MAY add a DARK die if you’re willing to risk Mind and/or Body. You can add extra DARK dice and reroll if you don’t like your result, and a DARK die isn’t the highest result.</p>
<p>Whatever you settle on,if your DARK die is the highest, it  counts as an automatic RUIN roll and you go from there.</p>
