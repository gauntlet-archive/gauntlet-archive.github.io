              <p>To be clear, you get a confirmation email when you RSVP, not when you waitlist. However, when you come off of the waitlist (to an RSVPed status) you should get an email confirming that you are now RSVPed.</p>
<p>And then as Alun said! Ideally the facilitator will indicate when and how they’ll contact everyone prior to the session in the game listing.</p>

              <p>When you RSVP you will get an automated email confirming to whichever email address you used to register with the Calendar.</p>
<p>The facilitator then reaches out to players in advance of the session, but exactly how far in advance will depend on their taste … I usually email players 5-7 days in advance with links to play materials and details of how I’ll be in touch with links to the game at the published start time … usually I set up a hangouts chat group for players so we have somewhere to ask questions in advance and discuss the upcoming game.  Others will come at those pre-session details differently …</p>

<p>I’m trying to create an account on the Gauntlet Hangouts page, but I can’t figure out how. When I click the “Login” button, a popup window opens that asks me to choose one of my Google accounts to use to log in with. If I instead choose “Create account” on that popup it offers me to create a new Google account.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is something in my settings or something on the page, but whatever I choose I end up at the same place - back on the page, not logged in, and without the ability to create an account on the page.</p>

              <p>Gauntlet Hangouts is the name of our gaming calendar. Games are run online, usually using Google Hangouts, but sometimes Roll 20 or similar. Folks who are $8+ Patrons of The Gauntlet have RSVP priority to new game listings. Otherwise, anyone with some basic tech requirements (stable internet, a mic) can join a game.</p>

              <p>I’m no expert but as I understand it …<br>
Access to book games is restricted to Patreon supporters at a particular level for about a week after games are posted - after that I think anyone can go to <a href="https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/events" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/events</a>, and RSVP.</p>
<p>Games are also being posted on the Forums.</p>
<p>All times are in the timezone associated with the Google account you register with, and there’s even a calendar that shows you which games currently have spaces as they show up as green dots.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t worry if there’s not a space as you can RSVP and join the waitlist and a lot of people get into games that way as original bookers discover real life has intervened.</p>

              <p>You sign up for games at the Gauntlet Hangouts Firebase site:</p>
<p><a href="https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/</a></p>
<p>You will need to create an account there to sign up for games. People who support the Gauntlet on Patreon by paying $8 a month or more get priority access to sign up for games. That is, they can sign up for games as soon as they’re posted to the site; people without priority access can only sign up for games after they’ve been posted for a week, by which point a large majority of games are full. The waitlist is often short or empty, though, even after a week, and games often fill from the waitlist.</p>
