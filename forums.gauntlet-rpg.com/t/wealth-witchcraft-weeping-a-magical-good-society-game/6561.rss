    <title>Wealth, Witchcraft &amp; Weeping - A Magical Good Society game</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/wealth-witchcraft-weeping-a-magical-good-society-game/6561</link>
    <description>*The lively village of Greater Wylford lies at the foot of the Greer-Blythe University for Grammar &amp; High Witchcraft , and many of the professors, their spouses, their children, and their other family live here. This is, after all, where Pernithea Greer-Blythe was born and raised - the fabled witch who delivered England from the French chrono-mancers, and the German stone-masons! The very founder of the great university still has decendents here, if you can image, and if one is lucky, one might garner an invitation to one of their fabled birthday parties! There are rumours of hedge magicians in the village, of a fairie hillock, and of a group of civilized demons, and of at least one child of a pagan god, but these surely do not make very good company to a proper member of society....*

This is a game of **Good Society: Pride, Prejudice, and Practical Magics** I will facilitate over a course of four games during April. Good Society is a game set in Jane Austen&#39;s Regency England, in the upper strata of society, and deals with romance and making one&#39;s way in the world. In this iteration, there will also be a healthy dash of magic - what that looks like (high Hermetic magic or folksy witching songs, e.g.) and how it is expressed in society is something we will define in the first session. There are some suggestions in the fluff text above, but they are not canon!

Being able to attend all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

No experience is needed (neither in the game nor in the literary world of Jane Austen); everything will be taught in the game.

Anders Gabrielsson will be a guest of honour for this game!

Venue: Zoom

Contact: Players will receive an e-mail to check in about a week before the start of the game.

We will discuss Content, Aim, Tone, and Safety Tools in the first sessions. We will use Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door policy, and I will prepare a character keeper as a shared document.

The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in effect for this game (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)!
