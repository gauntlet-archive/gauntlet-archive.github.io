On the Gauntlet Blog today I talk about my reskin of *Mutant: Year Zero* for a *Sid Meier Alpha Centauri* rpg. One of my face to face groups had chosen that a couple of months ago. I figured I had time to put that together given my time off for surgical recovery. Cut to my mad rush to get stuff put together from last Thursday onwards.

**[Age of Ravens: Colony Zero](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-colony-zero)**

This post focuses on characters. I went with nine possible roles, stealing liberally from various games using the *Mutant Engine*. But I also added in some new elements. Each character also choose a faction they belong to, which gives them some additional stuff and helps set the stage for the colony itself. I&#39;m pretty happy with how it ran at the table and I hope others might find some useful bits there.</description>
