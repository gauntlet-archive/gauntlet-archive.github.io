    <title>What game would you recommend for someone suffering from OSR/PbtA burnout?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/what-game-would-you-recommend-for-someone-suffering-from-osr-pbta-burnout/1803</link>
    <description>Disclaimer: I love a lot of OSR and PbtA games, but I&#39;m tired of reading so many games with so many things in common system-wise.

To me, reading Blades in the Dark last year was very refreshing. Even though lots of things can be seen as PbtA-like (like the whole failure/partial success/success mechanic for tests), there are a lot of new interesting mechanics (although I assume I might get burnt-out on those when I start reading other Forged in the Dark games...). I also loved Dream Askew/Dream Apart for the same reason (still reminds me of PbtA, but is diceless, GMless, and includes &quot;playbooks&quot; for aspects of the world).

What are recent games you&#39;ve read that build on more &quot;modern&quot; game design and diverge from the PbtA and OSR scenes? What is exciting about those games?</description>

              <p>Troika!</p>
<p>I’ll give a brief breakdown, but I think you’d be better off reading Zedeck Siew’s <a href="https://zedecksiew.tumblr.com/post/183933450206/troika" rel="nofollow noopener">terrific post about it</a>. While you’re at it, read everything else he’s ever written if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>Troika! is partly inspired by British RPGs of yore, and partly from Planescape mixed with Peyote. Thematically it’s completely out of this world, and my mind has already expanded just by reading it. The book art will also remove any remaining bits of doubt that this is something utterly original.</p>
<p>Essentially you roll on a d66 table to produce a completely random and “out there” character, loosely defined by a description and some starting Skills &amp; items.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="//gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d72dcdcc4637cc722f183139a5824db607203532.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/uHyN0RdYS59Oo10udkTscqJmwMO.jpeg?dl=1" title="image" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="//gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/d/d72dcdcc4637cc722f183139a5824db607203532_2_468x500.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="uHyN0RdYS59Oo10udkTscqJmwMO" width="468" height="500" srcset="//gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/d/d72dcdcc4637cc722f183139a5824db607203532_2_468x500.jpeg, //gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/d/d72dcdcc4637cc722f183139a5824db607203532_2_702x750.jpeg 1.5x, //gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/d/d72dcdcc4637cc722f183139a5824db607203532.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="//gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/optimized/2X/d/d72dcdcc4637cc722f183139a5824db607203532_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>There is a simple dice mechanic for most actions (including Spells), a slightly modified version for combat, and then a completely original Initiative and Inventory system that will make you scratch your chin at first. Then you realize how… tense it makes things, and how crazy it is that this uber rules-lite game has tiny crunchy (and likely optional) mechanics for these usually hand-waived components.</p>
<p>I could say more, but really it’s kind of amazing and everyone should read it.</p>

It has a brilliant resolution mechanic using Fate dice in a new and cool way, and it promotes collaboration at the table while also strongly structuring the narrative of the game. It also has a evocative card based mechanic for doing fight and chase scenes, and plays through a whole movie in one session. I ran it at GauntletCon last year and it was a big hit with the players!</p>

<p><a href="https://itrasby.com/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Itras By</em></a> is a surrealist game that uses custom decks of cards for resolution and to introduce fantastic elements. It’s corny to say, but every time I’ve played or run it, I’ve seen something beautiful about the human condition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldswithoutmaster.com/swords-without-master" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Swords Without Master</em></a> perfectly emulates Sword and Sorcery fiction using different micro-games and two dice, one for Glum and one for Jovial. Of all the games I’ve played, I think it gives you the greatest license to narrate amazing events.</p>

I often skim rpg books, but as with <em>Blades in the Dark</em> I found myself working through the whole thing. <em>Ryuutama</em>’s also quite good and an example of a striking different way of approaching design. Finally, even if you’re not into <em>Fate</em>, Evil Hat has some recent projects worth looking at. <em>Uprising</em>, based on the universe of <em>The Resistance</em> card game, has a lot of cool ideas about handling characters working at cross purposes. Several of the recent Fate Worlds of Adventure (<em>Clockwinders, Iron Street Combat, Til Dawn</em>) showcase great writers doing tight world-building and presentation. They have the added advantage of being PWyW on Drivethru.</p>

              <p>While we’re at horror games, I would mention Trophy by <a class="mention" href="/u/jesseross">@jesseross</a> - the character creation is very simple, the game is very chilling,  and the game structure is absolutely neat and I love it.</p>
<p>If you want something even more free-form, you can’t go wrong with Archipelago III. Card-drawing is the only randomizer, and the story prompts are just there to guide you into making something even more dramatic.</p>
<p>For slice-of-life games, I really like <a class="mention" href="/u/luiz">@Luiz</a>’s Melody of a Never-ending Summer, which centers on a group of teenagers training little monsters, building up various projects and finding friends.</p>

              <p>Not exactly what you asked for but maybe this is working for you, too: I like to read very old games from time to time, like eating ginger between sushi rolls, to neutralize this “new/light” feeling.<br>
Latest example is Bushido which I wanted to own for decades and I find very hard to read and grasp. Coming back to Blades or PbtA or OSR gives me a light feeling and new energy. And… you always can learn something from the old games, not only setting-wsie but mechanics, too.</p>

              <p>I’ve recently become deeply enamored with <a href="https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/good-society/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Good Society</em></a>. It is 100% character-focused and uses an incredibly light framework to tell engaging stories. Characters begin play with a desire, a relationship to another main character, reputation tags, and some affiliated side characters called Connections, who have their own limited resources to affect the narrative. Part of them get played by other players.</p>
<p>With the aid of the facilitator (who might play a main character as well), players frame scenes and do free roleplay to advance their goals, using Resolve Tokens to bargain with other players to manipulate the narrative according to their agenda. Orchestrating your character’s struggles is one of the player principles.</p>
<p>I went in not expecting anything (I wasn’t particularly interested in the subject matter — Jane Austen novels), and it has quickly turned into one of my favorite games. But any game that has dramatic monologues and letters as part of the rules was bound to win me over.</p>

It is <em>hard</em> to get the feel of an American Western right in a game in my opinion, but Keith nails a very particular Western story in this game. It has a kind of influence economy which I don’t recall seeing elsewhere. It uses Keys from <em>Shadow of Yesterday</em>. And it forces all conflicts to be dealt with by having the players come to an agreement over what is going to be the final result. And if they can’t, the GM will decide and it will be bad for both parties.</p>
<p>The other game that comes to mind is Stephen Dewey’s <a href="http://cavalrygames.com/shop/to-serve-her-wintry-hunger" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>To Serve Her Wintry Hunger</em></a> The dice collection mechanics do a really great job of reinforcing the feelings of hierarchy and favoritism. And of course ritual phrases.</p>
<p>Interestingly both of these are games that require an exact number of players (5 and 4 respectively).</p>

              <p>My favorite game of last year was <a href="https://thornygames.com/pages/dialect" rel="nofollow noopener">Dialect</a>. It’s a sombre game about a community in isolation. They have a language that is all their own. During the game you build/discover* the language through the lens of the characters. Throughout the game the language will die. This usually happens in one of two ways. The community getting re-integrated into society. The community dying out. Either way the language dies. There is a <a href="https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/3904/dialect" rel="nofollow noopener">new roll20 module</a> coming out tomorrow (April 19th, 2019), so you don’t have to go through all the work of building the decks yourself.</p>
<p>*I might argue that some of these words always existed in the community and the players are only just learning about them through play</p>
