    <title>Codex - Sunlight Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-sunlight-miscellany/995</link>
    <description>It’s the first official Gauntlet Forum Miscellany! Woo! This one’s for Codex - Sunlight and titled “Three Dozen Strange Plants and Their Uses.”

Submissions need to be a single sentence, or 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you&#39;re agreeing to let us use it (you&#39;ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Here are some examples:

“The sturdiest ropes are made of Witch’s Lace, a distinctive ruffled, holey seaweed, but only the most dedicated—or desperate—adventurers choose to carry it and its unshakeable scent of low-tide rot.”

“Bone violets are pale, crinkled mushrooms with what might charitably be called a delicate flavor above ground. In the almost entirely fungal diet common below, however, they’re a confectioner’s staple, prized for sweetness and an almost floral flavor.”

“Crowcherries are small, bitter, and the main ingredient in a liqueur popular with a certain morbid set. The stories that a crowcherry tree will only bloom when fed with blood are almost certainly marketing drivel.”

P.S. If you want to be credited as something other than your forum name, let me know! (DMs or Slack messages are fine for that, but please keep submissions in this thread.)

              <p>A sign that a world had once been colonized by Terrans is the presence of low-growing yellow flowers with saw-toothed leaves. This green plant thrives on nearly any planet with liquid water, gaseous carbon dioxide, and silicate soil. The ubiquity of this species on so many worlds may be due the irrestibility of gently blowing off the “head” of its ripened, wind-borne seeds.</p>

The key difference is that it has a migratory root, and as such the plant itself can slowly but steadily travel as well as climb walls. The name has also been applied to the subject of a series of unsolved stranglings.</p>
