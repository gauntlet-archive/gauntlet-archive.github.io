    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/04/25/crowdfunding-collection-166/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #166, including every tabletop rpg project started between 04/18 and 04/25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Let’s start with &lt;b&gt;Legacy of the Soul Flame&lt;/b&gt;. The game presents an epic fantasy setting, in which the undead won. With a focus on those undead, snow &amp; ice, exploration and bloodties. In a world that unites old technology and magic. The 420 pages strong book is already written, and will ship via DTRPG PoD. The d6 based system has been used in Astulae before and got improved. Plus, the setting can be used in other games. It looks cool and like its sure to deliver, check it out. Then there is the &lt;b&gt;Modern 5E core book&lt;/b&gt;, which offers exactly what the name promises. A contemporary setting and rules within the D&amp;D 5E framework. With illustrationen by Larry Elmore. I am somewhat surprised, it hasn’t funded yet, and will keep an eye on it.
Fans of Space Operas are in for two treats. On the one hand, there is &lt;b&gt;Swords And Spaceships&lt;/b&gt;. Next to the normal array of various, creative races next to humans, the setting includes weapons, body modifications and the option to customize ones ship. The system is d100 based, and spices it up with a FATE inspired mechanics for modifying conditions. On the other hand, there is &lt;b&gt;Tangent Space&lt;/b&gt;. Which does as well offer a great variety of races and setting appropriate elements. The system is based on dice, that scale along the abilities of the character. It does look sympathetic.
If you like game books, check out the project &lt;b&gt;A Warriors Quest&lt;/b&gt;. It kickstarters a number of books, set in the world of Elvyon. They are already exist in French, and the whole project appears worth checking out.
Next there are many other cool projects. Like &lt;b&gt;Sirens: Battle of the Bards&lt;/b&gt;, a D&amp;D 5E setting with and by Satine Phoenix, or the D&amp;D 5E sourcebook &lt;b&gt;Into the Feywild&lt;/b&gt;, which fascinates me as a player who more often than not plays druids. Then there are nice dice projects like the &lt;b&gt;Handmade Resin DND Dice Sets&lt;/b&gt;, the glow in the dark &lt;b&gt;Fluorescent Dice&lt;/b&gt; or the strangely designed &lt;b&gt;NEW VTB DICE&lt;/b&gt;.
You’ll find these, and more cool projects, here:
