    <description>**General sign-up time** : January 6th, 10:30 AM Eastern

*Alice is Missing*  is a silent role-playing game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town of Silent Falls.

​

After character creation, the game is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually. They explore their relationships with each other and Alice while also trying to figure out where Alice may be. The game regularly creates new information and plot events through the use of card reveals that occur at scheduled times.

A seat has been reserved for Sam and Donogh.

**CONTENT &amp; TRIGGER WARNINGS**

*Alice is Missing*  inherently deals with topics of lack of agency, death, grief, helplessness, loss, tense family dynamics, and violence. Player discretion is advised.

**Media Touchstones** : Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, Firewatch, Searching

**Safety Tool:**  X Card, Lines and Veils, Open Door

**Code of Conduct** : This event adheres to the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)

**Technology:**  Roll20, Discord, and Zoom.

**Recording:**  This session will not be recorded.

Game links and more info will be sent via email one week prior to the game.
