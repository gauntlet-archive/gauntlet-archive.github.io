    <description>One spot in this game is saved for a player new to the Gauntlet.

Someone is murdering the great astrologers of Acamar, and the local powers—lycanthropes, daemon-worshippers, snake handlers and faerie supremacists—all blame each other. But who is really killing these prophetic figures, and why? You play a cabal of human sorcerers armed with magic and martial arts, fast cars and firearms, who must get to the bottom of things before an ancient conspiracy can complete its celestially-inspired mission and doom the known worlds.

Nexus by Blake Ryan is a pbta game about modern-day sorcerers and their adventures across the multiverse. No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be explained in play. The game is in development, so there could be some rough edges, but I’m confident we’ll have a good time. My intended tone is pulpy adventure: The Fast and The Furious meets cosmic horror.

Subject matter is likely to include some violence and horror themes, but nothing especially heavy. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

We’ll be playing over Zoom with short breaks on the hour. I’ll ask players if they’re comfortable with recording the session either to post publicly or to share with the designer, but will only record if everyone is happy with that. 

I’ll email players a week before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials. Please sign up for all sessions you wish to attend. 

Open access time for sign ups is 5.30pm 7 March AEDT.
