    <description>My regular group is playing a game of Dogs in the Bark, and the players have collaboratively decided on wanting to run a gang of crime-solving dogs.

The problem is that the core loop of BitD assumes that you&#39;re 1) invested in faction play 2) looking to upend the status quo by expanding your turf and 3) invested in your gang. All of this goes out the window with crime-solvers, and the players and I agree that a lot of the mechanics feel superfluous.

We&#39;re hoping to port these characters over to a rules-lite narrative system. The key criteria are 1) flexible enough to port over these character concepts 2) has a core loop of crimefighting / mystery solving. 

Does anyone have good recommendations? It&#39;s not a long-term game, so the lighter the rules the better.</description>

<p>Thanks for suggesting my game, but I don’t think The Murder of Mr. Crow suits the purpose, because the OP wants to port from one system to another.</p>
<hr>
<p>I would actually suggest <strong>Dogs in the Vineyard</strong> - it creates <a href="https://gnomestew.com/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">fish tanks</a> (mysteries/intrigues), is rule light, have rules for relations (if you know people - get dice), and I can’t think of any character concepts that should be hard to port over to this system.</p>
<p>As long as they are on the good side, I think this is a great system to use, because they are going to be assholes - by using unnecessary violence.</p>
<p>(I honestly thought <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tS2Ulu4JoJVy_eKQ5Iqt2ewWZdEP3Tao/view" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Dogs int the Bark</a> was a DitV hack before I looked it up.)</p>

              <p>Perhaps The Witch is Dead. It aims to be a one-shot with a very particular goal for the PCs: it’s about pet-animals solving a murder and exacting vengeance for it. That can be altered for crime instead of vengeance. It’s incredibly rules-light.</p>

              <p>Well, my first thought of a mystery-solving core loop is generally GUMSHOE, so maybe a slimmed-down GUMSHOE system like <em><a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/bubblegumshoe/" rel="nofollow noopener">Bubblegumshoe</a></em> might be something? Another possibility is <em><a href="http://makebigthings.com/noirlandia/" rel="nofollow noopener">Noirlandia</a></em>, which I would say leans more narrative, but also is interesting in that the mystery kind of happens on the fly during play; it’s a GMless mystery game. But you get to make a corkboard of clues!</p>
<p>All of that would need hacking, though. My big thing is…how important is it that the ruleset allow for the PCs being dogs? <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> Or, more to the point, how much does the game change if the PCs are dogs instead of humans.</p>
<p>That made me think of the possibility of something kinda cartoony like <em><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/298630/Jinkies" rel="nofollow noopener">Jinkies!</a></em> I’m assuming that’s maybe not the right tone, since this all started with a BitD hack, and also I haven’t read the game yet, but I know it at least makes room for mystery-solving talking animals. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=9" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>
