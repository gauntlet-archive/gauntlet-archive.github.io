**The Golgotha.** Even the names conjure images of wonder and great danger: the Paradox Spire, the Grove, the War Hive, the Obsidian Garden, the Glass Labyrinth...

Travel far beyond the bloated Core worlds, past the verdant and colourful pleasure worlds in the Mid Rim, past the worn out Imperial Remnant where sanctioned wars rage endlessly, past even the fringe systems in the Outer Rim where separatists build their power or simply hide, on into Wild Space where civilizations more ancient than humanity have long held sway, that is where the Golgotha lie. 

Ancient relics of long-dead empires, these mausoleums are riddled with countermeasures and deadly remains, not to mention bizarre alien species. Why would you choose to go there? Because Golgotha hold the secrets of unknown alien cultures within their echoing halls - ancient, lost technology that the Overseers, secretive members of the fledgling New Republic, mysteriously covet. Steal enough from the tombs and in exchange the Overseers will boost your body and mind, making you more powerful than one can imagine, more than enough to complete your destiny.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. If you&#39;ve seen The Mandalorian TV show, that&#39;s a good inspiration for what&#39;s happening in the setting.

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).
