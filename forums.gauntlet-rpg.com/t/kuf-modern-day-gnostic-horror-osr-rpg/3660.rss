    <title>Kuf - Modern day Gnostic horror OSR RPG</title>

    <description>So over in the thread on goals for 2019 I wrote that I wanted to publish my new game by Easter. The Swedish release did indeed get done in time.  Translating the book into English took a bit longer than I expected, but now it is done, still 2019. :slight_smile:

Anyway, my new game **Kuf** is a modern day Gnostic horror RPG built on top of Ben Milton&#39;s rules light OSR game Knave. 

I have added a somewhat grittier damage and trauma system, a framework for campaigns, dangerous magic and a reworked experience/advancement mechanics a bit to go better with the setting.

In Kuf you play ordinary people who get a peek of what the world is really like, and get changed by the experience. The thirst for more knowledge drives them down a dark and dangerous path.

I&#39;m still struggling to make a good elevator pitch of the game but in the campaign we just wrapped up the PCs:
- Practiced ritual magic based on the things they learned by hanging out with a senile witch in a care facility.
- Learned to fear *the Firebrigade*.
- Traveled to the *Heaths of Silver* where they slept with a monster to learn its secrets.
- Traveled to the places beyond the heaths.
- Had a panic attack in *the Darkest Wood* which resulted in the PC nurse mowing down the PC linguist with a chainsaw. 
- Managed to rescue a journalist/sorceress who had gotten trapped beyond the barrier that defines our reality.

              <p>I would keep it apart from Lovecraft’s works.  In Kuf the world we live in is actually a pretty nice place, all things considered.  But story wise the characters are on a similar trajectory towards insanity and doom.  Though, they are more likely to seek out monsters, because knowledge is also they way to power, not only insanity.</p>
<p>The Gnostics believe that our world is a prison, and that we ourselves are gods being kept in it.</p>
<p>There’s this old RPG called KULT which also builds upon the same idea. Though it took it in a somewhat different direction, making it into something that looked a bit like Hellrazer.</p>

              <p>This sounds really interesting! I’ve never heard the term “Gnostic horror” before today; a quick Google search makes it sound a little like cosmic horror (or “Lovecraftian”, but that has all sorts of squicky-in-other-ways connotations). Is that a fair comparison?</p>
