    <title>Dialect: A game about language and how it dies (one shot)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/dialect-a-game-about-language-and-how-it-dies-one-shot/6248</link>
    <description>Note: One spot is reserved for a player new to the Gauntlet; please DM me if you’ve played less than three games here and would like to join this one. 

Dialect is a GM-less game about an isolated community, their language, and what it means for that language to be lost. In this game, we’ll tell the story of that community by building their language. New words will come from the fundamental aspects of the community: who they are, what they believe in, and how they respond to a changing world.

Dialect comes with a range of ‘backdrops’ or settings: a space colony, a thieves guild, a bunch of kids’ toys that come alive when the child leaves the room, etc. My intention is to decide collectively what backdrop we’d like to use at the start of the session along with a more general tone conversation. We’ll also use Lines and Veils, the X Card, and the Open Door Policy. The game will take place under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct - https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html. 

The game will run on StreamYard with breaks on the hour starting 2pm 27/12/20 AEDT, and will be recorded if all players consent. We’ll use Google Slides (or similar; tbc) for shared play materials. No rules knowledge is expected and I&#39;ll teach the game during play. 

Open access time will be 8:00am on 21/12/20 AEDT.
