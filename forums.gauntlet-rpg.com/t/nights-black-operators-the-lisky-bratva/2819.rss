    <title>Night&#39;s Black Operators: The Lisky Bratva</title>

    <description>5 sessions at 7.30pm (UK time) on Tuesdays in October, set in the world of **Night&#39;s Black Agents** (by Ken Hite; Pelgrane Press) using the **Operators – Cinematic Action Roleplaying** rules (by @Kyle_simons; SJK Publishing).  The sessions will be scaffolded by **The Zalozhniy Quartet** story arc (by Gareth Ryder-Hanrahan; Pelgrane Press).
Attendance at all 5 sessions is ideal but not required. The sessions are scheduled for 3 hours and will be recorded for posting on YouTube.

You used to serve your country in the shadows, doing things — or stopping things — that couldn’t be shown on the evening news. Then you stopped. Maybe you got tired, or maybe you got burned, or maybe you got out while you could. But you didn’t go legit. You stayed in the shadows, in Europe’s deniable underground networks of crime and conflict. You worked for money in secret accounts, and for people you didn’t know. But they weren’t people. It turned out they couldn’t be shown in daylight or on the evening news either. Because they were vampires.
Now you know. And they know that you know. So you’d better start tracing their operations, penetrating their networks, following their trail, and targeting their weak points ... because if you don’t hunt them, they will hunt you. And they will kill you … or worse …
