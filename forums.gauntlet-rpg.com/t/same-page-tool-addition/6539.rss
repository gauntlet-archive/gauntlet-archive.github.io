    <description>Hello,
The Same page tool by Bankuei is a valuable tool to discuss play before play :
https://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-same-page-tool/

I want to add one question to it : 
Do the GM and players get to say &quot;what&#39;s true&quot; (he falls in love with you ; 1D6 level 3 orcs) or only &quot;what&#39;s perceptible&quot; (&quot;he can&#39;t help looking at you smiling as in a reverie&quot; ; &quot;the players encounter a strange looking creature on the side of the road&quot;) ?

The mechanics always &quot;tell it straight&quot;
The GM always &quot;tells it straight&quot; 
Anybody can &quot;tell it straight&quot; for ease of play
When they are not &quot;telling it straight&quot;, but hinting at the truth, they explicitly signal it
Nobody never &quot;tells it straight&quot;
(multiple answers are possible)

I probably got some wrong, but you get the idea. Can you inform this from your viewpoint ?</description>

              <p>Oh, you take Truth to another level. I meant only low level truth, with the stress on “telling it straight” or “having access only to phenomena”.</p>
<p>I have edited OP to make it clear.<br>
Of course, your point still holds : if something is told straight, it can still hint at something else. And then, who gets to tell what is straighter than straight.<br>
It’s basic Pretend play to play with the borders of fiction and meta. But you still need to state what is an acceptable amount of trickery. Like a yellow card in soccer.</p>

              <p>Brilliant tool. I’d forgotten about it and I’ll be using that again going forward. Wish I could heart twice.</p>
<p>Two comments I think.</p>
<p>Firstly, I wonder if <em>separating it into two questions</em> is important here. Sometimes the players want the GM to be the source of truth, and sometimes it’s important that players can establish their own truth. Something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much does the GM decide what’s true in the narrative presented?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much do the other players decide what’s true in the narrative presented?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, if you retain the first question only, I would suggest adding in the idea that sometimes the players get to establish what’s true, which can arise mechanically (e.g. Move outcomes in PbtA) or in the fiction (what a player says about their character is true, for example).</p>
