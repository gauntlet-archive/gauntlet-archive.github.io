*****This game is in open beta testing. Please sign up for this game if you are willing to provide feedback to help the game designers improve the game. A link to a google form will be provided after the game.***** I will email everyone on the RSVP list to confirm attendance. In case someone needs to drop, I will reach out to folks on the wait list!

***Ma Nishtana: Why is this Night Different?*** is a story game modeled on a Passover Seder, a ritual meal and collaborative re-telling of the Jewish Exodus from Egypt. There are opportunities to eat all of the ritual foods or perform more abstract (and remote play-friendly) rituals. You will be asked to prepare some simple items for the game ahead of time.

Together, players breathe new life into the Exodus story by embodying their own version of a key character and roleplaying a series of structured scenes called “Rituals”, culminating in the deliverance of the Hebrew people from peril. Players take turns guiding these scenes, perform *ritual actions* , and collaborate in building a shared world filled with wonder, terror, and deep care. 

We explore the emotional ties of the characters and through their eyes discover what Passover has to teach us: the weight of sacrifice, the strength of community, and the responsibility we have to those who seek a place called home.

**CW: oppression, tragedy, and other themes from the original Exodus may appear.** *This game distorts the Exodus story. It also reorganizes and excludes certain conventional components of the Seder. This may be challenging for some.*

**System** : **Ma Nishtana:** [ **Why is this Night Different?** ](https://kyotoben.itch.io/ma-nishtana) **, open beta version.** No preparation is required, I will be teaching the rules and rituals as we play.

**Duration**  : Two sessions, each one will be 2.5 hours.

**Breaks**  : 1-2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : Yes, but only if all players consent to recording and publishing

**Attendance**  : Because there are only two sessions, being able to attend both would be ideal.

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, an open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

**Open access** : Public signs up are available at 02/11/2021 10PM (Manila Time)
