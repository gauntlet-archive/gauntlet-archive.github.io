Trophy Gold One-Shot

*The word in Fort Noril is that Old Marble Eye, the witch who lives out on Pickbone Mound, is calling for hearty and hale adventurers to do some work for her. She promises a simple task and the opportunity for ancient treasure.*

We will run the OSR module  *The Bruja, the Beast, and the Barrow*  written by Gus L and converted for Trophy Gold. This is a short mini-dungeon and a good introduction for folks new to Trophy Gold.

**Duration**  : 4 Hours

**Breaks**  : 5-10 minutes approximately on the hour

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).</description>
