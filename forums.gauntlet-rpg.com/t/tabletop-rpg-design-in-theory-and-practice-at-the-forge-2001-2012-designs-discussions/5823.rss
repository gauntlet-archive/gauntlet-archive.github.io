    <description>My academic book about the Forge, *[Tabletop RPG Design in Theory and Practice at the Forge, 2001-2012: Designs and Discussions](https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030528188)* is available from Palgrave Macmillan. It combines a historical account of the forums with a recapitulation of the &quot;Big Model&quot; and some examination of the communication dynamics in the threads. It&#39;s written to be accessible to a non-scholarly (read: gamer) audience, and the concluding chapter is presented as an RPG about being a participant in the &quot;indie scene&quot; of the 00s.

              <p>I’m three chapters in and really enjoying it. I was never part of the Forge, only heard about it in retrospect. I was gaming but not online or anything. Very cool to see the lines of development presented in this well written book.</p>
