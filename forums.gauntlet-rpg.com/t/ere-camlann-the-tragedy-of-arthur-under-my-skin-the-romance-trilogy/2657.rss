In September, we will be wrapping up Emily Care Boss’s  *Romance Trilogy* . These three games revolutionized rpgs by focusing on issues of intimacy and romance. Ben Lehman wrote, “They are among the first and most successful forays into human relationships as the focus of play.”

These two sessions are devoted to  *Under My Skin*  (2008). Players will take on the roles of “a group of friends and acquaintances whose lives are changed by new love and attraction.” Themes of desire, commitment, temptation, and betrayal are front and center. 

In our case, we will be playing a hack called  *Ere Camlann*  which involves the tragic events of the court of King Arthur. This variant veers heavily into American freeform and LARP-style play, and players will choose between the characters of Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and Morgaen. 

Each session will be three hours. Attendance at both sessions is encouraged, but not required.  You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Rules will be taught. Sessions will be recorded. 

We will have a pregame discussion of lines and veils as well as employ the X-card during sessions. We will observe the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy. 

[Session 1](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Lk57ArSVhrcNDqjrGgs): [date=2019-09-02 time=20:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-09-02 time=23:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]]
