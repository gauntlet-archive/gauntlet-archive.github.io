    <title>The Pack - Pets in the Post-Apocalypse (play test)</title>

    <description>Amos had been dreaming. In his dream, he was at the park, the big one they had to drive to. And he was chasing a squirrel. He could hear his human calling after him, but he just needed one more minute… The squirrel sped over the top of the hill. He followed, and upon coming over the rise, he saw the squirrel was gone. Not gone. Changed. A terrifying visage, enormous, with glowing eyes and rows of sharp teeth. The monster squirrel turned to Amos and bellowed, it’s breath a searing flame down the dog’s back.

Amos awoke with a start, heart pounding. Something was off, and not just the dream. The dim light of the early dawn poured into the bedroom, but it was the scent he noticed first… Well, the absence of his humans’ scent. They weren’t in their bed.

Amos ran downstairs, and nosed his way out the door. Other dogs and cats were out in front of their houses, as well, and they all looked just as puzzled. Or maybe that was fear.

And then a noise shattered the morning quiet, a shriek both metallic and organic. A machine trundled along their street, one that looked nothing like anything they’d ever seen before. As it passed, Amos trembled. The machine shrieked again, sounding just like the monster from his dream.

*The Pack is a Belonging Outside Belonging game about pets in the post-apocalypse. The players play as dogs who have gotten together after discovering all the humans are gone.*

*This is a ***play test*** of a game currently in development. To paraphrase Jammi: the game might not work as expected, but I will try to make sure everyone has fun.*

*The main touchstone for this is the comic [Beasts of Burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beasts_of_Burden) (Evan Dorkin and Jill Thompson).*
