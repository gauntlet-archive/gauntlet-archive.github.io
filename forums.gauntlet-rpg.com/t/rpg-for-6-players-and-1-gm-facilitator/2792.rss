    <description>1 GM and 6 players. Yes, this is what happens when friends from all over the country come to visit you on the same weekend... Now, we&#39;re looking for a game that can be played as a one shot (~4-5 hours) with seven friends around the table. Suggestions anyone?</description>

              <p>Probably too late to help <a class="mention" href="/u/eike">@Eike</a> but recently I ran a one-shot of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Knave</em></a> for a large (&gt;= 6) group of folks new to RPGs and it went really well. I pointed them at a <a href="http://plastic-idolatry.com/erik/knave/" rel="nofollow noopener">character generator</a> I whipped together and we were off to the races.</p>
<p>I credit the simplicity of the system (rules can be summarized on a couple pages) as well as the fact that random character generation meant we could jump right into the action. I also went around the table doing an exercise to create “bonds” between characters to help figure out who were friends/enemies/etc. which helped gel the scenario fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Do you want a game that creates equality in your friend group?</p>

<p>Then you’re in luck: Jay Treat wrote a LARP called Strange Gravity, available at Drive Thru and wherever esoteric RPGs are sold: <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/202647/Strange-Gravity-BUNDLE" rel="nofollow noopener">www.drivethrurpg.com/product/202647/Strange-Gravity-BUNDLE</a></p>
<p>In Strange Gravity, everybody gets a role, which defines both their characters role on the ship and the narrative authority that player has.</p>
<p>So, for ex: The XO (Riker!) also sets the scene – where it is, whose there.<br>
The Counselor (Troi!) also says what relationships people have - whose in love, whose related, who just wants to bang.<br>
The Pilot (Wesley? It’s not clear to me right now) also moves along the plot - keeps things moving and fast paced.</p>
<p>Neat, right?</p>

              <p>+1 for <em>The Warren</em> being a solid choice here (I’m less familiar with most of the other games mentioned). I think the main challenge with GM + 6 PCs is making sure everyone gets time in the spotlight, and to that end you’d maybe want to run a pretty deadly version of the game so people can have cool death sequences and then make space for others (and then come back as new rabbits or take over NPC rabbits as the mood strikes you).</p>
<p>Similarly, +1 for <em>Dread</em> if you can find a scenario for it you’re excited about.</p>
<p><em>For The Queen</em> is also a great choice. I just played a bunch of games of it with 6 at GenCon, and I heard from others that it holds together just fine at 7. It’s a little quicker (maybe you can play it twice, or pair it with a short larp!). If you go with it, I’d also put the “the queen is under attack” card pretty near the bottom of the deck to make sure everyone gets enough cards to really flesh out their character since the game end is tied to total cards and not cards answered / player.</p>
<p>If you could be convinced to check out a larp, I’d highly recommend it. I’ve had really good experiences dipping my toes into larp the past year, especially with larger numbers. I’ve found larps allow you to separate into groups during gameplay in a way that tabletop games don’t really support. <em>Sign</em> and <em>We Are Roommates Now</em> are both great larps that’d work very well with 7.</p>

              <p>My go-to would be my game The Daughters of Verona. It’s a Montsegur 1244 hack where you play comedies. It says on the box that it is for 4 to 6 players, but I’ve played it in groups as large as ten without any problems whatsoever. You can find it on Lulu and DriveThruRPG.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Witch Quest - a game where you play fourteen year old witches and their cats is fine with 6 players plus GM.  The players split into pairs where one plays the witch and one her cat. By game design magic that effectively halves the group size for most purposes. Fun game. You can find the English translation as a free download, ask Google.</p>
<p>Playing basic D&amp;D or one of the more light weight OSR clones would work fine with a party of six plus DM.</p>

              <p>Thank you all for your good recommendations! <em>Final Girl</em> is indeed a very good game for larger groups! Why haven’t I thought of this earlier?! Thanks, <a class="mention" href="/u/curubethion">@Curubethion</a>!<br>
I’m not sure, if the group is really into <em>V5</em>. Although I guess what you’re suggesting, <a class="mention" href="/u/teylen">@Teylen</a>, could easily be applied to other “more traditional” games like <em>The Dark Eye</em> and <em>DnD</em>.<br>
LARP is something I haven’t considered, yet. So, thanks a lot for bringing this up, <a class="mention" href="/u/jmstar">@Jmstar</a>! Also, <em>The Warren</em> has been sitting on my list for quite some time!  So has <em>Montsegur 1244</em>, of which I recently purchased the German translation.<br>
I’d be very interested in that seventh character for <em>Witch</em>, <a class="mention" href="/u/aviatrixcat">@AviatrixCat</a>! And adding Count Carlowe to a game of <em>Lady Blackbird</em> sounds like a fascinating idea!<br>
Thank you all so much: This is a great place!</p>

<p>I once ran a session of Lady Blackbird with a thrown-together 6th player character; for that run, it was Count Carlowe, who probably is the best candidate among the listed characters.

<p>Perhaps <a class="mention" href="/u/jmstar">@Jmstar</a> is too modest to mention it, but a six PC table of Night Witches means all the roles in the section will be filled by PCs <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>If it does have to be tabletop, that sounds like a good excuse for some light-hearted nostalgia-fueled dungeon crawling. Break out your <em>Moldvay Basic D&amp;D</em> and roll up some fighters, elves and wizards.</p>
<p>To me, six is the practical upper bound of any PBTA game, but how satisfying it will be with six players is sort of up to your group dynamics. <em>The Warren</em> feels like a good choice in this space - people can drift in and out, rabbits come and go.</p>
<p><em>Montsegur 1244</em> is a wonderful one shot but only scales as written to six with no GM. You could have two players share a pair of protagonists and it would work fine.</p>
