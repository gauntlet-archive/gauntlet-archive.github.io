This session is scheduled for three hours. It will be recorded and posted with players&#39; permission.

We will be playing Ross Rifles by Daniel Kwan. We will be joined by special guest Maria.

Ross Rifles is a Powered by the Apocalypse game about new recruits of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) stationed on the Western Front in World War I. Sent overseas to fight for crown and country, your characters will make personal sacrifices in the name of Canada, and experience the horrors of industrialized war. No prior knowledge of the system is required.

The X card, lines and veils, and the open door policy will be in effect. This event abides by the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.</description>
