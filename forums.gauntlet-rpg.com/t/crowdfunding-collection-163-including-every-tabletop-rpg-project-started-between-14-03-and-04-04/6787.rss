    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/04/04/crowdfunding-collection-163/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #163, including every tabletop rpg project started between 14/03 and 04/04&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Following a brief hiatus, thanks to a broken ellbow, the collection is back with about 119 projects. Thus, let’s get to ‚em.

The first in the list is &lt;b&gt;Solemn Vale&lt;/b&gt;. A folk horror game by Mark Kelly, inspired by works like Witchfinder General, Blood on Satan’s Claw and The Wicker man. The system features attribute based dice pools and includes a betting mechanic to facilitate the narrative. You’ll find that Justin Achilli is listed as one of the authors, and thus, over all, I am very tempted to back it. If you are looking for Indiana Jones style adventures in the Trinityverse, you have to check out &lt;b&gt;Trinity Continuum: Adventure!&lt;/b&gt;, the newest edition by Onyx Path Publishing, that does utilize theor Storypath System. Fans of superheroes should have a look at &lt;b&gt;Pandora: Total Destruction&lt;/b&gt;. A game that does spice it up by adding a dose of Akira. You might checkout the system with the preview version of the game at DTRPG, and it is described as being narrative first. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Tales of Teralecia&lt;/b&gt;, a D&amp;D based game, with a Steampunk / SciFantasy setting. It offers some videos (and a QR code?) for further insight. Tho it ain’t my cup of tea.
Fans of Science Fiction, especially the gritty kind, should check out &lt;b&gt;Death in Space&lt;/b&gt;. The rules light systrem is OSR inspired and the characters will explore the gritty vastness of space. The presentation seems solid, As does the site of the &lt;b&gt;Dark Energy RPG&lt;/b&gt;. The world is based on the novels by the same name, and the SciFantasy mix invokes Shadowrun to my mind’s eye theatre. The system allows to focuses on heroes and villains, which sounds interesting. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Rising Shadows&lt;/b&gt;, which likewise aspires up to be cyberpunk. Though the text based description couldn’t keep ne interested. At least the thumbnail looks nice.
If you are a fan of fantasy, I’d recommend having a look at &lt;b&gt;Goblin Country&lt;/b&gt;. The zine sized, gm-less game imagines you to be adventures goblins, who don’t appear as fooling as in other games but rather cute. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Ageless Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;, which features an online platform to facilitare the game. With the special feature being that you’ll be drawing the map as you play. Fascinating. &lt;b&gt;Spears &amp; Spells&lt;/b&gt; appears to be a classic, OSR like fantasy rpg, that only uses d6. Though the „flexible funding“ nature of the project does raise my alarm senses. Back at own discretion. The &lt;b&gt;Eldritch RPG&lt;/b&gt; doesn’t have such a thing but appears to be normal. The system is developed to be versatile and epic and it should work for one shots and campaigns. Looks solid. Last but not least there is the &lt;b&gt;War and Aether&lt;/b&gt; RPG. It is inspired by D&amp;D, but features a classless system, that’s based on skills, and offers a brutal, realistic combat.
If you prefer your fantasy anime style, &lt;b&gt;Anime 5E&lt;/b&gt; is a must. Instead of being another D&amp;D 5E clone, it’s BESM (Big Eyes, Small Mouth) in fantasy mode. Which I would check out, were I more interested in fantasy. Another anime inspired game is the &lt;b&gt;LokDown TTRPG&lt;/b&gt;, featuring a SciFantasy facilitated by the Tri-Forge.
In regards of the narrative rpgs, I like to feature &lt;b&gt;Fly Softly&lt;/b&gt;. Inspired by the flight of the Monarchs, the game sees you playing as a human/butterfly hybrid, who journeys from Virigina, US to Mexico. On your travel you’ll be helping humans, ghost, mutants and other creatures. The whole presentation has me under a spell, and I am very likely to back it. If you are looking to back not only one, but six games, with one pledge, &lt;b&gt;Possible Worlds&lt;/b&gt; has you covered. It offers a subscription services, that will run over the course of 6 months, bringing you one zine sized game each time. The games look interesting, and I got it marked to maybe pledge later. The &lt;b&gt;Protocol Squared&lt;/b&gt; game by Jim Pinto is the most recent entry to the gm-less Protocol System family. You’ll be playing as soldiers, who return home, after a devastating fight. While the standard setting is a fantasy one, it might be adapted to portray historic wars. Another game addressing the blight of soldiers is &lt;b&gt;Love &amp; Barbed Wire&lt;/b&gt;. Set during World War I, the game has two players writing letters back and forth. Using a card based system. The whole presentation looks intruiging, despite the heavy topic. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Symposium&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a conversational game about posing philosophical questions, and answering them, according to some rules. It might stretch the definition of roleplaying game, but I feel it warrents being included.
If you like to back a solo game, there’s &lt;b&gt;Rad Zone&lt;/b&gt;. A game in which you try to survive in an apocalypse. The presentation looks very solid and I think it’s worth considering.
In regards to gamebook you might back &lt;b&gt;Legendary Kingdoms – Crown &amp; Tower&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Defenders: Throne of the Bandit Lord&lt;/b&gt;, maybe both. They look good.
Among the many, many other projects I decided to back the &lt;b&gt;Fatum, Dark Myths character creator deck&lt;/b&gt;. The design of the cards is nice, and the presentation how you build your character or draw inspiration, looks easy enough that I may actually use it. Though the playmat thing does help. Thus I recommend you check it out too.
You’ll find these, and many, many more exciting, interesting and worthy projects in the collection:
