All access time for this game is [date=2020-10-07 time=17:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;].

&gt; I can promise you two things: One, I&#39;ll always look this good, and two I&#39;ll never give up on you. -  *Hellboy*

The doors of the end times are opening, one by one. The eleventh door almost wiped out humanity, and now the twelfth is creaking on its hinges. Humanity is desperate, and even the demons and monsters that once filled our nightmares are welcome allies. Time to prove that you are more than a monster; that you deserve this second chance.

Apocalypse Keys is a Powered by the Apocalypse game heavily inspired by media similar to Hellboy and B.P.R.D., where monsters on the fringes of humanity are called upon to stop the impending apocalypse. Players take on the role of members of the DIVISION agency (Department of Interdimensional Vigilance and international Security: Interdisciplinary Operations Network) and need to deal with their own broken humanity, the corporate bureaucracy of the DIVISION, and the impending doom of the universe. All in a day&#39;s work.

This is the first of four sessions. Please feel free to sign up for as many or few sessions as you want, but attending all four sessions is ideal. The game will be played over Zoom and will be recorded/shared online with player permission. One seat is reserved for Dan Brown.
