    <description>Low-Res Futures contains two full roleplaying games, each written by an accomplished designer.

*Handbaskets* is a digitally enhanced, cyberwitch, demon-summoning battle royale game by Maxwell Lander (*Himbos*). Players try to maximize their reputation, take out the competition, and stay alive. But death isn&#39;t the end—those who fall are &quot;resleeved&quot; into strange and entertaining new bodies to continue the entertainment.

*In a Mirror Brightly* is a game of millenarian magical rebellion by Aaron King (*Patchwork World*). Wake up from the drudgery of everyday life in 199X and fight for the best future you can imagine! Inspired by The Invisibles, The Matrix, and Mage: The Awakening, players will fight the power with tech, hex, and sex.

Character creation rules for *In a Mirror Brightly* are avaiable for preview
