In this world, technology continued to grow in leaps and bounds. Neurochips were just the beginning, allowing for every human to bridge the gap between the digital world and physical one. This new hybrid reality gave birth to a wave of technological advancement.
But that’s all in the past.
Now, this shift is systematic. Governments and law enforcement possess tech to decant anyone’s digitized mind into the Neurochips of Slacks — empty bodies devoid of consciousness.
Eventually, and entirely too late, it was discovered that this process had one major flaw: the people decanted from out-of-date Neurochips were all missing some of their memories. You are one of these people.
A Glitch.

These are four of sessions of [The Veil](https://www.samjokopublishing.com/the-veil), using Fraser Simons’s [Cascade](https://www.samjokopublishing.com/the-veil-cascade) supplement. We will be continuing the story of [The Veil: Echoes &amp;amp; Reflections](https://discourse.funtimers.club/t/the-veil-echoes-reflections/1188?u=darren), but now 100 years in the future. Returning characters are encouraged! The session will be streamed on YouTube Live and recorded for Gauntlet Hangouts. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend.

**Safety Tools:** We will use [Script Change](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change) and [Lines and Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913) during our sessions. We will observe the [Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

***Unfortunately I had to cancel these sessions!***</description>
