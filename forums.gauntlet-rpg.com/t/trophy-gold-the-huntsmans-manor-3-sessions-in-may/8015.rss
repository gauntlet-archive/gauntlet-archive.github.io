    <title>Trophy Gold: The Huntsman&#39;s Manor (3 Sessions in May)</title>

    <description>We will run the incursion  *The Huntsman&#39;s Manor*  by Natalie Ash. Attendance at all three sessions encouraged.

If you have played Trophy Gold with me before you are welcome to bring back an existing character or create a new one.

*“Alight! Alight!” The huntsman calls* 

*With sun already set.* 

*The quarry springs as twilight falls,* 

*A trophy now to get.* 

*The moon above shines o’er the hunt* 

*And hot breath fogs the air.* 

*The master surges to the front,* 

*The trophy now is there.* 

*As hot blood runs and soaks the ground* 

*And hunger now’s been paid,* 

*The pack to which you have been bound:* 

*A trophy you’ve been made.* 

*The politically unremarkable Marquess Niral was a hunting prodigy, building his hunting manor on the edges of the forest to hunt the most challenging prey. After his disappearance over a century ago, the manor was abandoned, but what amazing treasures and trophies still remain?* 

*Theme: Pursuit*

While the Marquess Niral was unremarkable in political influence, he was highly regarded in his skills as a hunter. People considered it the height of folly to build his manor as close to the forest as he did, but he would only laugh and say that he built where the prey was. For a few years he held grand hunting meets, taking friend and foe to play at the edge of the dark woods. To many guests, one such hunt was the thrill of a lifetime. It was not enough for Marquess Niral. His own travels into the forest drove him deeper and deeper toward its heart. When his final hunt left the manor ungoverned for a year, the servants turned to other masters and the lodge was left unoccupied. For the last century of its existence, it has lain empty. The manor’s proximity to the forest dissuades most scavengers, and the belief is there remains— beyond the rusted, fallen, heavy iron gates—a treasure ripe for the taking. 

I will send a reminder 1 week before the session.
