This is a game of Hearts of Wulin, by Lowell Francis. It&#39;s been released on DTRPG recently. Hearts of Wulin is a game of Wuxia drama - expects dramatic duels, characters torn between duty and desire, courtly intrigue, poison &amp; betrayal. We will discuss the tone of the game during the first session (this one).

We will have a guest star for some these games.

Being able to attend all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

No experience is needed; everything will be taught in the game.

**Venue** : Zoom

**Contact** : Players will receive an e-mail to check in about a week before the start of the game.

We will discuss Content, Aim, Tone, and Safety Tools in the first sessions. We will use Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door policy, and I will prepare a character keeper as a shared document.

The  **Gauntlet Code of Conduct**  will be in effect for this gam **e**  (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)!
