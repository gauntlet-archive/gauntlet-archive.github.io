              <p>I am thankful to have started a D&amp;D campaign that is NOT running a module. It’s given me the opportunity to create my own stuff for the players. Which has been really fun.<br>
I’d still rather play DW; but I’ll settle for D&amp;D for now.</p>

              <p>I am thankful to have recently discovered Dungeon World. After years of searching for a more meaningful gaming experience, I stumbled upon a off-hand comment about “Fronts” from a game called Dungeon World. Researching this, I have discovered a world that I did not know existed. I feel as if a mole having dug up and come into the sunlight for the first time. It fills my senses and excites my wanderlust!</p>
<p>I am thankful for all the people who pour thier hearts and imaginations to create the vast and wonderful world that is gaming. I can only aspire to reciprocate in some small way by helping to enrich the gaming lives of those around me.</p>

              <p>I guess just being able to schedule an actual tabletop session with my group after an almost two years hiatus and see it come to fruition. We got a new campaign started (I’m running it in Dungeon World for the time being, with plans to switch gears after 3 sessions or so, experimenting with World of Dungeons at first as a transition tool and then, later on, with some OSR system). Aaand, for the first time in the group’s history, our persistent scheduling issues seem to have been solved with the much appreciated aid of play-by-message: we just ended session 2 in this fashion. So yeah, thanks interwebs for the simple online utensils at our disposal, the ones that allow us to introduce and expedite storylines that would otherwise disappear at the bottom of that ominous pit where all our great unused plot twists and story ideas go to die.</p>
