Haunting House on Holly Street is a game by David LaFreniere about searching an abandoned house—16 Holly Street—for clues that might tell you what happened to the family that used to live there. You’ll encounter ghosts during your investigation, and once you enter the house, you cannot leave—you are bound to it in the same way the spectral entities that roam its halls are bound to it. The family that used to live in the house are the Wodworths: father Alvin, mother Marissa, and son Randall. They simply disappeared one day, leaving all their possessions behind. There are many rumors about what happened to the Wodworths, and almost all of them suggest some sort of violence, but no one has ever been able to say for sure.</p>
<p><em>Haunting House on Holly Street</em> is inspired by <em>Murderous Ghosts</em> and similar games, and features gameplay between a Player and a Keeper. The Player is exploring an abandoned house, trying to discover what happened to the family that used to live there. The Keeper is responsible for describing how the house reacts, revealing Clues, and helping with the ultimate theorizing about what took place there.</p>
<p>The game essentially takes the best parts of <em>Brindlewood Bay</em> and distills them down into a two-player game that can be played in less than an hour.</p>
<p>There is no expectation that players have played Carved from Brindlewood games before signing up for this one. It is extremely fast and rules-lite, so newcomers are encouraged to sign up!</p>
<p><strong>System :</strong> Haunting House on Holly Street</p>
<p><strong>Duration :</strong> 1-2 hours (I’m allowing up to 2.5 hours to be safe, but this is a mini-game and I expect it to be quick to play.)</p>
<p><strong>Breaks :</strong> Breaks every 60-90ish minutes (~5-10 minutes)</p>
<p><strong>Venue :</strong> Zoom</p>
<p><strong>Recording :</strong> Fully optional, with permission from all participants before and after the session</p>
<p><strong>Attendance :</strong> This game will be played using the Open Table policy. There is no expectation that the game continue if either of us needs/wants to stop for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>Safety :</strong> Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, Open Door Policy. Tools can be modified throughout the game to suit player needs.</p>
