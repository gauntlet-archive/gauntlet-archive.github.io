___________________________________

This is a run of [The Between](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/360858/The-Between), a game of monster hunters in a gothic Victorian London by [Jason Cordova](https://twitter.com/jasoncordova6) and published by the Gauntlet. This will be a quarterly game, running at the same time on JPN TIME Wednesday Mornings in November and December (EST Tuesday Evenings).

During this run, we will only be using third-party threats drawn from The Between Writing Contest, and an [inter-planetary Mastermind](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I5-KuHYB8vP9rL_G9_3XsYB2Jepf-JFZIMBiwewoIWA/edit?usp=sharing) by Matthew Edwards. üëΩ

This is a game designed for campaign play, though players will be drawn from the waiting list where possible in the event of player absence. For the first 24 hours of sign-ups, I want to explicitly invite players who have not played a game on the Gauntlet or folks who identify as queer to join. üåà

General sign-ups will be available on 10/27 at 9am JP time. We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants. 

We will begin with the Kensington Killer, a threat I love, and at the end of each game we will choose the following week&#39;s threat by a plurality vote. Players are welcome to volunteer ones they are interested in or have written.

The Between is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of mysterious monster hunters in Victorian-era London. These hunters learn about various monstrous threats in the city and conduct investigations, or ‚Äúhunts,‚Äù in order to neutralize them. They gradually become aware of the machinations of a criminal mastermind who is sometimes connected to the threats, but always scheming to bring the Crown to its knees. The hunters will ultimately be forced to reckon with this criminal mastermind in order to save the country.

The Between is directly inspired by the TV show Penny Dreadful, but also takes inspiration from British horror classics, the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, pulp-era media, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  

The Between is Powered by the Apocalypse, meaning its mechanics are inspired, in part, by Vincent and Meguey Baker‚Äôs Apocalypse World. It is also Carved from Brindlewood, meaning the mystery mechanics and procedures are inspired by Brindlewood Bay. This is an emergent mystery game.

**Content Warnings:** This is a game inspired by the TV series Penny Dreadful, and wider gothic horror influences, and as such some very dark themes are inherent to both the threats and the player characters themselves, as well as a focus on sexuality and sensuality. This includes but is not limited to graphic violence, murder, cannibalism, body horror, dark sexual themes (though not sexual violence), threats to children and animals, foul language, blasphemy, witchcraft, and defiling corpses. We will also likely touch on some of the social horror of the Victorian era. We will be using safety tools, but if this does not sound like the sort of material you would like to engage with, this game is probably not for you. 

We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through  email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
