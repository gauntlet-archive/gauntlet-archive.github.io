    <description>Hey folks!

In this post, we will highlight games for the upcoming week which have open seats and therefore the opportunity to add some more gaming fun to your week.

### [ DW Mondays: The Sky Chain 2 ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LcvGBupLfJqb4ZaFsMW)

[date=2019-05-06 time=19:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-05-06 time=22:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
Islands floating in the sky? How strange, is it natural? Is it magical? Why are there giant chains anchoring these floating islands to the ground?  Would they just float away if the chain was broken? Has anyone ever made it to the highest island? The stories say the islands have been up there longer than anyone alive can remember, even the elves, but there are tales that say the islands weren&#39;t always up there. Perhaps those of you who are brave enough should climb up the chain. 

### [ Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland - Tomb of the Serpent Kings ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LawyxIILcxRrpRkuKp4)

[date=2019-05-07 time=19:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-05-07 time=22:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
Have you heard about this whole OSR thing and you’re itching to try it out? Come along and play a bunch of indebted treasure hunters far from their home in the great city of Bastion… They’ve heard rumors of great wealth in a locked away in a desert tomb…

Tomb of the Serpent Kings is an intentionally designed “learning” module. It has been designed to help acclimate new players to the play style of OSR gaming. (I’d recommend taking a look at https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html - especially the last section for players - to get a good feel for what to expect.)

We’ll be using the Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland ruleset - a very lightweight set of rules that are simple to learn. Character creation is quick and easy. (Which is good, since in all likelihood you’re gonna lose one or two on the way.)

### [ Good Society: Among the Stars ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LcOwL42Pp9n-KfZMSNr)

[date=2019-05-10 time=19:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-05-10 time=22:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
In the distant future, humanity has perfect space travel and populated the stars. Among the infinite galaxies lies a peculiar little cluster of civilization. There, in the Habershire System, a cluster of dozens of small space stations, most housing a single family, orbits a beautiful, uncolonized, green and blue planet.

All who live in the Habershire Cluster are part of a social contract called &quot;The Dance&quot;, which is an emulation of Regency Era society with a few changes. We will tell the story of a group of people who devote their lives to upholding their (randomly-assigned) social status, having fun, searching for meaning, and/or looking for love.

This is a reskin of Good Society, which is &quot;a game of balls, estates, sly glances, and turns about the garden—at least on the surface. Underneath this, it is a game about social ambition, family obligation, and breathtaking, heart-stopping longing.&quot;

### [ Dungeon World: Cold Ruins of Lastlife](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-L_hU71aHEgoQqioQ9ZG)

[date=2019-05-12 time=08:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-05-12 time=11:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]  
Imagine grand cathedrals. Spires scraping the heavens. Statues of alabaster and silver. A song echoing through stone corridors. The light of hope ensconced in a thousand torches, keeping the darkest nights at bay. Then imagine it all fell. Grand cathedrals, silent and empty. Spires, crumbling and broken. Statues dirty and tarnished. Song, forgotten and lost. A thousand torches, cold and dark. That is the world of Lastlife. 

### [ Lovecraftesque: House-Sitter](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LaCfdmoENWeydJZm4yc)

[date=2019-05-12 time=11:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-05-12 time=15:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]  
Lovecraftesque is a collaborative storytelling game designed to create brooding cosmic horror in the vein of HP Lovecraft, but free of the weight of the Mythos and its sometimes problematic content.

This session we will play with the House-Sitter scenario by @jasoncordova.  The Witness is Olivia Kirk, a freelance production assistant who has been asked to house-sit by Marvin Tennenbaum, a big-shot movie producer. He lives at the Gardenia House, a mansion in the Hollywood hills, set on 2 acres of beautifully manicured grounds, with pool and private tennis court. Originally built in the 1920s, the house has passed through several owners over the years. Marvin Tennenbaum purchased the property in 2005.</description>
