    <title>Trophy Gold (Four sessions in May)</title>

    <description>*For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you haven&#39;t played in one of my games before (love you all but excited to meet some new faces!)*

A hundred years ago, Toren’s Bend was ruled by the usurper Lord Gahldren. Gahldren was a heretic, and routinely defied the teachings of the Sisters. The people rose up and overthrew him, burning down his keep and murdering his soldiers. A curse fell upon the land, and the town withered away. What treasure remains there? And what remains of the supposed curse?

Trophy Gold is Jesse Ross’s dark fantasy game about desperate treasure hunters risking mind and body against terrible odds. In this series I hope to run a couple of incursions - Hester’s Mill by Jason Cordova and Top Of The World by Jim Crocker - with some hearthfire downtime in between, but will depend how fast the group goes how much material we cover.

No rules knowledge is required, all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter: Trophy Gold includes violence and horror elements, including body horror. Hester’s Mill includes references to cannibalism and human and animal sacrifice. We will use the X Card, Lines and Veils and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

Feel free to sign up for as many or few sessions as you&#39;d like, but please sign up for all the sessions you&#39;d like to play in.

We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. The sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players.

Open access time for sign-ups is 8.30am 28th April AEST.
