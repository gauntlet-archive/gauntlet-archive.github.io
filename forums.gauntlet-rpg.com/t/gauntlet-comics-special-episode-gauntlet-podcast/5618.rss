              <p>Not sure if I’m replying in the right spot, but here goes…</p>
<p>I’m new to the Gauntlet podcast. This special episode was one of the first few episodes I’ve heard of the show. Good stuff!</p>
<p>I’m a part time professional illustrator, and I might be interested in contributing artwork to… something related to the the Gauntlet Comics project, though I’m really unsure what exactly since I’m new to Gauntlet in general.</p>
<p>Obviously, between my Day Job (~60 hrs/wk) and the paying illustration work I have to do, I can’t offer a <em>ton</em> of stuff, but I really like the idea, and would like to put something into it. To contribute.</p>
<p>Since you’re working on a Summer Crossover Event, perhaps a comic book cover? Perhaps a couple of character portraits for the wiki?</p>
<p>I’m not sure, and I’m unsure who best to talk to in order to benefit the most folks, so if someone would be so kind as to point me in a direction?</p>
<p>Oh, and I guess some credentials are in order. Feel free to check out <a href="http://dragonbones.net" rel="nofollow noopener">my site</a> or my <a href="http://patreon.com/mrlich" rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon page</a> for some samples of the sort of work I do.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, and keep up the great work. I really enjoyed it already, just by listening to the ‘overview’ in the podcast. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
