This session is scheduled for 3.5 hours and will be recorded.

Spectaculars is an episodic super-hero game by Scratchpad Publishing. It explicitly supports drop-in play and quick characters. During the course of a Spectaculars campaign, it&#39;s possible to essentially create several series of comics---street level, magical, Fantastic Four-ish, and Cosmic adventures.  In many sessions, new things will be added to the world and decided on by the players.

The world that has currently been build (as of 8/24) has most supers being Veterans who were given powers as part of their deployment.  Hearded into ghettos made specifically for them by the GI Bill and kept track of by microchips embeded deep in their sternum and a need to take the medicine &quot;Ten&quot;, which controls their powers and helps with PTSD, they&#39;ve been thrown aside by the country they served.

We&#39;ll decided if we&#39;re doing Street Level, Magic, or Avengers/Xmen at the start of the month. New characters can be made quickly and we&#39;ll play through the issues as we build the story of the world in the Gauntlet&#39;s version of Spectaculars.

We will be using the X-Card and will be playing in accordance with the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.
