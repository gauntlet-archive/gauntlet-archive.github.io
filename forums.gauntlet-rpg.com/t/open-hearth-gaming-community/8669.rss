    <description>For anyone who&#39;s not on the Slack... Gauntlet Publishing and the former Gauntlet Gaming Community have officially parted ways. The new community is Open Hearth Gaming. My understanding is that the parting was amicable on both sides, but any parting is going to be painful.

Open Hearth Gaming is a direct successor. Please see that site for more details. If you&#39;re on the former Gauntlet Slack, it has been renamed Open Hearth Gaming and your membership should carry over.

              <p>No, we have a Slack used for folks who have played sessions in the community or support the Patreon. We have a Discord, but focused for our events like our free online gaming weekends.</p>
