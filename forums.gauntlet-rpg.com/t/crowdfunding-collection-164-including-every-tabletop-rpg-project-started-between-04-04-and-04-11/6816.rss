    <description>I present to you the &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/04/11/crowdfunding-collection-164/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;new Crowdfunding Collection #164, including every tabletop rpg project started between 04/04 and 04/11&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The collection is back to it’s regular schedule at covering a week. Still there are 11 fresh games being kickstartered. Let’s get to them.

First there is &lt;b&gt;Devil Dice Island&lt;/b&gt;, a small Powered by the Apocalypse game. The protagonists, each with some skeletons in their closet, strand upon a creepy island, where they’ll eventually die. I imagine it’s a bit like Lost, just without being dragged out into oblivion and a rather divisive six season. Next to that I know the designer, consider him a friend, a dp think that the project can be trusted to deliver. Check it out. If you are looking for a game for the whole family, there is &lt;b&gt;Adventure Builder&lt;/b&gt;, which is presented in a quite colorful box. The introducation video highlights an accessible system, the option to have the game be education, and the whole thing looks quite splendid to me.
The game &lt;b&gt;First They Came&lt;/b&gt; is definitely not for kids, yet quite intruiging. The ttrpg is available in English and Italian, and is played blindfolded, with three to five players, and an interactive soundtrack. Storywise it’s set in Berlin about 1942 and the characters appear to be hiding out to not get caught by the regime. While the topic is quite heavy, the presentation looks solid and the mechanic is quite unique. I am not sure if I would play it, but it is for worth having a look and considering it. The card based storytelling &lt;b&gt;Partners&lt;/b&gt; is way more light weight. It puts two players, and just two players, in the role of a classic buddy/cop duo, with one straight and one rash person, and has them solve crimes and other mysteries. Another game that looks quite solid.
&lt;b&gt;We Die Young RPG&lt;/b&gt; is a game about supernatural beings in the (19)90s,…. and had me hooked pretty much with the short text. Even as I realized that my 90s – I am born in 80’s – are to contemporary teens and tweens what the 60s and 70s are to me. Any way, the illustrations are on point, it’s a rare case in which I like the creature mix (zoo approach) and the OSR-inspired system appears fool prove. The whole thing is already written, and I am in. Another OSE influenced is &lt;b&gt;The Bleakness&lt;/b&gt;. A horror ttrpg, in which you’ll be traveling into the snowy, and titularly bleak, Norths. In which you don’t only have to survive, but as well face various unsettling creatures. I gave it a star, for future notice, and recommend it. &lt;b&gt;Rangers of the Midden Vale&lt;/b&gt; is another OSR inspired game, with some storytelling game influences, in which you explore a wilderniss and protect the innocent. It’s less gritty and more fantasy, yet sounds cool to. &lt;b&gt;THETA&lt;/b&gt; is the last of the kinda OSR/OSE inspired games. It offers a quite unique setting, that combines Fantasy &amp; SciFi elements and looks solid.
The Science Fiction rpgs are spearheaded by the new edition of &lt;b&gt;Blue Planet: Recontact&lt;/b&gt;. A hard science fiction game about existing in a waterworld. It appears to be lavishly illustrated, and a 80-pages quickstart offers more details. I consider it worth having a look. If you are looking for a Science Fantasy setting, the &lt;b&gt;Arkelon Chronicles&lt;/b&gt; might have you covered. The setting reminds me of Starfinder, and the system, in which both player and GM each roll a d20 to determine the success of an action, looks interesting. Though the corebook is quite a tome, with it’s 600 pages.
Last but not least, if you are up for a solo game, &lt;b&gt;The Broken Cask&lt;/b&gt; has you running an inn. Housing patrons, sending out adventures and other stuff. It looks neat, and I got it flagged for later consideration. Check it out.
There are of course more projects. Like the Troika sourcebooks &lt;b&gt;A Bug’s Guide th the Shimmer&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Academies of the Arcane&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;The Venture Maidens Campaign Guide&lt;/b&gt; for D&amp;D 5E intruiges me, whereas Mörk Borg fans might like to check out the &lt;b&gt;LORD&lt;/b&gt; adventure.
