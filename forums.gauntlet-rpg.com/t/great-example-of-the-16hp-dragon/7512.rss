    <description>Hi folks, 

Introduced my kid to The Vision of Escaflowne yesterday, and I realized the first episode had a great, great example of the concept of the 16 HP &quot;dragon.&quot; While battling the wyvern. Van even says under his breath at one point something like &quot;the scales are too thick for this sword.&quot; Great clip to show players new to PbtA style games :-)</description>

<p>Introduced my kid to The Vision of Escaflowne yesterday, and I realized the first episode had a great, great example of the concept of the 16 HP “dragon.” While battling the wyvern. Van even says under his breath at one point something like “the scales are too thick for this sword.” Great clip to show players new to PbtA style games <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
