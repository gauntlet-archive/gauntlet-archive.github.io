    <description># Star Trek Adventures Express: Fresh Out of Starfleet Academy
## Are you new to the Gauntlet? This is the session for you!

This game is reserved for people new to the Gauntlet: members who just joined the Gauntlet in 2021, or people who have never played in a regular monthly session.

We&#39;ll focus on having fun, but the GM will also coach players adapting to online play and using tools in Gauntlet games to ensure player safety and comfort.

-------

[ **Star Trek Adventures Express** ](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/star-trek-adventures-express-age-of-ravens) is an adaptation of Star Trek Adventures published by Modiphius. STAE streamlines the rules and mechanics while preserving everything Star Trek.

Players assume the role of officers aboard a starship, in the same timeframe as Picard’s Enterprise. We will determine the exact configuration of the ship and crew in our first session. We will also define the crew’s mission.

--------

## **At-a-Glance**

**System** : Star Trek Adventures Express (Hack of Star Trek Adventures, tuned to improvisational online play)
**The Pitch** : You’re an officer on board a ship in Picard-era Star Trek.
**Schedule** : Four Tuesdays in May x 2.5-hours/session
**Breaks** : Two 10-minute breaks
**Venue** : GM’s Zoom
