    <description>2 sessions of Velvet Glove playtests taking place in July!

Each session will last 3 hours and will be recorded. It is a one-shot playtest, meaning that the rules are not yet complete. It is a playable game however, and I am looking at specific things to playtest, so I may ask you to use a specific playbook, playbook move, or set up a specific scenario. We should still have fun, though!

***Velvet Glove*** is a PbtA tabletop role-playing game where you play a teenage girl in a gang on the streets of 1970’s America. Take exploitation movies like *Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!* and *Switchblade Sisters*, plus a little exploration of coming-of-age movies like *The Outsiders*, add in a gender twist, and you get *Velvet Glove* .

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use. Anyone 21+ is welcome to play, but some topics that may come up include: drugs, teenagers having sex, racism, sexism, and violence.</description>

              <p>This is great to see! I played in your <em>Velvet Glove</em> one-shot at Breakout 2018, and it was one of my favourite games of the con.</p>
<p>Highly recommended. Intense and personal, though, so be prepared.</p>
