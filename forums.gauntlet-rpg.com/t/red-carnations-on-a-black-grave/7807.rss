    <description>*For my 6-year Gauntletversary…*

Red Carnations on a Black Grave is a freeform roleplaying game that brings to life the 72 tumultuous days of the Paris Commune. Each player portrays two characters during the two months of the Commune, one of whom must die during the French Army’s all-out assault on Paris in the last week of May, 1871. Special cards guide your play, providing questions about how the characters are related to each other, historical incidents to serve as the basis of scenes in the game, and the ultimate fate of your surviving characters.
