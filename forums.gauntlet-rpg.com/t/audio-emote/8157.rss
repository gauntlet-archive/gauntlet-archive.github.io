    <description>Hello,
After several online sessions, I realize I really enjoy having a silent channel to emote. It can be video or chat or the emote function of the app. 
But.
Using video or a certain app is not always possible and keeping an eye on the chat is sometimes a brain overload. I&#39;m thinking of an audio code with 3 signals (Y N ?) or a call to chat, chosen in accordance with the setting and tone. The easiest would be a live sound. But maybe you&#39;ll see an accessible and transapplication way of doing that?</description>
