    <title>The keepsake as a design goal</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-keepsake-as-a-design-goal/1333</link>
    <description>I&#39;m in love with the nostalgic feeling that&#39;s invoked by stumbling on old campaign notes. I&#39;ve often attempted to build that into my games deliberately. 

One of my current projects is a game about bards writing an epic about a hero. By the end of the game you&#39;ll have collectively written a poem or song that you can keep forever. 

A backburnered project involves collaboratively building a wiki that describes various aspects of a fiction, using the interlinking component of the wiki platform to connect everything. In the end, you have a library of information related to your fiction. 

Collaborative map drawing games do the same thing. 

What other games have a built-in keepsake?</description>

              <p>I think an obvious answer here is LARPs and the work that goes into creating history, settings, and costumes, often in a very physical, real space. There are a lot of LARPs and LARPers that work to just create the world as part of the game, even if they aren’t involved in ‘wars’ or the larger mystery or story of it.</p>

              <p>So far we have maps, letters (and plethora of other texts), wikis and even rulesets as keepsakes… I am wondering how one would approach incorporating other keepsakes (even things not normally associated with games?) in game design?</p>
<p>I vaguely remember a game that was part of threeforged event where players created a modernist/suprematist artwork. I think it was heavily inspired by early XX century Russian avant-garde  I quite like the idea of creating a piece of art as part of the game. Any other examples of such games?</p>
<p>What about other physical keepsakes? Props maybe?</p>

              <p>To piggyback on <a class="mention" href="/u/charlie">@Charlie</a> mentioning Quill, <a href="https://rpggeek.com/rpg/2029/de-profundis" rel="nofollow noopener">De Profundis</a> produces a series of letters for each player to keep.</p>
<p>Another game that plays with the idea of a keepsake, similar to the above-mentioned Footprints is <a href="https://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/Dictionary-of-Mu.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Dictionary of Mu</a>, where you add more entries to the “dictionary” as you play. After multiple plays the book will have extra notes on pages and extra pages taped inside, etc.</p>
<p>The game I am currently working on takes that Dictionary of Mu idea and runs with it. Players can add new “entries” to the world as well as new rules to the game. My plan is to release a pdf with multiple “empty” pages that you print and write in in as the play progresses. After a campaign you have your very own version of the game.</p>
<p>Also somewhat related - <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/25404/legacy" rel="nofollow noopener">legacy boardgames</a> - recent trend in boardgames that plays with the idea of a keepsake. Games like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105134/risk-legacy" rel="nofollow noopener">Risk Legacy</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1" rel="nofollow noopener">Pandemic Legacy</a> or <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148261/seafall" rel="nofollow noopener">Seafall</a> make you change the game (adding cards to the deck, putting stickers or writing on the board, etc.) as you play a campaign. When you are done you are left with a unique version of the game.</p>

<p>I also like Ash McAllen’s Footprints (<a href="https://acegiak.net/2017/05/11/footprints/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://acegiak.net/2017/05/11/footprints/</a>) which is a game where you edit the gametext as you play, and then it becomes a keepsake to be passed on to the next person playing it as a changed document. It’s a keen idea that I would love to see more of.</p>

              <p>My Lovecraftesque campaign rules (coming soon from the Codex annual Kickstarter) involve generating a campaign journal where you record all your theories about the various horrors you create. If you play for long enough, it will become a sort of custom mythos encyclopedia, filled with detailed notes about all manner of eldritch creatures, as well as wrong scribblings of your early theories that turned out to be wrong. It’s sort of a keepsake, but you can walk into any game of Lovecraftesque and use it, so it never really stops being available as a game resource.</p>

              <p>I love seeing old notes and items. Sorting out my old RPG filing cabinet dredged up a lot of precious documents (and admittedly a lot more which were to be got rid of).</p>
<p>Microscope’s timeline is fantastic to see. I’ve taken photos of my group’s game as it charted the grimdark alternate future my group were trying to avoid in our Masks campaign.</p>
<p>In Monsterhearts I had my players write text messages to each other on post-it notes which were fantastic to read through years later and completely out of context. Fate’s a little similar, in creating this stack of aspects and boosts you can go back to in order to see the ingredients of a fun game.</p>
<p>My first Apocalypse World game used a map and opening scenario we made using The Quiet Year. We modified it through play, but it was a fantastic jumping on point for the campaign.</p>

              <p>I’m in love with the nostalgic feeling that’s invoked by stumbling on old campaign notes. I’ve often attempted to build that into my games deliberately.</p>
<p>One of my current projects is a game about bards writing an epic about a hero. By the end of the game you’ll have collectively written a poem or song that you can keep forever.</p>
<p>A backburnered project involves collaboratively building a wiki that describes various aspects of a fiction, using the interlinking component of the wiki platform to connect everything. In the end, you have a library of information related to your fiction.</p>
<p>Collaborative map drawing games do the same thing.</p>
<p>What other games have a built-in keepsake?</p>
