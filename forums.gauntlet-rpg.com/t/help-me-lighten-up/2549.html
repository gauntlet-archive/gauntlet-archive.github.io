          <p>It has recently come to my attention that my GMing runs‚Ä¶<strong>dark</strong>. I recognize that this is true of myself. I like Abercrombie. I like grim, gritty, and even grimdark (see Abercrombie).</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs not necessarily what my players like and I don‚Äôt want to ring the same bells over and over again either.</p>
<p>I would like my players to describe my games as <strong>dramatic</strong>, or <strong>exciting</strong>, or even just <strong>fun</strong>. Any of those would be better than <strong>dark</strong>.</p>
<p>I know this kind of change is possible - but does anyone have any suggestions for how to go about it? Especially about how to fight existing tendencies and actively practice and learn new ones? I already tore down my entire trad GMing game and rebuilt it around fail-forward and player empowerment about 15 years ago and it was‚Ä¶tough. Exhausting. There were too many sessions that weren‚Äôt enough fun while I was learning.</p>
<p>Anyone have any tips on making this easier? Faster? Or do I just say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone, I‚Äôm trying to reform my grimdark ways, based on your feedback. I‚Äôm going to do my best but my instincts are all to find the worst thing that can happen and then crank that up and shove it in your faces and shout, ‚ÄúOh yeah? What are you going to do about THIS?‚Äù Please understand that I may take longer than normal to decide on the results of actions as I seek to moderate outcomes, and please let me know if something has gone too deep into tragedy and we can retcon it ASAP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks in advance for your advice. From me and my beleaguered MASKS players!</p>

          <p>Maybe start with some NPCs that are actually nice. Not terribly effective, maybe, but really kind-hearted and well-meaning. And then don‚Äôt make them the victims of some gruesome murder or the perpetrators of a heinous betrayal, but just let them be there and be hopeful.</p>

          <p>If you‚Äôre playing <em>Masks</em>, the best advice I can give is <em>watch some cartoons</em>.</p>
<p>Seriously, go check out a run of <em>Teen Titans Go</em> or <em>Young Justice</em>, classic 90s <em>X-Men</em>, even <em>Steven Universe</em>.  They get across the angst and anxiety of being a teenager, contending with learning how to be in love, how to take responsibility, and all that growing-up stuff (that could get pretty grim pretty quick) while still staying upbeat and fun. Allow the PCs some time to do stuff that isn‚Äôt saving the world. Make <em>extra</em> time for that at the beginning. Be very self-conscious about stepping away from the action and letting them develop relationships with people they actually like doing not-superhero things that are fun. <em>Teenager</em> fun.</p>
<p>If you need help with that, ask every player to name one MCC who is ‚Äòimmune to dark‚Äô. That doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt ever be put in danger, or that they‚Äôre not important to the story, just that you‚Äôll pledge not to take that person out of their lives without their permission, and strive to play THAT MCC as hopeful, helpful, optimistic, friendly, etc. like <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/sabinev5">@SabineV5</a> suggested.  A sense that there‚Äôs some stability to at least one of their MCC relationships will go a long way to letting them relax and enjoy the game, which will have the paradoxical but predictable effect of making the <em>rarer</em> moments of darkness way more potent.</p>

          <p>Absolutely communicate with the players! They can help you manage tone very powerfully. Also, I highly recommend using content management tools to help with this (<a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html</a>); <em>Lines &amp; Veils</em> is a good way to pre-emptively manage your content, for example, by setting your own Lines on dark elements you want to keep away from.</p>

          <p>I think you can say that <em>and</em> try to incorporate some tips.</p>
<p>I used to have a darker style. For me, that grimness was driven in part because I thought it was my job to challenge <em>the players</em> as well as the characters. Then I sat down with one and asked them why they weren‚Äôt enjoying themselves. They answered ‚ÄúI think hard all day at work. When I play, I just want to kill some stuff and have a laugh.‚Äù That was illuminating for me. Talking to your players - what a concept.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also found some grimmer games are grim because the GM focuses on trying to realistically portray the setting as opposed to, say, trying to make the setting cinematic. So maybe look to what your inspiring fiction is - are you aiming for a real space game where a pin-prick to the oxygen tank spells doom or Legolas winning his way with ease through everything?</p>
<p>‚ÄúBe a fan of the PCs‚Äù is, I think, the best advice. If you don‚Äôt want to see them come out the other side, maybe go back to char gen and work with the players so that they are more sympathetic?</p>

          <p>I‚Äôll echo <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/curubethion">@Curubethion</a> here: talk to your players. A great way to start that conversation is CATS:</p>
<p><a href="http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://proleary.com/2016/04/25/the-cats-method-a-story-telling-game-opening-ritual/</a></p>
<p>From then on use safety tools like <a href="http://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/" rel="nofollow noopener">Script Change</a> to let everyone (players and MC) pause things to point out when things are going darker than the agreed upon tone.</p>
<p>As someone who runs a periodic series called <em>Tragic Tuesdays</em> I can empathize. But I do so on The Gauntlet, so people decide to play or not. I don‚Äôt have a group where I am <em>the</em> GM. I tend to be someone who likes the extremes so on the other hand I‚Äôll run Gonzo stuff to even things out.</p>

          <p>Ahhh there it is! I wanted to recommend CATS but couldn‚Äôt find a good blog post/website that talked about it. Maybe a good resource to link on The Gauntlet‚Äôs pages?</p>
<p>It can also be helpful to get analytical. You‚Äôve cracked the formula on how to get your players in worse and worse situations, so how would you tackle the problem of how to celebrate the awesomeness of the characters? Honestly, just singling out moments where characters are doing awesome stuff and celebrating that both in the moment and after the fact (see: Stars and Wishes, <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes</a> ) will start to build a feedback loop in your brain. If you‚Äôre excited to see players doing really fun, awesome stuff, that‚Äôll actually help rewire your instincts along the way.</p>

          <p>If something bad just happened, don‚Äôt follow it up with another. Put in a mundane or lighter moment to mix up the tone.</p>
<p>Mundane stuff : visit from an old friend, asking them to share a childhood memory, seeing a theatre/movie with a sibling, a cat/dog/raccoon adopts them, friend of a friend heard about something they did and just wanted to say thanks (they‚Äôre also pretty cute).</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt mention paying bills or serious disease. If there is an injury, the temple/hospital can fix it-don‚Äôt mention payment.</p>
<p>Hobbies help, give them a few successes with it, and build up to them fixing that old car/forging that awesome blade/designing the royal dress. It will change how they see their character and how npcs see them.</p>
<p>Police/City Guard will cut them some slack if they are saving lives/fighting bad guys, you know like how heroes get treated by the cops in every 90 min action film.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt forget things like nights at the club, birthdays, street parties, religious festivals (with non lethal contests like juggling, archery, singing, pottery)</p>

          <p>My advice would be to stop being the boss. Play some GMless, GMful, heavily collaborative games. Ask your friends to step up and run some games that you get to play. Cede your authority and embrace the group vibe while adding your own special darkness now and again.</p>

          <p>So the darkness arises from the complications, not the game‚Äôs genre? That seems like it would be hard to change. I like dark fiction; I get bored with novels where ‚Äúeverything is beautiful and nothing hurt.‚Äù It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt get satisfaction from other texts or that darkness is the only good mode, it‚Äôs just less emotionally impactful. I empathize here.</p>
<p>Maybe use that old DW complication roll table (or make your own) that has more moderate responses to the game. This way it‚Äôs not taking you extra time in-game and has some moderation built in. Or make a simple table with increasing intensity of consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>broken finger &gt; mutated hand &gt; dismembered forearm.</li>
<li>hear a voice in your head &gt; sickening feeling like there‚Äôs something inside you &gt; your actions are no longer your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think ‚ÄúTrophy‚Äù does with ‚ÄúConditions‚Äù growing in intensity as you encounter new rings, you might take a look at that.</p>

          <p>The advice here has been spot on. My advice is pretty similar to what others said (<a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/blakeryan">@BlakeRyan</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/jimlikesgames">@JimLikesGames</a> in particular) but maybe this formulation will also be useful.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to make a list of ideas of scenes, twists, or story lines which you would consider <em>dramatic</em>, <em>exciting</em>, or <em>fun</em> (and in any case not <em>dark</em>). Don‚Äôt railroad people towards these, but just figure out for yourself what they look like and how you might get there from your story using the MC moves.</p>
<p>These can be large story arcs, complications from their alter ego, twists to their relationships (marriage, break up, problems at work, moving, etc.), teaming up with villains to do something non-villainous, visiting a new city, etc. They can also just be small scenes you think would be fun to try, e.g. superheroes at a party or a bar, what it‚Äôs like having to testify in court, being interviewed by the Super Society, etc. The important thing is that they seem interesting to you and that you can get used to seeing their <em>shape</em> and <em>feel</em>.</p>
<p>Going <em>dark</em> in a story is a little bit like eating sugar or a dessert in a meal. Characters often have tragic pasts, or experience loss, but these events are more significant and satisfying when they occur after other character and plot development (the nutritious meal). But once you get used to eating a lot of sweets all the time it‚Äôs hard to appreciate the other flavors and break the habit.</p>
<p>Since you‚Äôve trained yourself to see ways to take stories in a dark direction this will likely be your impulse while running the game. To break the habit, you not only need to reign in this impulse (which it sounds like you‚Äôre doing) but also build a sense of where you <em>do</em> want to go, and practice seeing opportunities to get there.</p>

          <p>It sounds like you‚Äôve become a pro at making your stakes matter by making them dark. (Not  a bad thing - I think a lot of people struggle with that!)</p>
<p>Since your goal is to make things feel lighter, rather than going for the grimmest stakes available, instead look for stakes that matter to the PCs <em>personally</em> but aren‚Äôt going to cause death, dismemberment, or insanity. That way you have investment and tension (which often is what amounts to ‚Äúfun‚Äù) without the consequences having to be ‚ÄúAnd also your beloved companion is brutally removed from existence in front of you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Good news is, in Masks, this is especially easy since you‚Äôre playing teenagers who care about ALL SORTS OF THINGS that might not lead to grim ends. Prom night? Likes on Instagram? Attaining your dreams of getting accepted into your ideal college RIGHT NOW? That new pair of shoes or iPhone upgrade? All things that can cause the character to care, to chase things, and don‚Äôt have to go dark if they lose them or if you want to ramp things up a bit.</p>
<p>Look for character-invested stakes that <em>feel</em> like they life-or-death matter without <em>actually</em> life-or-death mattering.</p>

<p>I really like this idea. Vary the dynamic. I think I‚Äôm gonna make myself a card that‚Äôs black on one side and flip that side up when something has gone dark. It‚Äôll remind me to produce a different kind of tension.</p>

          <p>Have you ever heard of Swords Without Master or Monkeydome?</p>
<p>Those games introduce ‚Äútone‚Äù as a variable, and some technique for switching it over.</p>
<p>You could make a ‚Äútone‚Äù tool for yourself, and engage it at certain times. For example, a card which says ‚ÄúGrim‚Äù on one side, and ‚ÄúFull of Hope‚Äù on the other. The rule is that you can‚Äôt flip over the card until you create or narrate something that fills that quality, and you can‚Äôt go against the quality while it‚Äôs face up, either. See if that kind of thing makes a change to your GMing; everything is worth a try!</p>

<p>I‚Äôve got Swords Without Master haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to really read it yet. But it sounds like the kind of concrete tool I can apply at the table that will remind me and allow my players to help correct course if I go against the card, because they‚Äôll know the state of the tone card.</p>

          <p>Very nice! I don‚Äôt think reading that game will give you much more in terms of tone; the only difference is that in the game, the tone switches based on a die roll.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs definitely worth finding some cues for yourself like these, whether it‚Äôs for prep or for play. You could also have a checklist of more specific things, like, ‚ÄúA kind and well-meaning soul‚Äù, which you check off when you include them in your prep or in a scene. ‚ÄúSomeone develops a crush without ulterior motives,‚Äù stuff like that. It depends a fair deal on the specifics of your game and the particulars of how you tend to ‚Äúget dark‚Äù.</p>
<p>Can you think of any instances of your game where you <em>tried</em> to make things less grim, but you feel the attempt didn‚Äôt work (either because you couldn‚Äôt follow through, or because you didn‚Äôt do it the way you had wished)?</p>
