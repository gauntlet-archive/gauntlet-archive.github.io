    <description>Feathers is a game of angels, fallen into our world, wandering in unfamiliar, fragile bodies, looking for a people, places, and selves they can fnd comfort in. It’s about being divine inside, and learning to own and love what’s on the outside. It’s about the connections that keep us warm, and how we become the people we want to be. Heaven is lost to them, never to return, but there are undreamed of joys and tragedies to be found among the flock here below.

In case it isn’t clear: this game is deeply queer, and is a pretty transparent metaphor for being transgender. You’re not here to wallow in misery, even though the characters are likely to hurt and get hurt along the way. This story, just like ours, is ultimately an optimistic one.
