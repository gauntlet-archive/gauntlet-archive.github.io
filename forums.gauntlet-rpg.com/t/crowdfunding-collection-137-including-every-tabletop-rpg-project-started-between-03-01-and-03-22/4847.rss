    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/03/23/crowdfunding-collection-137/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #137, including every tabletop rpg project started between 03/01 and 03/22&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks to COVID-19 and other hassles I had to delay the crowdfunding collection. Which in consequence means you got plenty of projects to enjoy while your practicing social distancing. Sadly, some projects finished before I got this collection done. Seeing that they are more than usual, I decided to give them a brief post-closure shoutout.

Though, let’s get to the projects. First and foremost I wouldlike to highlight &lt;b&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/b&gt;. It’s a vampire game that uses the Ironsworn system. Thus enabling to design the vampire setting and mythos to your liking. The game can be played with a group and a GM, without a GM and even solo. I am enticed with the idea, the concept and the presentation and do highly recommend it. Check it out, it does still need quite some funding. A game that doesn’t need to really wrestle for funding is the 2nd edition of &lt;b&gt;World Wide Wrestling&lt;/b&gt;. The cool wrestling rpg, get a well deserved polish and new edition, still with a powered by the apocalypse system and slam dunking the system. Before my sports metaphors get more off track, let’s take a look at &lt;b&gt;Magonomia&lt;/b&gt;. The game offers a fantasy renaissance setting with an interesting take on magic and spiritism. If you like Fate, take a look. I think it deserves it. If you rather prefer a more traditional fantasy game, check out the third edition of &lt;b&gt;Savage Kingdoms&lt;/b&gt;. It appears quite competent. As does the superhero game &lt;b&gt;Ascendant&lt;/b&gt;. I didn’t get to much into the details, but the system seems well laid out and quite a lot of backers love it. &lt;b&gt;Agnomely&lt;/b&gt; is a smaller game. On the one hand you’ll be playing gnomes which are small creatures. On the other hand, it comes as a zine. Take a look at that cutey. If you rather have one system and decide the genre for your self, why not take a glance at &lt;b&gt;Dice &amp; Capital&lt;/b&gt;?
I personally like the Mecha and Science Fiction genre and &lt;b&gt;Beam Saber &lt;/b&gt;has you covered with both. Seeing your mechas head out to kick ass and do missions. It comes with a Forged in the Dark system and I am tempted. Maybe you prefer cyberpunk instead?Then you should take a look at the PbtA like game &lt;b&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/b&gt; – well and Cyborgs are kinda fleshy mechas ^^;
Sometimes, in the time of social distancing, you might like to play a good ol‘ solo ttrpg. In which case there’s &lt;b&gt;Monsters! Monsters&lt;/b&gt;. That’s if you like a traditional fantasy setting and would like to have an adventure inclided. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Foolscap Octavo RPG Zines&lt;/b&gt;, in which you’ll get the solo game Phantasticine, a game that might help you sleep (unironically), the supplement Substratum about exploring mindscapes, and and &lt;b&gt;Laser Beams Like So Many Stars&lt;/b&gt; in which you can cheer for mecha (pilots). Last but not least there is the &lt;b&gt;2021 Quest Calendar: A Year of Adventure&lt;/b&gt; where you’ll get an adevnture each day, to explore. Very cool.
There are of course many other interesting projects. Like the impressively illustrated &lt;b&gt;Izirion’s Enchiridion of the West Marches&lt;/b&gt; campaign, the &lt;b&gt;Legendlore&lt;/b&gt; setting by Onyx Path for D&amp;D 5E, the &lt;b&gt;Multiverse&lt;/b&gt; online platform or the &lt;b&gt;Keyfish Crit&lt;/b&gt; dice that got lil‘ fishies inside or the &lt;b&gt;Dice Soap &amp; Token Snowglobe Dice&lt;/b&gt; that have lil‘ skulls (and other things) inside. I couldn’t resist those.
Of course I couldn’t resist &lt;b&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade – Vendetta&lt;/b&gt; either. It’s a fast, competitive card game placed in the V:tM setting with tons of cool goodies. Check it out!
