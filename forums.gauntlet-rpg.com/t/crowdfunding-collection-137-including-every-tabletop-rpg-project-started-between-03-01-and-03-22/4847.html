          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/03/23/crowdfunding-collection-137/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #137, including every tabletop rpg project started between 03/01 and 03/22</b></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to COVID-19 and other hassles I had to delay the crowdfunding collection. Which in consequence means you got plenty of projects to enjoy while your practicing social distancing. Sadly, some projects finished before I got this collection done. Seeing that they are more than usual, I decided to give them a brief post-closure shoutout.</p>
<p>Though, let’s get to the projects. First and foremost I wouldlike to highlight <b>Bloodsworn</b>. It’s a vampire game that uses the Ironsworn system. Thus enabling to design the vampire setting and mythos to your liking. The game can be played with a group and a GM, without a GM and even solo. I am enticed with the idea, the concept and the presentation and do highly recommend it. Check it out, it does still need quite some funding. A game that doesn’t need to really wrestle for funding is the 2nd edition of <b>World Wide Wrestling</b>. The cool wrestling rpg, get a well deserved polish and new edition, still with a powered by the apocalypse system and slam dunking the system. Before my sports metaphors get more off track, let’s take a look at <b>Magonomia</b>. The game offers a fantasy renaissance setting with an interesting take on magic and spiritism. If you like Fate, take a look. I think it deserves it. If you rather prefer a more traditional fantasy game, check out the third edition of <b>Savage Kingdoms</b>. It appears quite competent. As does the superhero game <b>Ascendant</b>. I didn’t get to much into the details, but the system seems well laid out and quite a lot of backers love it. <b>Agnomely</b> is a smaller game. On the one hand you’ll be playing gnomes which are small creatures. On the other hand, it comes as a zine. Take a look at that cutey. If you rather have one system and decide the genre for your self, why not take a glance at <b>Dice &amp; Capital</b>?<br>
I personally like the Mecha and Science Fiction genre and <b>Beam Saber </b>has you covered with both. Seeing your mechas head out to kick ass and do missions. It comes with a Forged in the Dark system and I am tempted. Maybe you prefer cyberpunk instead?Then you should take a look at the PbtA like game <b>Ascendancy</b> – well and Cyborgs are kinda fleshy mechas ^^;<br>
Sometimes, in the time of social distancing, you might like to play a good ol‘ solo ttrpg. In which case there’s <b>Monsters! Monsters</b>. That’s if you like a traditional fantasy setting and would like to have an adventure inclided. Then there’s <b>Foolscap Octavo RPG Zines</b>, in which you’ll get the solo game Phantasticine, a game that might help you sleep (unironically), the supplement Substratum about exploring mindscapes, and and <b>Laser Beams Like So Many Stars</b> in which you can cheer for mecha (pilots). Last but not least there is the <b>2021 Quest Calendar: A Year of Adventure</b> where you’ll get an adevnture each day, to explore. Very cool.<br>
There are of course many other interesting projects. Like the impressively illustrated <b>Izirion’s Enchiridion of the West Marches</b> campaign, the <b>Legendlore</b> setting by Onyx Path for D&amp;D 5E, the <b>Multiverse</b> online platform or the <b>Keyfish Crit</b> dice that got lil‘ fishies inside or the <b>Dice Soap &amp; Token Snowglobe Dice</b> that have lil‘ skulls (and other things) inside. I couldn’t resist those.<br>
Of course I couldn’t resist <b>Vampire: The Masquerade – Vendetta</b> either. It’s a fast, competitive card game placed in the V:tM setting with tons of cool goodies. Check it out!<br>
You’ll find those, and many more cool projects, here:</p>
