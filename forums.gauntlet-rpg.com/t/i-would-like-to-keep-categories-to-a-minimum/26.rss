    <title>I would like to keep categories to a minimum</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/i-would-like-to-keep-categories-to-a-minimum/26</link>
    <description>I want to keep discussion focused. If we see lots of discussion around something regularly and it looks like it would make a good category then we can look into that. But atm I think less is more.

I specifically also want to nudge people to thread all the discussion about posted Hangouts games.</description>

              <p>You make subcategories the same way you make categories, you can just organize them under other ones. Right now the only thing I might suggest for subcategories would be splitting up stuff in the Content category (ie Codex, Podcast, etc.)</p>
<p>I figure after a few months we can review tags and see if heavy usage of any in particular nudges us to new (sub) categories.</p>
