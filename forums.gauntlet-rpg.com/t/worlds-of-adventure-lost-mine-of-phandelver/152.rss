    <description>Four sessions, the first scheduled for four hours and the rest for three. The session will be streamed on Hangouts on Air and recorded for Gauntlet Hangouts. The is the first session of a playtest for Worlds of Adventure v.03 using the D&amp;amp;D5e adventure Lost Mine of Phandelver. We&#39;ll be using the Forgotten Realms setting, but no knowledge of the setting is necessary. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge, where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path. 
For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines. 
Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the Black Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is. 

We will use the X-card and Script Change during our sessions. We will observe the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
