    <description>*To kick off Star Wars Saturdays in my new home, I&#39;m hacking Storm Riders by Michael G. Barford to work for Star Wars! It&#39;s two different one-shots, so you can sign up for just one, or both.*

Star Riders is a Star Warsy hack of Michael Barford&#39;s wonderful Storm Riders game which appeared in Codex Joy 2.

Star Riders is a game about action hero Star Wars cartoons of the 1980s and the people who love them. Gameplay alternates between portraying characters from a gonzo science fantasy setting, portraying a person in the real-world who loves the show those characters exist in, and even participating in meta-narratives such as TV commercials airing during the show and meetings with the Broadcast Standards board.

-------------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

We will be using the X-Card as well as Roses and Thorns after each session.

This game session will be recorded. This session is scheduled for 3 hours.
