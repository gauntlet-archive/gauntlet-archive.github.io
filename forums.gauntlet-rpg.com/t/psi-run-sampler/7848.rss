    <description>**Greetings, friends, to the Psi*Run Sampler!**

I am going to facilitate three one-shots based on Psi*Run published by Meguey Baker at Night Sky Games, http://nightskygames.com/welcome/game/PsiRun: Psi*Run (Feb. 18), NetWhere (Feb. 19), and NightMirror (Feb. 20).

* **1, 2, or 3:** You are welcome to participate in one, two, or all three of these games as space allows.  You are NOT required to attend all three as each will be its own game.
* **3 hrs with Recording:** Each event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree. Most likely I&#39;ll be using StreamYard.
* **Holding Spots:** I will hold two spots for players who have already expressed an interest as well as two additional spots for players who are New to the Gauntlet. Please let me know by emailing me, aquavertigopublishing@gmail.com. After Wednesday, Feb. 16, noon CST, anyone is welcome to sign up.
* **Safety:** [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.

**1. Psi*Run:** You play Runners, amnesiacs with psionic powers, on the run from Chasers controlled by the GM. You learn who you are during play. Uses D6 dice pools.
[date=2022-02-18 time=18:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;America/Chicago&quot;] → [date=2022-02-18 time=21:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;America/Chicago&quot;] [Session 1](https://gauntletcalendar.com/event-detail/-MvUfkFsTmV7HeK1zvjO)

**2. NetWhere:** You play Hackers, people who are driven to find the Truth of the world and then deal with the consequences vs the Agents of Truth. Uses D6 dice pools and adds the gaining and spending of tokens for players and GM to alter reality. Inspired by The Matrix, Tron, The Adjustment Bureau, and Dark City.

**3. NightMirror:** You play Searchers, people who are obsessed with the supernatural in a world of monsters and madness. Uses a tarot deck instead of dice. Inspired by the TV show, Penny Dreadful.
