    <title>Advantage and Disadvantage in PBTA games</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/advantage-and-disadvantage-in-pbta-games/1016</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen a theme of advantage and disadvantage dice being added to some newer PBTA games (the first time I think I saw it was in Vagabonds of Dyfed), and I really don&#39;t know how I feel about them in play. I really love how they feel on paper, but in play they&#39;ve often fallen a bit flat.

My main problem is that I think that it makes rolling feel a bit pointless if there are any stacked attribute bonuses. By just having an attribute bonus of +1, rolling 3d6 and taking the highest 2 results in about 50% of the rolls being 10+. In VoD it says that:

&gt; Advantage and disadvantage are granted by the GM due to external factors, enemy abilities, or when a PC or NPC helps or hinders your action, using up their action in turn. 
Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, so if you have equal advantages and disadvantages, you roll at neither. If you have more advantages than disadvantages, you simply roll at advantage, and vice versa.

But, if the gm is just cancelling out his own advantage and disadvantage rulings to make a roll feel risky, is it even worth it? Does anyone have any examples of advantage and disadvantage working really well in  PBTA, or is it just kind of bad mechanic for PBTA games?</description>

              <p>Nice. I’ve been considering doing away with the “Get Involved” Move in UW (because it created a nested resolution that was a real speed-bump to the pace), and I was toying with characters able to commit their help by rolling a single dice, to be picked up by the main roller or not.

              <p>My opinion? Yes. It <em>feels</em> much better. Tactilely, it’s more gratifying. Psychologically, it feels more secure (or riskier for disadvantage).  Cognitively, there’s less to remember and there are fewer cases where you go “did you remember to take +1 forward? Oh, I guess it wouldn’t make a difference.”  Even if you forget to roll advantage until later, and then do, and it doesn’t change anything, it still feels better because it <em>could</em> have changed something.</p>
<p>If you use a number generator instead of dice, I can see how it’d be maybe more complex than beneficial. But I think it sings with physical dice.</p>

              <p>I think there are two different things here.</p>
<p>One use for advantage/disadvantage is to replace the idea of getting a +1/-1 bonus, usually because of some setup in the fiction (preparatory move, aid, debility, whatever). Effects like these, in the form of +1 forward or -1 ongoing or whatever, have been around since the beginning. Replacing them with advantage/disadvantage is an attempt to fix some issues which have been perceived with just the straight numerical bonus or penalty. The jury is out on which version is better, but they are clearly both trying to do the same thing. If I remember rightly, Legacy does this.</p>
<p>Another use for advantage/disadvantage, which I think is what you’re thinking of, is to model some kind of external factor, such as the extrinsic difficulty of the task as judged by the GM. That’s a different thing. Attempts to model the difficulty of tasks is something that RPGs have been doing since the year dot, and it’s an interesting feature of PbtA that it generally doesn’t do that. Here’s what Vincent Baker says about modelling extrinsic difficulty in Apocalypse World:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People new to the game occasionally ask me for this one. It’s general, it modifies nearly every other move:</p>
<p><em>Things are tough. Whenever a players’ character makes a move, the MC judges it normal, difficult, or seriously difficult. If it’s difficult, the player takes -1 to the roll. If it’s seriously difficult, the player takes -2 to the roll.</em></p>
<p>Several groups in playtest wanted this move or one like it. All of them abandoned it after only one session. It didn’t add anything fun to the game, but did add a little hassle to every single move. So it’s a legal custom move, of course, and you can try it if you like, but I wouldn’t expect you to stick with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I don’t know Vagabonds of Dyfed, so I don’t know which version that game uses, but I do think it’s important to distinguish.</p>

<p>Those figures are assuming that you don’t change anything from the earlier rules which means it wont be possible to crit unless you are rolling at least 3 dice. You could expand the exceptions above (post 27) to include the possibility of rolling 3 successes but it might start getting messy.</p>

              <p>Some great discussion here; as a new person on the forums, that’s nice to see!</p>
<p>Fooling around with other dice techniques for PbtA is something I have done a LOT. I also like the “look for 5-6s as successes” approach, which Brian posted above.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something +1ish that doesn’t change things too much, add a d4 to the roll (and keep the best two). It tends to increase the chance of a 7-9 (or reduce the chance of a miss) without giving you too many more 10+ results, which feels “right” to me.</p>
<p>It’s also “safe” to stack, if your game needs stacking for some reason - you can add a pile of d4s to your roll and it’s still interesting, instead of being a guaranteed 10+.</p>
<p>I also like rolling a pool of d6s as well as another polyhedral, and counting 6s (or higher) as “hits”. Works well for “choose one option per hit” from a list of 3, like “reading moves” or Seize by Force.</p>
<p>For example, I designed a system with a d6 pool from your stats (let’s say your Hard is 4d6, for example) and a variable die for fictional positioning (maybe you’re at advantage, so you get to roll a d10).</p>
<p>My game “the Bureau” has a helping mechanic where you roll and then you pass over one of your dice (without rerolling it). Makes helping under dangerous circumstances very risky!</p>
<p>Generally, I agree that for most PbtA games, you don’t want or need too much monkeying with the dice, though - advantage is better represented by the way the move is interpreted (especially on a miss) and by the choice of move you get to make in the first place.</p>

              <p>I think it works fine in this instance, as you aren’t rolling twice to resolve the same action. It’s more like the relationship between, say, Directly Engage &amp; Take a Powerful Blow in Masks. YMMV of course, but it didn’t seem to slow things down in the game last night</p>

              <p>That sounds really great (the aid/bond mechanic). Very slick and fun, and makes narrative sense as well. I would caution anyone from having a roll immediately trigger another roll as I’ve found this awkward and unsatisfying at the table in my own tests. I love how everything resolves in one roll right now!</p>

              <p>My only reservation on that is that currently it being the lowest dice triggers another move (Test a Covenant) which is a <em>really cool move</em> <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"> So I don’t think I’d want to give the the chance of opting out of this?

<p>(Not to distract too far from the main theme of the thread, but in short the Test a Covenant move makes you roll with the strength of the bond - on a hit, you say how your bond remains strong, with a 10+ increasing it, and failure makes it drop.

              <p>Oh I like that idea of having the extra die a simple but effective extra feedback into the fiction!</p>
<p>However, that the result is purely random is a bit off putting for me. What about the following:<br>
If you use the extra die from the other player in your final two, it strengthens the bond, if you don’t use it, the bond is weakened. Which would mean that you could prefer failing on a roll than failing on your friend. Or if it wouldn’t matter on the result stating something about your relationship by consciously taking or leaving the extra die out.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I played in this game, and I really loved how it actually made an Aid move not boring <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=9" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:"> Often I find players fictionally positioning to help out another character, but the move is pointless unless the active player rolls a 6 or 9, so it rarely seems worth using it. Whereas even if mathematically it doesn’t make a difference, the assisting player rolling the dice makes it feel more impactful. And the fact it fictionally adds some weight to the assisting players action too is really fun. (I loved the moment in our game last night where my character “helped” Angel’s legion commander to navigate, but made her job more difficult - but still successful. It was a real fun character moment)</p>

              <p>So last night I tested an Advantage/Disadvantage system and it worked really well! Basically, in Mysthea the Aid move works by giving someone you have a bond with one of your dice, to roll alongside their own. They pick the highest two, as per Advantage, but you also check where your dice fell in the pool - if it’s the highest you strengthen your bond, but if it’s lowest it weakens the bond. This turns Aid into something that moves the fiction of your relationship forward, and does that without calling for extra rolls - just adding an extra dimension to an existing roll. It also means multiple characters can aid another without being so overpowering that it robs the moment of drama.</p>

              <p>Here’s another idea that I’ve been toying with: You could take a little inspiration from Trophy (from Codex Dark 2) and have the other players offer advantage with a specific cost if they fail. Chances are that someone at the table has a better idea than you and it takes some pressure off of the gm, also if players know what they’re going to lose beforehand it might dissuade them from triggering advantage every turn.</p>

<p>You could say the same thing of every move. They trigger when the GM decides they trigger, ultimately. It’s just generally pretty easy to come to a consensus between the players at the table.</p>
