    <title>Tachyon Squadron: Above and Beyond (Nove)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/tachyon-squadron-above-and-beyond-nove/7411</link>
    <description>This is for five Tuesday November sessions of *Tachyon Squadron*, a game of space fighter pilots using  *Fate*. We will be playing with stunts and modifications to fit the setting and premise. Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. In session one we will talk safety, make up characters, establish relationships, and get to playing.

General RSVPs open 9/25

**The Pitch:**  The universe is in trouble. Take your stand against the overreaching arms of the Dominion of Unity. Stand up against piracy and lawlessness. Ensure that all members of the Draconis system enjoy peace and prosperity. Join the Tachyon Squadron arm of the Draconis Volunteer Group! Engage in interstellar combat; steer your ship among the stars, and join your fellow fighter pilots in a quest for danger, glory, and victory.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct ](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
