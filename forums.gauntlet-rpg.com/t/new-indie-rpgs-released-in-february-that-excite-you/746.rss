    <title>New indie rpgs released in February that excite you?</title>

    <description>Are there any new indie rpgs that were released last month that you&#39;re excited about (and maybe already played)? 
I&#39;m producing a podcast that will highlight a few, but am looking for other folks&#39; views on any gems in amongst them.

I have a list of (most of) them here: https://theindierpgpipeline.blogspot.com/2019/02/
(Note please ignore the crowdfunding and playtesting entries)</description>

              <p>I just received my copy of Crystal Healing, a trio of freeform RPGs by members of the band La Dispute. Only read the first one so far, but it looks very good. Deep emotional exploration with lots of safety notes. Each game has a different but equally simple mechanic (the first one uses a tumbling tower, the second a basic die roll, the third colored tokens).</p>
<p>Very excited to sit down with their album “Panorama” after I read the games written during the recording process.</p>

              <p>Just got Dream Apart in the mail and I’m really interested getting into a game of that, as well as Great American Novel, which was just Kickstarted and on +1 Forward.</p>
