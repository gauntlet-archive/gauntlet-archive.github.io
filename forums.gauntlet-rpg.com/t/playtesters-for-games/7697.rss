<p>That’s a useful tip. Thanks for sharing. I find discord a little painfully “silo’ed.” i.e. almost impossible to find anything from a web-search among other challenges.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/davidmk">@DavidMK</a>, I playtest anywhere and with anyone I can find, but here are a few tips/tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look for Discord servers that have active playtesting channels. For example, Magpie has a monthly community designers spotlight to test new games from designers that are part of their community. There are a couple of servers that are specific for designers as well, like RPG Talk and TTRPG Game Development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run sessions of games that are similar to yours. Even if your game is “unique,” it will have some DNA from other games. For example, my game mixes PbtA, FitD, Cypher System, and old-school D&amp;D. Unique? Sure. But I have run games in those other systems with a few hacks here and there (hacks that look/feel like the game I created), and after those sessions, I ask players if they would like to try a new game that has similar hacks to the ones I incorporated in that session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playtest with your usual group. That obviously requires a “usual” group “willing” to do it. The way I did it was like this: I first introduced the systems that would lead up to the game I have written. So I run a long campaign of Cypher System, a few one-shots of DW, and a couple of games of BitD for them. Then, I introduced my game, just a one-shot during an off week from our usual game. They enjoyed it so we started a long campaign. But I had to prepare them (similar to what I have to do in education when teaching a new concept: scaffolding the “lessons”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run your game at cons. Sometimes, it works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully that helps!</p>

</aside>
<p>Well – just because it’s been published doesn’t mean it works. Or that it works the first time you run it, or that it works for your group.<br>
Honestly I would say that for most players playing in a “playtest” just means that it will be like playing a system they’ve never played before.<br>
With the “bonus” of being able to comment on how things went or mechanics that they didn’t get at the end.</p>

              <p>OK true. But.<br>
We live in a constant flux of offers. Why playtest when we could be playing a new game that we know works. In a given group not everyone will be interested in the creative process. Play testing supposes some level of creative hype or dedication. I’ve found a few clubs with people with such mindsets now and play testing is more like “double feature”, so it’s not “either/or”, and more “by the way”.</p>

<p>That is normal. But it’s the only way to make your work better, or prove that it has potential. It is a playtest session, after all. I think people are there knowing that things will not be polished to perfection. I bet someone of them enjoy taking part in the creative process (while you do all the work of writing it).</p>

              <p>Alright, what do we need? Thinking outloud… maybe we need a collaborative sheet where we write up a blurb of what the playtest is about. Then testers write their names down for 1 hour slots?</p>
<p>I see already one objection (which must not stop anyone willing to implement such a test-rounds-table). What we are going to see I’m afraid is that some are more often available than others at prime time slots, so the machine will grind to a halt if we want to make participation time equal for each.</p>
<p>I’ve been wishing for a playtest group for years. Here’s what I find works best: a club. For playtests, you want to play maybe one hour slots, plus one hour of debriefing. You can halve the values for very specific gameloops. If you want to test a game of 4-5 hours sessions played in campaign mode, that’s really the same as finding a table of players, and a whole different question. In my mind’s eye, the key is to always have a slightly volatile pool of playful persons ready to play. That’s called a Discord server or a local gaming club. It could be Gauntlet’s calendar, but it’s too slow for me.</p>
<p>On a server, I have already done 15 minutes sessions with half an hour debrief, and that, repeated, is perfect for playtesting. I see a lot of “for play” chans active at lunch time or after dinner. At a club, you can squeeze either a 15 minutes “waiting” game loop with 15 minutes postponed debrief, or a 2 hours full playtest once a month. Of course, it will depend on the adequation of the members with the games you create. All in all, I’d say finding a Discord server where they play games similar to yours is the easiest, but you lose a lot of the spontaneity and non-verbal clues.</p>
<p>Thanks for your question, it allowed me to desentangle my thoughts.</p>

              <p>I mostly playtest on conventions and in my gaming groups. <strong>This is Pulp</strong> have had more than 100 playtesters, but with me as game master, and a couple of sessions where I attended as a player. I tried villages.cc for external playtesting, where you exchange time as a currency, but it backfired with me having to read through 500+ pages to even begin to playtest where my game were only about three pages long. I also think external playtesting requires recording.</p>
<p>I do take in amateurs as editors—fellow forum visitors or game designers—to give feedback on the text. Especially important when I write in English, because I’m not a native speaker.</p>
<p>My creation progress is a little bit different, however, because I create games through playtest. I write a skeleton, that my players then interpret and expand upon; almost like a scenario. The archetypes in This is Pulp only had a name and a tagline, and after the players (my group or at conventions) played with the archetypes, I used their actions as inspiration to write down two moves for each archetype.</p>
<hr>
<p>[edit] You will get the best feedback after you released the game, so one thing to consider is to release a cheaper and limited early beta <em>for print</em>. People that paid for your game are more inclined to give feedback. You basically having people paying to playtest for you.</p>
