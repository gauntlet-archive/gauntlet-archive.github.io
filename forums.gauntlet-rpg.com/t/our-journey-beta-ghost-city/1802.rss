    <title>Our Journey (Beta) - Ghost City</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/our-journey-beta-ghost-city/1802</link>
    <description>These are 3 sessions scheduled for 3 hours each. Attendance of all sessions is strongly encouraged. You have to RSVP to each session you want to join.

Beacon City is a sprawling metropolis that has drawn people from all over the world since it was founded hundreds of years ago. It is a melting pot dotted with several cultural boroughs that have their own places of worship and cemeteries. It is, of course, brimming with ghosts.

We&#39;ll tell the story of a group of young teens who acquire the ability to not only see ghosts, but to channel the power of their guardian (an ancient ghost that has watched over their family for generations) to perform supernatural feats. They&#39;ll have to use this power to deal with a crisis affecting the city&#39;s spirits.

Our Journey is a game in late stages of development that was built to tell stories of kids overcoming adversity and figuring out their identity by using supernatural powers and interacting with a mystical world. It is a light-weight, dice pool system that actively encourages character bonding and allows players to draw from that bond to deal with challenges.

The setting we&#39;ll be playing in draws mostly from Shaman King, but has some American Gods spice as well.

The X-card will be used, and we will be observing the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
