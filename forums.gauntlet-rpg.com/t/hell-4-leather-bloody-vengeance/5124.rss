    <title>Hell 4 Leather: Bloody Vengeance</title>

    <description>You were the meanest most-badass S.O.B. around.

Everything was tight–you rode with the Devil’s Dozen– toughest chapter going. No one messed with you.

Except…

Your “buddies” screwed you. Life is cheap. What’s a little murder between pals?

But all that Satanism paid off, who’da thunk it? Bad news for the puppies, good news for you. You cut a deal with The Devil. You got one night - Devil’s Night - to exact vengeance. You’re gunna show those bastards what a REAL Angel of Hell can do.

When the rooster crows, your chance for revenge is over—you’ve gotta go Hell For Leather!

Hell 4 Leather is a GM-less story-game of bloody vengeance inspired by tales of revenge as diverse as Hamlet, Kill Bill, The Crow and Ghost Rider. 

[date=2020-05-19 time=08:00:00 format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;Australia/Perth&quot;] → [date=2020-05-19 time=12:00:00 format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;Australia/Perth&quot;] [Hell 4 Leather: Bloody Vengeance](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-M682g8pz-FPHT8X096i)

I hope we can finish the session in around 3 hours, but not having played before, the extra hour is available if necessary. We will be using Streamyard &amp; playingcards.io, and the session will be recorded with the agreement of all participants. The game will go ahead with 2 or more signups.

Content Warning: it will be very hard to play this game without occultism (probably Satanism) and murder. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.</description>
