    <description>**You will be required to read material from the core rulebook. If you do not have time, cannot make time or will not make time to read this material *before your first session,* please do not sign up for any sessions.**

![55|500x500](upload://qpr5EAI423OiaQokOgwQtXmj84s.jpeg) 

You are survivors trapped on the edge of the Wild, living in the graveyard of rural towns left behind by the cyberpunk future. There’s crumbling roads, unpredictable digital networks, experimental livestock escaped into the woods, rusting cyberware, and hungry monsters stalking the perimeter.
Those who could, fled to urban sanctuaries and virtual realities. There, everything they do is recorded by the digital Feed, and everything they perceive is filtered by it. This means people have unprecedented control on defining reality...free of facts.
But this isn’t their story. This is the story of those who stayed——by choice, or by misfortune——to scratch out a living in the unpaved places.

These are nine sessions of Cass Kay’s [Ruralpunk](http://www.ruralpunk.net). The sessions will be streamed on YouTube Live and recorded for Gauntlet Hangouts. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend. By signing up to a session, you agree to read material from the core rulebook before your first session.

**Safety Tools:** We will use [Script Change](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change) and [Lines and Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913) during our sessions. We will observe the [Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

**Unfortunately I&#39;ve had to cancel the sessions.**</description>
