    <title>Musical Inspiration for Games</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/musical-inspiration-for-games/3025</link>
    <description>With all the games on the Gauntlet, and with the release of Once Again We Return, I have been wondering about how other people approach music and their games. Personally I love &quot;theme songs&quot; for characters or just inspirational pieces to listen to while creating game ideas.

Most recently I found a song that has a video that really goes with the feel of Monsterhearts.

CW: People dancing in underwear, may be slightly NSFW. Better safe than sorry.

[Sir Babygirl - Haunted House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0c71QCx4ug)

To me this feels like the anthem of a Ghost in Monsterhearts, someone who died at a party and was dumped in the woods and never found.

So, what has been inspiring you lately or was a favorite theme for a character of yours?</description>

              <p>I have a hard time picking one specific theme song a lot of the time, because I’m awful about making definitive decisions like that, but I absolutely make playlists for just about every game or character I get really into. They often end up turning into pseudo-soundtracks, where each song will make me think of a montage or theme for that character. Alternatively, I’ll get a lot of ideas from hearing a song and some lyric or vibe sparks something for me.</p>
<p>I’ll try to avoid totally geeking out and going too overboard, so I’ll just name a couple for my favorite characters =P</p>

              <p>I’ve never picked a specific theme song for any of my characters, but I put an inordinate amount of effort into making soundtracks for my games. I’ll make custom playlists on Spotify for encounters I’ve set up and stress out way too much over having appropriate music playing during scenes. The most fun I had was pulling together all the soundscapes for a game of <strong>Dread</strong> that I ran, there is a wealth of ambient sound generators with outrageous amounts of customization for what stuff plays in them and with what frequency.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I often have songs that I occassionally associate with a character of mine, but they usually do not encompass them. Like Asian Dub Foundation’s “La Haine” was a good representation for my character’s cold, murderous side, but it didn’t adress anything else. But I was able to weave that into a game where the monster hunters were after a siren and he needed something to plug his ears with.</p>
<p>…also, I once ran a “Star Wars Bollywood Musical”, where the players actually sang (or rapped) for their characters, and it was just as epic as you’d think. Palpatine stole every scene!</p>
