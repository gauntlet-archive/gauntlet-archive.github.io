    <description>I’m designing a world building class for undergraduates and i want to see if i can provide them with a robust list of games to tackle that task. This is distinct from games with world building components in them or zines full of roll tables that randomize pregenerated ideas, I’m looking for games dedicated specifically to gamifying world-building. Here’s the start:
•	Beak, Feather, and Bone (ZQ2) – maps
•	Companion’s Tale – maps 
•	I’m sorry did you say street magic (ZQ2) – city map
•	Microscope - long history
•	Dawn of Worlds – long history
•	A Thousand Years Under the Sun – rise and fall of an empire
•	Empire – collapsing empire 
•	Downfall – collapsing empire
•	Icarus – collapsing empire
•	Dialect - languages and communities
•	The Quiet Year – local community, map
•	The Legacy Weapon - magical weapons
•	Artefact (ZQ2) - magical weapons
•	For the Queen – characters
•	Decuma (Kickstarter) - All</description>

              <p>This is also not a game per se BUT it is my favorite worldbuilding tool.  <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145675/Beyond-the-Wall--Further-Afield">Further Afield for Beyond the Wall and Other Adventures</a>  This book is really an EXCELLENT worldbuilding tool for any OSR or trad style rpg.  The idea is players decide a possible Truth like in Yochaigal’s example but for a specific location.  Then, the player rolls against whatever skill / attribute allowed them to learn this.</p>
<p>E.g. in a typical OSR game, where the player says they learned the truth through persuading a local, then you would roll against Charisma.  If the roll is well below the Charisma score (like 5+ below), the truth is confirmed as is.</p>
<p>If the player passes but just barely, then the general point is correct but something is not quite right with the info.  Perhaps, the player says there are castle ruins full of kobalds and magical items in Hex 2 but really the castle ruins are full of lizard men instead or only when the PCs get to where they though the castle ruins lie, do they finally see the castle ruins in the distance.</p>
<p>Continuing the same example, if the player barely fails (by less than 5 or so), then the player is seriously wrong or the info is seriously out of date about a major detail but otherwise correct.  Like the castle ruins are in Hex 2 but the ruins are now partly flooded and contains kua toa and magic items instead.</p>
<p>Then, a major fail means only 1 point is correct. Like the castle ruins were already ransacked for the magic items.  Now there is just a bit of gold, the ruins are unstable, and trolls have been spotted nearby.</p>

<li>Dream Apart (Buried Without Ceremony);</li>

<p>In these GM-less games, everyone plays two roles: an individual character, and a faction, force in play, or community aspect. The details of the world and communities are created as you play.</p>

              <p>This list is amazing. Thank you all for your contributions. A few things I’m noticing from this list: 1) there’s a heavy emphasis placed on large empires and factions, less emphasis placed on small communities; 2) the development of these communities is almost always about power, and not, say, cultural growth, customs, traditions, languages (except Dialect); 3) nearly all of these are about decline; and 4) very little emphasis placed on character creation.</p>
<p>I’m guessing that (4) has to do with the fact that characters are created in-game by players, but I wonder if there are NPC-generating games.</p>
<p>As for (2), I wonder if there is a space for world-building games that generate a community’s cultural productions: what resources do they have; what can you make from those resources; how do those forms evolve; how do they shape communities? Sounds like a project for Zine Quest 3.</p>

              <p>I would be remiss to not mention <strong>For The Queen</strong> (<a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/for-the-queen/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.evilhat.com/home/for-the-queen/</a>). Especially if you are looking for a game with a super simplistic rule-set and accessible by almost anyone as far as skill, experience, interest, etc. I have played the game where at least 2-3 times we either used it after a world-building game, or as world-building for a later game. It focuses on a very small group, but the lessons that it teaches the players about listening and asking questions, and collaborating are invaluable to collaborative world-building.</p>
<p>And thematically there are now so many other variants, of which these are just a fraction: <a href="https://forthequeengame.com/games" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forthequeengame.com/games</a>.</p>
<p>As an example, my partner J created one hack called The Outsiders (title will be changing to possibly “The Newly Arrived”) which is about a group of new people trying to join an established community. Because the tone and setting is so open ended, we’ve used it for post-apoc fiction, a pack of wolves, elves trying to join Santa’s Workshop, and a ton more. Again, you could use this to collaboratively create aspects of a world and culture that is then used in other games and fiction.</p>

              <p><strong>Icarus</strong> by <a class="mention" href="/u/spenser_starke">@Spenser_Starke</a> is also built as a one-shot that explores the downfall of a society at its zenith. Very successful KickStarter, now in full release, and I’ve played a number of times and it works exceedingly well in a short timeframe. You can easily use it to then spin off further stories in the aftermath (or history of) the world created.

It is the “R&amp;D for your RPG” and meant very specifically to help do the world building for campaigns and parties. I’ve played it and it combined many elements of things I love about some of the games mentioned.</p>
