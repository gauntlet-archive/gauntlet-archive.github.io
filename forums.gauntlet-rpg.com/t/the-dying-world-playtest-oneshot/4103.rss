**For the first 72 hours of access, please sign up for the game if you are a member of a marginalized community. Thank you!**

This session is scheduled for 4 hours. The session will be recorded if everyone is cool with it! If not, no worries. We will be using Streamyard. I will email everyone one week ahead of the game.

***The multiverse has shattered! And in this shattering, would be heroes rise. Imbued with powers of the Shattering, they have one last chance to save their worlds!***

***Play as one of five archetypes: The King of Cups, the Queen of Swords, the Princess of Wands, the Prince of Pentacles, and the Scion of the Void. The system is based on Grant Howitt&#39;s Royal Blood, and uses the tarot to create characters, and determine task resolution. The stakes are high and feel high in this one shot!***

Please note that this is a playtest! I&#39;ll do my best to provide an awesome experience but there may be some hiccups.

Safety tools: We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
