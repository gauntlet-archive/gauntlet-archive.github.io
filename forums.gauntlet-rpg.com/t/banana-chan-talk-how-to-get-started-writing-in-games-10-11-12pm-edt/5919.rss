    <description>Banana Chan [@bananachangames](https://twitter.com/bananachangames), co-designer of the forthcoming (super exciting) Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall rpg, is giving a FREE talk on &quot;How To Get Started Writing In Games&quot; on October 11 at 12:00 EDT. It&#39;s a great opportunity to learn more about writing games from someone who&#39;s worked on board games and ttrpgs. It will be livestreamed and archived on [@TabletopNet](https://twitter.com/TabletopNet)&#39;s YouTube channel, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xzgzLnk0rcl7Ygc6Mi69Q. Hopefully the Gauntlet can invite Banana Chan to run games &amp; give talks at future online events! Until then, check her out on 10/11!</description>
