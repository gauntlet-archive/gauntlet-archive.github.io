    <description>So ... What&#39;s on your wish list ... as GM &amp;/or Player?
For my part I&#39;m hoping to work my through my settings wishlist: Achtung! Cthulhu Dark; Night&#39;s Black Agents; Scion; Dresden Files; Soliman Kane; and 7th Sea.

My system wishlist ... Band of Blades &amp;/or Blades in the Dark; Tides of Gold &amp;/or Rapscallion; Urban Shadows; Sprawl &amp;/or Veil.

What are you interested in?</description>

              <p>On the system front: I’ve managed to get into Lowell’s <strong>Veil: Fantasy</strong> series and, though Blades in the Dark has passed me by this Autumn, I’m claiming a series of <strong>Hack the Planet</strong> (which is FitD) in its place.  Annoyingly I didn’t spot <a class="mention" href="/u/leandrop">@LeandroP</a>’s <strong>The Sprawl</strong> session in Gauntlet Con before booking other games, so it remains my white whale for the Spring.</p>
<p>I have managed to squeeze some <strong>Demigods</strong> into the Gauntlet Calendar in December so that I can tentatively mark <em>Scion</em> off my Autumn setting list - hope it goes well as it’s someting I’d like to play more of.  No room, though, for <em>Dresden Files</em>, <em>Soloman Kane</em> or <em>7th Sea</em> (though my <strong>Rapscallion</strong> 2-shot might just count … a bit … for the latter?).</p>
<p>Listening to <a class="mention" href="/u/alexi_sarge">@Alexi_Sarge</a>’s 1950 Vienna Urban Shadows session (<a href="http://gauntlet.hellomouth.net/?name=20190930__Urban_Shadows_-_Vienna_1950_Session_1_4__Cloven_Pine_Games.mp3" rel="nofollow noopener">http://gauntlet.hellomouth.net/?name=20190930__Urban_Shadows_-_Vienna_1950_Session_1_4__Cloven_Pine_Games.mp3</a>) has reminded me of <strong>Cold City</strong> (<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20677/Cold-City-v11" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20677/Cold-City-v11</a>) which has sat on my hard drive for a decade, if not more.</p>
<p>I’m thinking it might be possible to drift my <strong>Achtung! Cthulhu Dark</strong> hack (itself a drift of Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley) to play a game about <em>'… hunting monsters and eldritch creatures in Berlin during the early part of the Cold War, a time when the city is slowly rebuilding itself …</em>’ and <em>‘… the characters are drawn from the former allies who now occupy Germany …’.</em>  Perhaps this is a Xmas Break Project …</p>

<p>Keeping up with the Kevin Crawford fan train, <strong>Godbound</strong> is a game I keep visiting over and over in my head, coming up with character concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Under Hollow Hills</strong>, although still in early draft stages (kinda) seems really interesting. One of the few PbTA I’d really want to play right now.</p>
<p><strong>Zweihander</strong>, <strong>13th Age</strong> and <strong>Deep Morphean Transmissions</strong> also look really interesting.</p>

Now that I’ve read the rules I’m not sure it’s going to be the perfect vehicle for 7th Sea … Seems much more Pirates of the Carib. However, I’ll know better after these 2 sessions.  Either way it ticks another game off my system wishlist, so what’s not to like.<br>
Feel free to waitlist as my player groups have been incredibly volatile this last month or so … The joy of Open Table!</p>

The 2 x 2-shots of Night’s Black Operators (using the Operator rules to run the Night’s Black Agents setting I ran in August weren’t perfect but were a sufficiently positive proof of concept for me to put a series up in October.<br>
Scion; Dresden Files; Soliman Kane; and 7th Sea … Still in the wish-list …</p>

Band of Blades &amp;/or Blades in the Dark -  played in my first BoB session this week and goodness there’s a lot to keep track of in that system!<br>
Tides of Gold - I ran this at a Con in August and it seemed a much more forgiving FitD than BoB, for instance.  I’m wondering whether it (or Rapscallion … also on my system list) might bring 7th Sea to the table in Dec. … so technically missing Ng my Autumn window.<br>
Urban Shadows; Sprawl &amp;/or Veil - still on the list to scratch my Cyberpunk itch.</p>
