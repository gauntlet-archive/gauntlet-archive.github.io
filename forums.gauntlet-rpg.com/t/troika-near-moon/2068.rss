A spherical moon come to Earth, suspended less than a bow-shot above the soil. The mile-high sphere, dusty and cratered, mocks astounded travelers. In the noon-daylight the Near Moon looms ash-grey, the color of a ghost’s ghost. Skyscrapers and towers and stairs of a half-dozen fallen cultures slither out of the dank bogs beneath the Near Moon, peopled by hermits, hardy soldiers, and living dead keeping moonlings of quaint disposition. They bridge the airy void, coming within a ten-foot of the Near Moon and its strange gravity. Everyone in the Ultraviolet Grasslands has heard the old tales that there is a palace inside the Near Moon, a precious hall of crystal and gems, priceless beyond imagining. Of course this is not true, any sage would say.

This is a sequel to the Gauntlet Games Now game which ended with our two main characters set sail on a golden barge to study moon-goblins.

This event is scheduled to run for 4 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
