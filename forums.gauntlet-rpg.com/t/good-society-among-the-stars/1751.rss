    <title>Good Society: Among the Stars</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/good-society-among-the-stars/1751</link>
    <description>Each session is scheduled for 3 hours, except for the first one, which will last an additional half hour. Attendance of all four sessions is strongly encouraged. You have to RSVP to each session you want to join.

In the distant future, humanity has perfected space travel and populated the stars. Among the infinite galaxies lies a peculiar little cluster of civilization. There, in the Habershire System, a cluster of dozens of small space stations, most housing a single family, orbits a beautiful, uncolonized, green and blue planet.

All who live in the Habershire Cluster are part of a social contract called &quot;The Dance&quot;, which is an emulation of Regency Era society with a few changes. We will tell the story of a group of people who devote their lives to upholding their (randomly-assigned) social status, having fun, searching for meaning, and/or looking for love.

This is a reskin of Good Society, which is &quot;a game of balls, estates, sly glances, and turns about the garden—at least on the surface. Underneath this, it is a game about social ambition, family obligation, and breathtaking, heart-stopping longing.&quot;

The X-card will be used, and we will be observing the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
