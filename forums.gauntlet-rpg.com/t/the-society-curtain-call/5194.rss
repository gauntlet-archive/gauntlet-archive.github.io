Who knew this world existed just underneath the surface, like goosebumps or hair standing on edge? After you were turned, you realized the mortal world is composed of more lies than you ever could have guessed — easier to act like a sheep. But now you’re a wolf and the world is cold and cruel in new ways. Perhaps what you are still coming to terms with, however, is the politicking; the centuries- (sometimes millennia-) old masquerading and backstabbing for inscrutable ends, endlessly perpetuated by those much older than you..are you a pawn? Was becoming a vampire just a move in another vamp’s game? Who knows.

These are five sessions of *The Society* by Darren Brockes, a game of vampires and secrets Rooted in Trophy. This is a playtest. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend.

We’ll use [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/) and [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/). I’ll email all players about a week before the session with necessary information and links.

**Content Warnings:** blood, loss of humanity, embodying monstrosity, social manipulation, killing
**Safety Tools:** [Script Change](http://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/), [Lines and Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913), the [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)
