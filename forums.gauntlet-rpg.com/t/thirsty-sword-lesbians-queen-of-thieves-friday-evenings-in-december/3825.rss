    <title>Thirsty Sword Lesbians: Queen of Thieves (Friday evenings in December)</title>

    <description>For nearly a decade, you&#39;ve been robbing rich nobles who pass through your forest. They&#39;ve never managed to catch you or find your hideout. Admittedly, they didn&#39;t try that hard. They had bigger things to worry about. As long as you didn&#39;t get too greedy, you weren&#39;t considered much of a threat.

But the new Sheriff is ruthless, vengeful, and has vowed to wipe out every last outlaw in the forest, and you&#39;ll need all your fighting, seduction, and/or magic skills to save your village.

Yes, this is exactly what it sounds like. Queer Robin Hood, using the PbtA adventure/romance game _Thirsty Sword Lesbians._
