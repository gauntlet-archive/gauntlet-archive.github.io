    <title>What is that dice rolling app?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/what-is-that-dice-rolling-app/2903</link>
    <description>Hi - I hate to post this here, but I&#39;m on my work computer, and I&#39;m trying to find that dice rolling web-app that is basically a shared desktop. I can&#39;t remember the name of it... 

It may have been created by Shane Liebling?

Can someone help?

Thanks,
Chris</description>
