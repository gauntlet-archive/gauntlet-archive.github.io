    <description>I present to you the &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/02/crowdfunding-collection-132-part-1-of-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;new Crowdfunding Collection #132 – Part 1 of 2, including every tabletop rpg project started between 01/26 and 02/02&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

February introduces the Zine Quest 2 Kickstarter event, which follows a very productive week in regards to projects started. Thus there are a total of 79 projects, about 26 offering new games. To make it a bit more accessible, I decided to split the collection.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/02/crowdfunding-collection-132-part-2-of-2-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;Do take a look at part 2!&lt;/a&gt;

I will start by focusing on the „normal“ projects.
&lt;b&gt;Cowebs&lt;/b&gt; will be a game by Exalted Funerals, which offers a Neo Noir experience. Basically a game in the wake of FFO Limetown, Mind Mgmt and The X-Files. There are cases with a twist, which needed to be explored and revealed. It’s a gm-less game, that utilizes a fascinating looking „map“ and is played with 4d6 and 1d12. I recommend having a look. After ending its Kickstarter successfully &lt;b&gt;Hexagon&lt;/b&gt; continues it with a IndieGoGo campaign. I would take a look, though flexible funding and to many other projects are keeping me away.
One of the many other cool projects is &lt;b&gt;The Elephant &amp; Macaw Banner Role-Playing Game&lt;/b&gt;. Based on the novel by the same name it offers a uniquely Brazilian setting. I like the description, illustrations and am very tempted to back it. Especially with Tom McGreney having proven to be a reliable creator. &lt;b&gt;Red Rook Revolt!&lt;/b&gt; is another fantasy game that caught my eye. The players assume the role of revolutionaries fighting against an imperial power. I am quite fascinated that the game addresses aspects like different views on families and on the working of the comunes. The system is mostly a bespoke one. Another cool project, well and a patreon, is &lt;b&gt;The Chronicles of Ember&lt;/b&gt;. Which aims to essentially provide a Dark Souls experience. Like, not so much the mechanics, but the setting. The system it self apparently offers like 4 classes and a lot of skills. Just take a look.  If you want your fantasy more classical, take a look at &lt;b&gt;Swords and Wizardry&lt;/b&gt;. Which is like super classic fantasy with an OSR like system. Mostly offering a ultimate collectors edition. Grab it if you like it. I do consider &lt;b&gt;Pride of Giants&lt;/b&gt; quite cool, with the giant bee-monster an all. System-wise it’s d20 with tons of skills. Offering a delicious crunchy meal. Last but not least you’ll find the &lt;b&gt;Venture &amp; Dungeon&lt;/b&gt; fantasy games. Yeah, games. Two at once. With a PbtA-like system. Focused on belonging. Which is quite interesting.
You might be looking for a more universal system. &lt;b&gt;Era d10 Fundamentals&lt;/b&gt; is a hack for the Era games and offers you the opportunity to build your own with the system. Just take a look. Another universal game is &lt;b&gt;GMD Core RPG&lt;/b&gt;, which looks nice.
There are two games combining various game styles. &lt;b&gt;Blastback: Sci-Fi Superhero Escape Horror RPS&lt;/b&gt; combines Escape games and tabletop rpg for an Urban Fantasy game. Then there’s. &lt;b&gt;Band Battle Royale&lt;/b&gt;, which mixes up role-playing with card games to make the players band famous.
Considering there’s &lt;b&gt;Choose Cthulhu 2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;All for Anvil&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Alice’s Nightmare in Wonderland&lt;/b&gt; you might basically roll around in game books. Where I like to give a shoutout towards Alice’s Nightmare in Wonderland, as I enjoyed the original project.
There are a lot of cool projects, like the &lt;b&gt;Dice for All&lt;/b&gt; – even as they are imho to pricey -, the transparent dice, stuff like the &lt;b&gt;Simple Spell Tracker&lt;/b&gt; and many projects more.
Just take a look:
