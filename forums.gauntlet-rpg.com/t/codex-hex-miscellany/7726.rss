    <title>Codex Hex - Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-hex-miscellany/7726</link>
    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Hex! This one is called “Three Dozen Misfired Spells.” For each entry, we would like to know what the spell was supposed to do and what happened instead when it misfired. If you want inspiration for some spells and intended effects, pages 8-9 of Trophy Gold have some good lists and may be viewed here:[ shorturl.at/doMN7](http://shorturl.at/doMN7)

Submissions should be no more than 1-3 short sentences. By submitting here in the replies, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please do not submit any entries with sexist imagery (we won’t publish it).

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

For this miscellany, we’re looking for things that are fantastical, horrifying, and occasionally humorous or ironic. Here are some examples:

“Logan Stormcloak never considered widening the scope of his bound spirit ritual could force his companions’ spirits into the simulacrum, let alone his own spirit. Now the whole party harasses him as he tries to commune with his soulless body and get it to carry the simulacrum to help.”

“Casting magical force attacks seemed so easy, but no one mentioned that the true name for “force” and “phalange&#39;&#39; were surprisingly similar. Here’s hoping hand regrowth spells are more straight forward, but that seems like wishful thinking.”

“Time magic never seems to go as intended. At least this misfire means you’ll have the chance to correct your misspent youth.”</description>

You’d find yourself 1 minute in the past, unable to deviate from your previous actions as you relived all 60 terrible seconds while suffering sickening deja vu. Found out later some wizard was casting a “rewind” spell. <em>They</em> could move during its effects, but no one else in range could. For all that, their fancy magic didn’t save them getting torn apart by a crowd of nauseous locals once word got out.</p>

I read and conjured it, and here I was walking barefoot on solid water. The gnolls couldn’t, I was saved. I turned at them, mocked them, and doing so I let go the scroll in the water stream. The formula to stop the spell was on it. Now, any water is like solid stone for me. That rain was hurtful, and I cannot drink any water. What have I done ?!</p>

              <p>The levitation spell is not too hard to learn but requires years to master. Casting a levitation spell on a living being, especially on a friendly one, was strictly forbidden for centuries unless you had been approved by the 7th circle of the higher arts of magic. The levitation spell despite it’s civil reputation can cause one of the most horrific deaths as for the slightest mistake, the target’s blood will only flow up and not down anymore, therefore the body will start rotting from the toes upwards within minutes. Treatment by binding the target to a wheel and spinning it for 7 days straight will only increase the target’s survival rate to a mere 9%.</p>

              <p>Dario pushed his hands and senses deep into the loam, calling to the seedlings to spring forth into life and Germinate. His focus wavered for a moment and he screamed as he felt roots and tendrils drill into his hands and arms and thrust their way, under his skin, up and into his chest. Now Dario keeps a sharp pair of shears with him at all times to prune the vines that burst forth from the green pustules that cover his skin.</p>

              <p>In the Unseen Academy they practice a spell to unveil the resonance of other realms: the sounds of hidden worlds brushing up against our own. Their drop-outs are most often those who weave the spell <em>too</em> well—so that they feel the music tingling on their skin &amp; thrumming on the inside of their bones. Soon other voices whisper in their throats; soon, their hearts beat to the alien rhythm.</p>

              <p>Fire. A simple thing. Some stone and flint. But no, you wanted to get fancy. From old tomes, you found a spell called Spark written in a language you barely understood, wrapped in metaphor. A tiny flame is conjured, yes, but from the heart of an angry star. For 2 terrible seconds, a campfire’s kindling explodes with plasma and trees for miles around burst into flame.</p>

              <p>One of my ancestors discovered a loophole in magic. He made a kind of fiddly target self spell that worked in conjunction with others, so if he casted mass armor on 5 people, he gained 5 times the armor and they gained nothing. His demise was spectacular, as the target self hadn’t gone out when he decided to cast fireball on 30 goblins.</p>

              <p>Reanimating the dead is usually a simple, at times industrial, magic – binding lost spirits to old bones and rotted flesh, trapping the energy of the dead in forms it recognizes and forcing its screaming efforts to escape into new productive routes. Mistakes happen though when the untrained bring their own force and will to the process, and many a fledgling necromancer has found themselves staring mute at their own slumped body from behind the clouded eyes of corpse.</p>

              <p>Creating a Zone of Truth is simple enough magic, and it’s important not to over complicate it. Gryx, the Archmage at the local college, once up-casted it on his colleague to prove a point. Little did Gryx know that instead of forcing his friend to tell the truth, his version forced what his friend said to become true. You should have seen the room when his friend called him a “boastful, crotchety old mountain goat.”</p>
