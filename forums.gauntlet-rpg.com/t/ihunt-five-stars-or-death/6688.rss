    <title>#iHunt: Five Stars or Death</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/ihunt-five-stars-or-death/6688</link>
    <description>This is for the five sessions of *#iHunt* a game about monster-hunting in the gig economy on Monday evenings in May (US Eastern),. Being able to attend each session is encouraged, but not required. #*iHunt* uses a modified version of the *Fate*  rules. Rules will be taught and in the first session we will establish tone, set boundaries, discuss out campaign frame, and create characters. One seat is being reserved.

*Open RSVP begins March 15.*

*Content Warning: This game leans into questions of poverty, survival, and desperate circumstances. These elements will likely overhang everything.*

**About iHunt**
Be a hero. You pick the hours.

*#iHunt* is a story telling game about killing monsters in the gig economy. In it, you play millennials scraping by paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet. A gig app called #iHunt offers them more money than they&#39;ve ever made to hit the streets and kill vampires, werewolves, demons, and anything else that goes bump in the night. 

* *#iHunt* uses a modified version of the [Fate Core Rulebook](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/). 
* It&#39;s a high-drama, story-heavy urban fantasy roleplaying game.
* It takes a critical look at the gig economy with irreverent humor.

We will be using Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct ](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
