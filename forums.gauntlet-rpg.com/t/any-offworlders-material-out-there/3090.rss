    <title>Any Offworlders! material out there?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/any-offworlders-material-out-there/3090</link>
    <description>So, I have never played a PbtA game. Not even one. I took part in a zero session of Masks once (and I really enjoyed it) but the game fell apart before we could start. I have taken a look at World of Dungeons and like it, but I really connected with Offworlders! I&#39;m curious if anybody has created material supplemental to the main book. Anything at all. skills, powers, classes, etc. Blogs or books or threads. 

ALSO: If I were to check out a PbtA game that would be an &quot;advanced&quot; edition of Offworlders!, what would you suggest? Scum &amp; Villainy seems good, but I also know there are a few others out there that fall in the SF camp.</description>

              <p>Thank you. I didn’t realize there was a difference between PbtA and FitD. I need to better acquaint myself with these types of games.</p>

              <p>There’s an official page <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/" rel="nofollow noopener">listing PbtA games</a>, and it’s got a <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/games/browse/science_fiction" rel="nofollow noopener">science fiction section</a>. <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/games/title/Uncharted_Worlds" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Uncharted Worlds</em></a> looks like it’s in the same vaguely <em>Traveller</em>-esque conceptual space as <em>Offworlders</em>.</p>
<p><em>Scum &amp; Villainy</em> is Forged in the Dark, and while some people say that FitD is a subset of PbtA, the two systems feel to me like they’re mechanically distinct enough to be treated as separate systems.</p>
