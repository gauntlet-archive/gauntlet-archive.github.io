    <title>Godbound: Shattered Pillars</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/godbound-shattered-pillars/6949</link>
    <description>This is for the first month of a quarterly series of *Godbound*, a high fantasy game of new divinities played with an old-school system. In this game of exploration and growth you will play emerging gods in the aftermath of a cosmic war, just coming into your powers. In session one we will set tone and safety, make characters, establish facts about our world, and get playing. We will be utilizing some elements from *Thousand Thousand Islands*.

*These sessions are in July on Wednesday evneings US Eastern. General RSVP opens 5/15.* 

Rules will be taught (familiarity with retroclone and OSR games will be helpful). Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. One seat is being reserved. Players in the first month will have right of first refusal for the following two.

“*Godbound* is a game of divine heroes in a broken world, of men and women who have seized the tools that have slipped from an absent God&#39;s hands. Bound to the Words of Creation, these new-forged titans face a world ravaged by madmen and fools. Their foes are many: jealous parasite gods, a furious Angelic Host that once held Heaven against the armies of men, and endless legions of sorcerers, god-monsters, mortal tyrants, and eldritch relicts. The **Godbound** stand against these horrors, determined to forge a better world from the fragments of the old.“

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
