    <description>I&#39;m a fan of OSR-style games that are light on rules (like Into the Odd, for example).  I find it quite strange, though, that however much they incentivise players to avoid combat where possible (i.e. low HP) they *don&#39;t* choose to fill their pages with rules on things *other* than hitting things and damaging them.

I mean, creatures and NPCs are generally defined largely in terms of their AC, HD, etc.  But then they&#39;re also kind of saying &quot;probably best not to fight things if you can help it&quot;.  But why don&#39;t more games therefore have at least as many rules/stats, if not more, for exploring a navigating a wilderness or reading an ancient tome?</description>

Rolls in this game with 4 pages of mechanics are reserved for only when an action is risky and the consequences make it dangerous.  Sure, most of the mechanics listed are for combat but the understanding is that most dangerous and risky maneuvers will be during combat and the main mechanic is used for all risky situations.</p>

<p>I like that game but it’s also a solo experience, so if I sit there for 30 minutes noodling on a particular puzzle no one is going to get frustrated or bored. But if someone’s just sitting watching me think about a puzzle like that… well there just doesn’t seem to be enough at stake to make that interesting.</p>

<p>Something to note in the vein of this sort of game would be real life escape rooms. Bringing that to a TTRPG would probably need an order of magnitude more thinking to prepare an adventure.</p>

              <p>The large variety of “general resolution” mechanics is a sign of this - you’ve got Stat based rolls, saving throws, D100 based skills, attack rolls and listening or search checks off the top of my head - and all of these can be used at when the GM makes the ad hoc decision that a roll is necessary to resolve the random aspect of a player action or setting response to player action.  This is part of what I meant above discussing esoteric systems - there’s no general roll and hence no gaming the general roll.  GM decision making power and as hoc resolution mechanics tends towards narrative (vs. mechanical) solutions - that is you want your scheme to sound plausible and effective rather then use the code words that relate directly to the mechanics.</p>

              <p>The expectation is the GM will come up with a ruling for the “non-combat” action. Most games have some sort of general resolution mechanic, so this isn’t usually tricky. (You might roll under your charisma attribute if you are trying to negotiate with an NPC, perhaps.) I find in most OSR games I’ve played in people spend more time talking than rolling dice or leaning on mechanics to accomplish a task. It’s about clever solutions and problem solving.</p>

So tracking torches or rations may be part of the rules but it’s usually not tied to a resolution mechanism.</p>
<p>Basically, I was using “resolution mechanism” as the fortune part of (my internalized version of) the drama/karma/fortune triad, whereas much of resource management is karma resolution and much of OSR type problem solving is drama resolution.</p>

Just to add my two coppers to the others, on top of resource management (light, time, encumbrance, etc) there’s the role playing bit of the game. I enjoy the strategic roll playing involved in a great game, but if players can make it out of a dangerous situation with ingenuity and not having to roll a single die, well that’s fun too! There are morale and reaction tables, but if someone does all the right things to avoid the trap, or make off with the magical gem from the sleeping dragon’s horde, then they may not necessarily need a FaRT or Move Silently roll. That feel of the old school game makes it what it is; and of course there’s no wrong way to have fun, so to each their own!</p>

              <p>Worth mentioning one of my favorite games, a spin on OSR that has 0 combat: <a class="mention" href="/u/richrogers">@RichRogers</a> Bat Hack.  In place of combat is the “Diamond Crawl,” a set of tools to simulate a baseball game.  Rich had the insight that story emerges from OSR play in a way similar  to how it emerges from sports: Spontaneously from the interaction of rules, player actions and decisions and observers’ storytelling brains.  I can tell a story about that time we delved into the Mines of Moria and barely escaped with our lives just like I can tell a story about the time that Dave Roberts stole second, David Ortiz hit a single and suddenly it was a ball game, and then a series.  None of the game mechanics help with story, and yet there’s a story.</p>
<p>All of this is just to say that there’s nothing inherent in OSR play that requires it to have any rules for combat, and it can be used to model very different kinds of situations.</p>

              <p>I think the idea of rules having a “magnetic” effect is accurate. I would like to believe the OSR rhetoric of “rules are to be avoided wherever possible”, and I’m sure it is true for some groups, but it doesn’t align with my experience in general. Most people seem to be actively interested in using the mechanics, or at least view them as signposts to what the game is about.<br>
However I’d point out that if you trace the design trend in OSR from D&amp;D4e -&gt; Labyrinth Lord -&gt; LotFP -&gt; Into the Odd &amp; Knave, then you will see that the combat rules are getting smaller and smaller over time. It’s interesting that some people in this thread talk about ItO having “interesting combat mechanics” - they’re not wrong, but it seems the most interesting thing about it is that it lets you get the combat over with as quick as possible.<br>
The other thing is that adding mechanics to something that was previously handled by free conversation, can sometimes ruin it. A good example of this is D&amp;D4e’s skill challenges - they tried to add more rules for non-combat situations, but the result was that they reduced every such situation to a series of tedious die rolls and box-checking.<br>
All that said, I think there is a place for non-combat mechanics in OSR games, if it’s handled right. I am working on an OSR game inspired by stories like Spirited Away or Coraline, where the PCs are assumed to have no chance of fighting back against monsters. For that game I hope to develop subsystems for stealth, chases and negotiation. However it’s hard to strike a balance where the situation is mechanised in an interesting way, but there is still room for outside-the-box thinking.</p>

              <p>I find that games with differing mechanics, but the trappof OSR games can have better resolution systems for other types of activety than combat. For example, I run GURPS Dungeon Fantasy/DFRPG,  which has simple to complex systems for handling social, knowledge based, and non- combat physical skills in addition to the ubiquitous combat skills, all using a base mechanic.  Role playing through interactions grants a bonus to the dice,which are still used for arbitration.</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh absolutely!</p>
<p>You just touched on, I think, one of the things that I makes me a little sad when I read many OSR rule-sets: a lack of <em>good death mechanics</em>.  Specifically, many games, in trying to stay true to some little games that went before, have you drop dead at 0 HP (or maybe -2).  I think this misses all sorts of interesting ways to make death and serious injury more of a challenge that players can engage with.  For examples of interesting ways to build mechanics around this to make things less sudden and <em>final</em> (but still punishing) we can look at games like Into the Odd (now you are grinding down an ability score and rolling to avoid critical wounds) and the house rules proposed on the <a href="https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/id-hit-that/" rel="nofollow noopener">Last Gasp blog</a> (‘grit’ and ‘flesh’ points), or Dungeon World’s Last Breath move.</p>

              <p>A few years ago when I was thinking about how to apply the dungeon crawl paradigm (boiled down to something like the probably overly broad “a team of specialists navigating a dangerous environment in search of something valuable with an emphasis on resource management”) to other things than dungeons (haunted houses, burning buildings, Hell, someone’s dreams, etc), navigating a rocky relationship was one thing that struck my fancy. So at least there’s two of us who’s thought of that!</p>
<p>Going back to the more classic dungeon setting, you could also focus on the economic aspects. Equipment costs money, recovering from injuries from traps and falls costs money, hiring assistants costs money, and if the value of what you bring out doesn’t match what you’re paying you’ll be out of the game even if you’re not <em>dead</em> dead. (Darkest Dungeon has some of this, even if the emphasis there is much more on combat.)</p>
<p>Also, things can be plenty deadly without combat if you go heavily into traps.</p>

</aside>
<p>In the same way that combat is assumed by combat mechanics, I would say that life and death results are assumed by…life mechanics! Whatever the character’s gauge for function/nonfunctional is will be the metric by which we assume that character is assaulted. Sanity if Cthulhu games, Morale in war-themed games, timers for…time-base events, you get it.</p>
<p>We could make an OSR game about navigating the “labyrinth” of a relationship, with a meter tracking how strong the two character’s bond is, the assumption being that failure in challenges deals “damage” to their love. We must then narratively position “damaging” states as events in which the characters fail to communicate instead of them getting stabbed.</p>
<p>Getting my head out of the clouds, there are also plenty of pass/fail states for things other than a character’s life. Having equipment getting lost or destroyed. Failing to recover treasure. Getting maimed, cursed, or mutated. The simpler or more binary the life/death states are, the more implied freedom (and creative demand) you have to come up with rulings for everything that’s <em>not</em> life or death.</p>

              <p>Hmm that’s a cool question. It’s been a looong time since I played <em>Myst</em>, from what I remember you a basically exploring a location and solving puzzle to get to the other parts of the location?</p>
<p>I like that game but it’s also a solo experience, so if I sit there for 30 minutes noodling on a particular puzzle no one is going to get frustrated or bored. But if someone’s just sitting watching me think about a puzzle like that… well there just doesn’t seem to be enough at stake to make that interesting.</p>
<p>Questions of life and death are pretty compelling, if you take that out of an exploration game I’m not so sure where the tension is. You could say that in the <em>Myst</em> game the tension can be over <em>whether or not</em> they get to see that part of the location, but that seems wasteful. The nice thing about dungeon delving is you can assume the players will be able to make it to the bottom eventually, and the stakes question becomes <em>at what cost?</em></p>
<p>I probably just feel this way because I’m set in my ways. I’m sure there can be costs to adventuring other than the death of individuals… But I don’t really know what it looks like. There has to be some tension which keeps you from just careening from place other than the possibility of pit traps under the carpet.</p>

              <p>This seems to be exactly what already happened to “Old School” games. i.e. the games that OSR is based on not OSR games themselves. People noticed that RPG’s were dedicating all this space to combat and that was what the games ended up focusing on even though they might say they are about something else, and so we started getting story games and the types of games that grew out of the forge where the games were laser focused on providing rules for everything that the game was about.</p>
<p>The OSR came <em>after</em> all of that happened and from my perspective a lot of OSR was saying “Yes, old games did only have rules for combat but that’s good actually. That leaves the rest of the game space open for player creativity and gm judgement”. So from what I can tell we’ve already had the backlash and the evolution and modern OSR contains both games that take the stance I just mentioned and those that Paul_T describes and then there’s also things like Dungeon World which take the trappings of old school D&amp;D but in a more story game focus.</p>
<p>But maybe history will repeat itself and there will be a big movement within the OSR community that echoes the movement that occurred in the roleplaying community against those original old school game design styles. I haven’t totally followed it but maybe there’s an element of this in the Sword Dream movement?</p>

<p>It’s nevertheless true that the “magnetic” effect of rules-in-existence is strong.

<p>I like your suggestion or implication that we might see an even further evolution of OSR-style play away from D&amp;D’s wargame roots, and that could be an interesting thing to see. Would someone make a game that’s more like the computer game <em>Myst</em> in style, for instance, despite coming from an OSR background or aesthetic? Why not?</p>

There’s an interesting kind of dichotomy to me.  We say “try to avoid fights because you’ll probably die” and also “here are some special and fun mechanics for fighting”.  I guess I just find it weird that this seems so <em>prevalent</em>; are we going to see a backlash or evolution of this sort of design do you think?</p>

              <p>OSR is <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/five-hard-questions-about-osr-play/122">many</a> <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/whats-your-osr/1581">things</a> to <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/pixel-bashing-and-osr-style-play/382">many</a> people. One view would be that OSR is about dangerous dungeon exploration which is combat heavy. In this case you wouldn’t need other systems. Another would be that it’s about in-system combat mechanics and in-real-life out of box thinking and problem solving. Again - little need for non-combat systems.</p>
<p>There are probably other interpretations what would essentially boil down to “no need”. But personally it always irked me that some retro systems have attributes with little mechanics supporting them. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> So I see where you’re coming from. But at the same time I’m not sure I would want OSR system to be heavy on a political drama. I mean, sure, why not, but that would go beyond my definition of OSR which, again, once again boils down to “what’s OSR” and there’s no single answer to that.</p>
