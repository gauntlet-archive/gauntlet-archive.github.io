    <description>[The Golden Cobra Challenge](http://www.goldencobra.org/) is live and wow is this year exciting!

* Interesting award categories, including a distributed/synchronous one that may appeal to Gauntleteers who live and play in the online space anyway.
* Goofy optional ingredients, including a cardboard box and fighting Fascism.
* For the first time ever there is a guest judge, and it is a really great one. 

I&#39;m on the committee (not a judge this year) and would be glad to answer questions.</description>
