In his youth, Grandfather Oshregaal was a mighty biomancer and sorceror-king. He created new species and forged an empire. But now he has retired from politics, left his empire to his synthetic children, and retreated to his mansion in a deep cavern. He wants nothing more than to sit and drink and make merry. In the darkness of a cavern, he throws feasts every night. He has grown old and fat and strange.

You (the player characters) have performed heroic feats that brought you to the attention of Oshregaal. He has invited you to dinner at his legendary manse. Others see this as an opportunity, and have offered to pay you handsomely if you can assassinate Oshregaal, or destroy the accursed tree that sustains his empire&#39;s armies. And then, of course, there are the many legends about the treasures magical and mundane that Grandfather keeps within his house...

**The Meal of Oshregaal** is a short adventure by Arnold K. (author of Goblin Punch and the GLOG). It is partway between a social adventure and a dungeon crawl.

**Into the Odd** is a rules-light fantasy system by Chris McDowall. Rules will be taught as we go along.

We will use Google Meet for our sessions and Google Sheets (or possibly Google Slides) for character sheets. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools. 

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
