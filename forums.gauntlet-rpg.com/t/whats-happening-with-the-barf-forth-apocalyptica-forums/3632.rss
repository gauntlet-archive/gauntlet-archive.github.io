    <description>It seems that the &#39;barf forth apocalyptica&#39; forums, over at...

http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/

...have been down for quite some time now. There&#39;s a lot of really valuable information on those forums, including advice, actual plays, optional rules, and links to various hacks.

Does anyone know what&#39;s happening with those forums, and whether they are down for good? Has anyone heard anything?</description>

    This is a tool I put together for Apocalypse World; it can help a group get to the “action” very quickly. Taking the premise that the central conceit of each playbook + PC-NPC-PC triangles basically make the game work, this gives you a small set of NPCs with actionable and interesting relationships to the PCs. The players get to define who the NPCs are and why they are important to them, which means the MC just needs to “put flesh on that skeleton” with evocative character descriptions/depiction…

<p>I have a whole backlog of old lumpley games to play and test, so this is sometimes on my mind. Recently I finally ran Freebooting Venus, for example, and we had a great time.</p>

<p>They aren’t down as a matter of policy or anything, just technical difficulties. They’re waiting for me to have the spare day or two it’ll require for me to investigate and fix them.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking!</p>
