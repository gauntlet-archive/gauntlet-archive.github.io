              <p>Awesome stuff!</p>
<p>9 Original and 45 New.</p>
<p>So for a 6 Threat Arc for a season or campaign, that’s 9 campaigns worth.</p>
<p>But the cool thing there is variety in the original and new, some are murder mysteries, some are Stop X from doing Y.</p>
<p>Thus you can thread the different types of Threats to give your campaign a theme, Homicide Detectives vs Guardians of the Realm vs Body Parts R Us.</p>
<p>I feel like one of use released Keep on the Borderlands and then the rest of us homebrewed the rest of the World Setting, so cool <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
