    <title>Final(ish) Version of Shepherds now on Itch</title>

    <description>Disclaimer: I hope this is ok. I&#39;ve been working on this game for quite a while and have gotten help with several things from members of the community here, so I hope it&#39;s alright if I post an &quot;ad&quot;. If not, please mod away.

I&#39;ve finally &quot;completed&quot; work on my JRPG-inspired, hopefuly-fantasy PbtA game, [Shepherds](https://airkseablade.itch.io/shepherds).  I say &quot;completed&quot; since there&#39;s always room for typo correcting, and more art might come down the pipeline at some point, but the game is feature complete -- layout is done, both &quot;fancy&quot; layout and simple, big-text, single-column stuff for mobile/accessible reading.  PDF bookmarks are in, hyperlinks, etc.

So if you&#39;ve ever wanted to play a young member of an organization of professional do-gooders, heading out to a community in need to do everything from finding lost pets to foiling the plots of international criminal syndicates, this might be a game for you!  Selling points include:

* Seven background &quot;stories&quot; that capture JRPG archetypes and guide your character&#39;s growth while helping you define an &#39;issue&#39; that troubles them
* Trust system that encourages punctuating action and problem-solving with quiet interpersonal scenes
* A Move for making Friendship Speeches. 

I&#39;ve set a $5 price point because I want to encourage the idea that RPGs, even &#39;amateur&#39; ones, have some value, and to try to avoid undercutting people who do this for a living, but there are community copies available, and if those run out, I&#39;d be happy to give out a download code to anyone who thinks they&#39;ll actually put the game on the table.

Thanks again, everyone.</description>
