    <description>Inspired by slow fantasy worlds like those of Earthsea, Princess Mononoke, Mushi-shi and Sahdow of the Colossus, Ryne is a PbtA game about people holding things together in a world that is falling apart. 

Players wander emotional landscapes, discover the secrets of the Remnants, and inhabit communities whose customs and beliefs are shaped by the titans. Ryne is built around emotions - landscapes are shaped by feeling, places and landmarks have moods of their own. The stories your characters weave will be guided by their emotions, which take the place of skill and evolve over time as you play.

We&#39;re really proud of the work we&#39;ve done on Ryne - we&#39;d obviously love it if you&#39;d help us hit our funding goal, but we&#39;re equally excited to talk about it with other designers and enthusiasts. While we are broadly a pbta game, we genuinely think we&#39;ve done something exciting and different with Ryne, and how it plays!</description>
