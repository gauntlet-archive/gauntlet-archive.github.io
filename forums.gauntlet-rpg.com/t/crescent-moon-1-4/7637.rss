    <description>Crescent Moon ☾ is &quot;a feelings-delving role-playing game of brave children and bold adventures&quot;. It&#39;s based on the Forged in the Dark system but is a mostly non-violent game about collecting memories and piecing together the story of the patchwork dream world that you find yourselves journeying through. It&#39;s sweet and sad and whimsical. You can learn more about the game from it&#39;s [itch page](https://stardrift-design.itch.io/crescentmoon).

This will be my first time running the game. You don&#39;t need to know the rules, everything will be taught in play. There will be 4 sessions in Feb in total. The first session will be like a session zero and then three sessions of play. You must RSVP to all sessions you&#39;d like to attend.

We&#39;ll be playing over Streamyard but the game won&#39;t be recorded. We&#39;ll be using Lines &amp; Veils, the X Card and Open Table as safety tools. And the game will follow the Gauntlet Code of Conduct.
