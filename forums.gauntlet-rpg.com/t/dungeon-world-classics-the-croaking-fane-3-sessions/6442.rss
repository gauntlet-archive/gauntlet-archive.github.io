*For as long as men remember, the Lord of Evil Amphibians carried out unspeakable rites in his squatting temples situated far from civilization. Tales of human sacrifice, squirming servants, and rich but loathsome treasures were whispered of his followers. Now, unexpectedly, his servants have seemingly vanished, leaving behind their fanes to molder in the marshes. A brave band of adventurers gathers to explore one such tabernacle, eager to discover what riches—and terrors—the Lord of Evil Amphibians has left behind…*

Dungeon World Classics: The Croaking Fane is a DW conversion of the eponymous DCC module.

**Adventure Pitch:**  Men and women from a nearby village have been disappearing concurrently with the rise of a batrachian cult located in the swamps. Will you investigate and try to put a stop to the evil within or will you try to seize the available power for yourself?

**Venue:**  Discord. Video is not required but highly encourage. I GM better if I can see your faces and get visual feedback of how the story is going!

**CW:**  PG-13-level fantasy adventure. Evil Cultists. Murderous monsters. Immoral Rites. Mind control. Kidnapping. Religious abuse. Undead.

**System:**  Dungeon World, a Powered By The Apocalypse game.

**Duration:**  Three 4-hour play sessions followed by Stars and Wishes for those who can stay longer.

**Breaks:**  3 breaks at the top of each hour (5-10 minutes)

**Recording:**  None

**Attendance:**  Three sessions. Please only sign up if you can attend all three.

**Prior experience required:**  None, rules will be taught in play.
