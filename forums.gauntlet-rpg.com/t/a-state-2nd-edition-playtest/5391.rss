    <description>**This is a single-session playtest of the 2nd edition of an game, so expect a little roughness in the mechanics, pacing etc. - experience with a Forged in the Dark game required.**

&gt; You will never forget the City, but the City will forget you.

**a|state**
a|state is set in The City. Isolated from the outside world, it is a place riven by horrors, plagued by inhumanity and crushed under the weight of its own population. Rotting concrete towerblocks and dank brick tenements house the millions who work, live and die in The City. Ghostfighters, Scops, Lostfinders and Flowghosts make their way along the winding streets and stinking canals. a|state is about hope in a dark place. It is about characters who bring hope to themselves, their families, their friends, even to the whole city.

**Nicely, Done.**
Reports of child slavery in Mire End have led the group to investigate a woman named Hosanna Nicely. Nicely makes her home in a tenement on the turf of the terrifying Hohler Gang. 

I&#39;m saving a seat for Horst Wurst.
