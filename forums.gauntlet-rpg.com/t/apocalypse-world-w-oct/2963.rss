This is for five October Wednesday evening sessions of Apocalypse World, the original PbtA game. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged, but not required. Rules will be taught. In session one we will discuss tone, create characters, and get our story started. Content warning: AW can deal with violence, mature themes, and sex.

*Note: You will notice I only have two places open for this. The other two are held as make-ups for sessions I had to cancel earlier in the year*

**Something&#39;s wrong with the world and I don&#39;t know what it is.**
*It used to be better, of course it did. In the golden age of legend, when there was enough to eat and enough hope, when there was one nation under god and people could lift their eyes and see beyond the horizon, beyond the day. Children were born happy and grew up rich.*

*Now that&#39;s not what we&#39;ve got. Now we&#39;ve got *this* . Hardholders stand against the screaming elements and all comers, keeping safe as many as they can. Angels and savvyheads run constant battle against *there&#39;s not enough* and *bullets fly* and *everything breaks* . Hocuses gather people around them, and are they protectors, saviors, visionaries, or just wishful thinkers? Choppers, gunluggers and battlebabes carve out what they can and defend it with blood and bullets. Drivers search and scavenge, looking for that opportunity, that one perfect chance. Skinners and the Maestro D&#39; remember beauty, or invent beauty anew, cup it in their hands and whisper *come and see* , and don&#39;t worry now about what it will cost you. And brainers, oh, brainers see what none of the rest of us will: the world&#39;s psychic maelstrom, the terrible desperation and hate pressing in at the edge of all perception, it is the world now.*

*And you, who are you? This is what we&#39;ve *got* , yes. What are you going to *make* of it?*

We will use Zoom for the session. We will record the session and use the X-Card for safety. If you sign up and your attendance or RSVP changes, please also send me a message at edige23 at gmail. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) safety tool will be in use.
