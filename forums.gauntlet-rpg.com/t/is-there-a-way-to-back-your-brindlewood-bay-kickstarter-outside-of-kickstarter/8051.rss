    <description>Is there a way to back your Brindlewood Bay kickstarter outside of kickstarter? Because Kickstarter apparently needs a credit card (and credit card only) and I am from Europe - Germany specifically, and I do not own a credit card, do not need one in my day-to-day life and will not get one just for the kickstarter. I wanted to contact you via Email, but alas I could not find an email address anywhere on the homepage or at the kickstarter site.

Kind regards,
G.</description>
