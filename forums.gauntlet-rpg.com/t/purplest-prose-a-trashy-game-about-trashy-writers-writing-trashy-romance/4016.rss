This is for a one shot of [ *Purplest Prose: A Trashy Game About Trashy Writers Writing Trashy Romance* ](https://thedovetailor.itch.io/purplest-prose) by Pammu. Rules will be taught. In the session we’ll discuss tone, choose the game frame, and get to playing. This is a GMless game, so I’ll be playing and facilitating. We will use email as part of the collaborative submission process. Content warning: sexytimes. 

Our subtitle ought to say it all: this is a game about coming together to write the trashiest romance stories you can think of! Build a group of 3-5 players to keep things quick, dirty and fun. Develop a writer persona - complete with a trashy social media profile to introduce yourself with - and engage in some Cards Against the Humanity style gameplay as each one of you competes to make the best romance novel  *evar* .

Purplest Prose just needs two six-sided dice, index cards, tokens, things you can write with, about two hours for game time, and a great sense of humor.  **It&#39;s crunch time, honey!**

We will play using Zoom and record the session. We will use the X-Card as well as Lines &amp; Veils for safety. If you sign up and your attendance or RSVP changes, please also send me a message at edige23 at gmail. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. The session will last about 3 hours.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) safety tool will be in use.
