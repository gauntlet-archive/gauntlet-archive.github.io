**NOTE: Please only sign up if you&#39;re interested in playtesting!** [Our Haunt](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/our-haunt) is still in active development, and I will be using a different version of the published game.

We find ourselves in a home we don’t recognize. We don’t remember much of our previous lives. Images, sounds, some painfully crystal sharp flashes of memories that bear no beginning or end. Impressions of a life lived, almost as if someone else lived them. As we play, we may remember more, if we choose to. Or we may choose to focus on the present and create new memories.

We are ghosts, but we can’t remember how we died. We don’t remember how we came to this house, or if the house brought us here. We just know that this is where we haunt now. We can choose to solve this mystery, we may investigate or try to reach out to the Living, even if they fear us. Or we may choose to keep to ourselves, and make the most of what we have now, in our space. When the Living come, we may hide from them if we wish. Or we may scare them away, hoping they’ll never return.

There is something else in the house. Something ancient, inhuman. It scares us, but we don’t understand it. What does it want with us? What is it really?

No matter what we decide, as Ghosts we are here to learn how to build a home and care for each other, even if we can’t always understand each other.

**CW: supernatural horror, death, grief, memory loss, romance, personal tragedy.**

**System** : Belonging Outside Belonging, a token based system where everyone takes turns being the GM for a scene or shares the GM role. Rules will be taught in play.

**Duration**  : Three 3 hour sessions

**Breaks**  : 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : Yes, but only if all players consent to recording and publishing

**Attendance**  : Joining all sessions is ideal but not required **.**

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, an open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

**Open access** : Public signs up are available at 3/23/2021 10PM (Manila Time)
