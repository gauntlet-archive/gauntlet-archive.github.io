    <description>Welcome to a sun-drenched world full of dangerous creatures, jealous gods and weird Atlantean sorcery. 

*Defy the Gods*  is an ancient-world sword-and-sorcery adventure inspired by *Conan*, *Clash of the Titans* and *Princess Mononoke*. It’s also a GM-less story game that centers queer characters. The tone is basically serious with elements of dark fantasy. It will probably include world exploration and combat against people or creatures. Fend off the many forces that threaten the mortal world and seek your fortune. You can play a swordfighter, a scholar of Atlantean lore, a creature of the wilds, a mystic and more.

This is an early playtest. I can’t guarantee everything will work as intended, but I’m sure we’ll have a good time.
