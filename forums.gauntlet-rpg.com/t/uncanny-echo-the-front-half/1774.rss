    <title>Uncanny Echo (The Front Half)</title>

    <description>There&#39;s always been something not quite right about this city. Things you see out of the corner of your eye, conversations just out of earshot, a smell you can&#39;t place but that you swear you remember.

Uncanny Echo is a prestige TV series of modern urban weirdness. Think The Wire if it were written by Rod Serling. We&#39;ll play to find out what&#39;s so strange about this place, in a series of one-shots that will tie together in ways we haven&#39;t figured out yet. 

Sign up for one or more, as you wish, each is a self-contained one-shot that happens in the same setting over time, but aren&#39;t directly tied by a tight continuity.  The entire series runs 10 episodes, with the back half planned for July. 

CW: Modern hard-boiled strangeness. Prepare to play a range of genres from crime to edgy sitcom, with a range of characters. Presume sex, drugs, and violence at a premium streaming drama level. 

X-Card will be in effect, with Open Door Policy and Lines and Veils . Sessions will be recorded but only posted with affirmative consent from all participants at the end of the session.
