    <description>Hi everyone! Just discovered this community and am really excited to start digging in. I did not see a thread for new users to introduce themselves, so I figured I&#39;d start it up.

So hi there, my name is Adam. I am 28 years old, been playing ttrpgs since high school, but in the past 5 years I&#39;ve started exploring things beyond DnD/Pathfinder. It&#39;s been a wandering journey trying to find a good community, but it looks like I&#39;ve hit paydirt. If you&#39;ll allow me to be a little selfish, I&#39;m getting more serious about designing ttrpgs and looking to network and find playtesters. I really enjoy games with novel mechanics/settings, I hope we can have some great discussions about game design, and I hope those interested will find my games as exciting as I find them!</description>

              <p>Hi everyone!<br>
I’m Michele (he/him) from Italy. I’ve known The Gauntlet for some time through its wonderful podcasts and publishing (“do you know why they call me Weary?..”), although I’ve only recently broken the ice with an incredible game of Trophy Dark. So I hope to join more games (if Time Zone and schedule permit), or have the opportunity to help play test or contribute to the community in any way <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Thank you all for being a great anchor in the indie TTRPG sea!</p>

              <p>Hello, Alun<br>
Some of my TTRPG crew and I have been playing a game of Ars Magica (5th ed.) set in the Wirral circa 900AD.  We find that we prefer PbtA-type rules (Dungeon World, Stonetop, etc.). I heard mention of your Eotenweard on the Gauntlet podcast and looked it up. We have watched your actual plays here in the forums and we are excited by what we saw.<br>
Are you going to release Eotenweard any time soon?<br>
If not, is there a way we could get a beta-test copy with which to play?  We would be happy to buy such an item, and/or provide playtest commentary and suggestions to you.<br>
We’ve all been playing all sorts of RPGs since the late 1970s, and our group is professionals (lawyer, high school principal, zoologist, a couple IT experts) who enjoy our escape pastime of gaming!<br>
Have a great day!</p>

              <p>Hi folks! I’m Aaron from Winnipeg (in Canada) and have decided to play more story games this year (instead of buy and wish I was playing). I love what The Gauntlet is doing both as a publisher and a community and I’m a huge fan of the podcasts (RIP +1 Forward) that so many of you contribute to. I’m hoping to sign up for a few games this quarter if my schedule allows for it. Would love to see more one shots on open calendar if anyone is feeling on the fence!</p>
<p>Thanks to each of you for what you do.</p>

<p>I discovered indie RPGs / story games in my twenties, and then OSR a few years later, and play both. I mostly run games for my friends, so I would love to have opportunities to play games run by other people, both because it would be fun, but also to be exposed to a more varied play culture and learn from how other’s GM.</p>
<p>I played yesterday in Chris Rugger’s Voidheist game as part of GCOG (I don’t know his username here or else I’d tag him in). It was a lot of fun, and I hope I will be able to play more soon.</p>

              <p>Hi, new here. I’m so happy to have found a place to talk about content creation for RPGs. I come from the boardgamegeek forums, especially the print and play game contest that run there. I’m just getting used to the site. It’s very slick! I want to thank Sen Foong Lim for pointing me towards this wonderful community.</p>
<p>I don’t play as much I would like to. Some session go on too long. Some rules are too complicated. I really just want the story and the fun. I play with my son, who is 8, and his friends, every week online. I run the session using a system I wrote… the simplest possible rules set I could write. I’m play testing that with them, and I would love to get some feedback on it from you guys. I will post more about it in the right place, but until then, here is the link <a href="https://ex1st.itch.io/eni" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ex1st.itch.io/eni</a></p>
<p>I’m 42, I think, from the UK/Spain, living in Japan for over 10 years. My timezone means I post at odd times. I usually edit my posts after posting them. Great to meet you all.</p>

              <p>Hey ya’ll!</p>
<p>My name is Gilbert, I’m 33 from San Jose, CA. I’m also a suburban dad who’s only recently gotten into RPG’s. I’m a systems engineer (and write way too much code for/around RPG’s).</p>
<p>Originally introduced to OSR’s by a good friend at a tech conference. My small local group of friends got started with 5E. Came across Fear of a Black Dragon and the list of modules and games to play has been growing.</p>
<p>Recently started playing Trophy Dark and I LOVE it. Playing Trophy Gold this weekend and I’m pretty stoked!</p>

              <p>Hi !<br>
My name is Tolkraft, i’m 40, French, and an RPG enthusiast for 8 years now.</p>
<p>I create and publish <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/18585/Dendrobat-Prod" rel="nofollow noopener">beautiful free MedFan adventures</a> under the label DendrobatProd.</p>
<p>I love MedFan and Cthulhu (mostly Delta Green), and I like to discover a lot of different games.</p>
<p>Among my feats of arms, I won the French Threeforged challenge twice in three years of attending, and several scenario contests.</p>
<p>I’m doing my best to produce high-quality content (I learnt how to write, layout and illustrate by myself and always try to improve), so I hope you’ll like what I do.</p>
<p>See ya!</p>

<p>I’ve been role playing for 25 years (dear god), and I’ve suddenly got an idea for an RPG. The first time I’m not just wanting to hack something else. I like a lot of games that have come out of the Gauntlet, so I thought I’d join up and say hi. I’m increasingly convinced half of writing a good RPG in 2021 is building a community, so hello!</p>
<p>I also garden and bake and play video games on easy mode.</p>
