    <description>I present to you the &lt;B&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2019/11/03/crowdfunding-collection-123/&quot;&gt;new Crowdfunding Collection #123, including every tabletop rpg project started between 10/30 and 11/03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/B&gt;.

Despite the last collection been just 4 days ago, you’ll find that there are 22 projects included in this. As for the next, it might get delayed for three weeks, or a bit more, since I will take a trip to The Night in Question – which effectively will take two weekends as I’ll again take a small US vacation.

First of all, I’d like to direct your attention towards the German translation of &lt;B&gt;Lovecraftesque&lt;/B&gt;. If you like to support the game line abroad, if you do speak German, take a look. The publisher is new, I do think reliable, and needs some more support.
In regards of English language projects, there’s the &lt;B&gt;Dark V01D Science Fiction&lt;/B&gt; ttrpg. A project from Germany that is presented and offered in English. The SF setting is visibly inspired by the 80s and the system developed of from The Dark Eye. Though the creator chose a more narrative approach with just keeping the combat practical. It should be worth having a look. Then there is &lt;B&gt;Mystic Lilies&lt;/B&gt;, a card based game, which focussed on the dramatic conflict among witches and dark arts. The author referes Monsterhearts, Touhou Project, Bayonetta and Madoka Magica as points of references. While I don’t consider Bayonetta as dramatic – imho it’s more like „Fucking stylish, in your FACE Fucker! BOW BOW BOW“-drama than eny of the other – I find my self really intruiged by the concept presented and recommend having a look. Then there’s &lt;B&gt;Moonpunk&lt;/B&gt;, a PbtA game, in which you play different kinds of punks rebelling on the moon. The game comes in the form of a punk-zine and does look interesting.
Then there are two Larps, &lt;B&gt;Hi-Ho!&lt;/B&gt; aims to offers a fun single-player Larp. Though going by the video it can be played with oneself and a quite literal socketpuppet. A nice, rather inexpensive, idea that might be worth having a look at. &lt;B&gt;System 7&lt;/B&gt; offers a sytem, from the looks card based, for Larps and ttrpgs, with the opportunity to simulate any genre from fantasy to vampires. Which does make it interesting.
Then you’ll find &lt;B&gt;Leopard Women of Venus&lt;/B&gt; for DCC among the settings. As the name indicates it revels in a Golden Age comic book approach and has women riding through space on dragon-crocodiles while shooting fire/lasers from their helmets. Which lookes like ridiculously absurd fun. Just take a look. I personally, for now, pledged for the &lt;B&gt;Super Blood Harvest&lt;/B&gt; adventure. It’s a collection of actually three modules, I guess setting up on a supposed OSR rule set, yet very stylish and with vampires. Well, and if I had a 3D printer I might have pledged for the very cool looking &lt;B&gt;Draconic Dice Crypts&lt;/B&gt; STL files.
There are many more interesting, cool and fun projects, just take a look:
