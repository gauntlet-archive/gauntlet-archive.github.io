              <p>If there has to be an advance system, instead of just playing one-shots or actually being good from the start and then change the values, I prefer to “ding” at the end of a session. This demands that there is a clear end goal in sight every session or that you can finish an adventure (or subadventure) every second or third session.</p>

              <p>I haven’t played them but I am fascinated by the Uncanny Echoes and Lady Blackbird use of keys to level up in a one-shot that also drives the story forward.</p>
<p>I enjoyed how collateral damage reduced your XP in the old Marvel Supers FASERIP game. any game that allows the use of XP to improve your homebase or your mission status. (FASERIP,  Stonetop village upgrades, Comrades - revolution track,  Ironsworn system of completing Oaths )<br>
Wolf-packs and Winter Snow build your clan up.</p>
<p>I like getting XP for resolving bonds in Dungeon World.</p>
<p>Do:  Pilgrims of the Flying Temple system is simple, narrative, and genius.</p>
<p>Apparently, I most love XP systems that build up the shared world elements or storylines the most.</p>

<p>If you mean “Once you use a Spiritual Attribute, it becomes a currency that you can use to improve your character.” that’s not quite right.</p>
<p>What I mean is that you can keep the SA points you’ve accrued, to be used over and over again in limited situations, or you can spend them, immediately, to raise certain scores. IIRC, most skills were use-based like CoC, but attributes and combat skills could be raised by permanently spending accrued SA points - usually at a very disadvantageous exchange rate so like…5 SA points for 1 fighting skill point, etc.</p>
<p>At no point do SAs go into a “pot” of XP to be spent later.</p>

<p>If memory serves, you defined things that were important to you, let say: Kill Humperdinck and Marry Buttercup. When you did things to advance those agendas, you coul earn points in them.</p>
<p>Here’s the part that’s just so killer: while you have points in those SAs, you can add them to your pools while <em>pursuing</em> those agendas, which can make a huge difference when you’re trying to kill Humperdinck so you can marry Buttercup - you can have huge pools representing your spiritual and emotional dedication to the task at hand. <strong>But</strong> - you only advance by <em>spending</em> those points, which turns advancement / XP into a meaningful decision - not just a thing that passively <em>happens to you</em>.</p>

              <p>There was a discussion somewhere recently, maybe on Story Games, about how to encourage players to take “non-optimal” (i.e., something other than the tactically expedient) actions. The nice thing about rewarding alignment behavior directly is that it does this by influencing the player’s calculations about the best course of action. So for example,  when the Lawful Good dwarven monk saw the NPC pirate king making one of his own bullywug pirate crew don a potentially dangerous magical artifact, even though it would have been more expedient to continue to watch from hiding, he felt obligated because of his alignment to intercede. Of course, other players can potentially interpret something you intended one way a different way, but that encourages players to frame what they’re doing in terms of character motives.</p>

You’re right; it would totally work with D&amp;D Traits etc., just add them as a category of thing that you can get “experience checks” for. I mention ideals briefly in the write-up, but my players haven’t really noticed and I haven’t pushed it. The next time we play, I think it’ll be worth paying attention to.</p>

I can see a pregenerated list of level worthy accomplishments handed to the players at the start of the game, but that seems like a lot of setting by setting work.</p>
<p>Also with this explanation it sounds like there’s 5 XP points to gain a level - still a point system, but a very loose one - again, I’d just fret about tracking and deciding when and what counts.</p>

              <p>Black Hack codifies it by specifying a list of example “experiences” and the last one on the list is “the GM deems it worthy”. You also need more each level, and there’s a related carousing table.</p>
<p>The leveling does not depend upon any kind of IRL performance quality, it’s just a dash of sugar.</p>
<p>In my personal hack, it is absolutely the “meh” version because it’s meant to be pulpier and more casual than TBH2e. I don’t have much free time so I tend to hack things within an inch of their life so that they are slender enough to fit into mine. Anyway, you still need to get back to the tavern to spend them, and can’t hold more than 5.</p>

              <p>How does this work mechanically though?  I can see this as five adventures or five encounters (please no not encounter based design!) for a decent player - and we should all have decent players, but I can also see jerk abusing it.  That’s not important though…can’t write games for jerks.</p>
<p>What I do wonder about is the way that this appears to center player verbal virtuosity as a mechanic.  Are you good at what is effectively as an “actual play” write up? 'Cause that’s how you level.  Seems like it favors a type of player - the gregarious extroverted and inventive kind over others (fine for me and my table which is largely professional bullshit artists) A player who can make a good story out of whatever levels fast. Plus this also seems like a lot of play time devoted to listening to players talk about their character.  Really though I wonder about it because it sounds like a cutesy way of doing milestone XP (that is leveling when the GM decides you’ve completed pre-determined goals - which is fine for some games) with an added bit of room for players to petition the GM.  I don’t know, I’m a cranky grognard type, but it feels opaque to the player, time consuming, and highly subjective.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear how this works for people?  I can see it working with a close knit group that’s got a lot of space for blarney and no reserved members - but I’d fear it’s a harsh arena of verbs and favoritism for a lot of groups.</p>
<p>Alternatively you level every five failed rolls - which well seems… meh.</p>

              <p>Just cause this thread necro’d I’ll add that I’m a big XP=GP (recovered from mythical underworld or wilderness - including bounties and rewards) fan.  I know this is predictable, but to me the transparency of the mechanic (meaning it allows players schemes without GM buy in or planning), the moral flexibility of both using and obtaining wealth (placing moral play decisions into play) and the way it fits well with exploration and discovery all really win me over.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s not going to work for a lot of settings or even systems - superheros for example would be strange, but even a fantasy system less about exploration might be a reach.  For example a sort of Tang detective fantasy thing (Judge Dee via troupe play meets CoC) wouldn’t make sense if wealth recovery were the advancement mechanic.</p>
<p>For anything low fantasy, Western or post-apocalyptic though I find XP=GP very useful.</p>

<p>Though I find the questionnaire approach simple and elegant, my players and I are sometimes frustrated that the questions nudge us toward a certain style of play and storytelling. We want to tell our stories and still have the opportunities to advance.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing a lot of <strong>Coriolis</strong> and find that system incredibly frustrating, as even when the character gets an advance, there’s not much to add. Adding talents or skills seems to fly in the face of the fiction, so also rubs me the wrong way.</p>
<p>The systems that seem to work best with my tables are those where there are skills that go through a natural progression. Unlocking new moves or more expert versions of the skill fit well enough with the fiction. I keep coming back to Fantasy Flight’s <strong>Star Wars</strong> games, where you use to buy upgraded skills and powers, or bump stats. It’s pretty “brute force” but puts the incentives in the right place.</p>
<p>The most intriguing mechanic I’ve seen recently (though haven’t played with) is in <strong>Comrades</strong>, where individual characters can advance, but mostly the advancement happens at the “crew” level. (I’d imagine <strong>Legacy</strong> and <strong>Blades</strong> might have something similar…?) In Comrades, as the characters contribute to the revolutionary cause, they can advance the group along five different tracks, affording them different advantages and narrative opportunities.</p>

<p>I personally dig the skill advancement system in BW since it is entirely linked to your actually getting better at the things you actually do in play. It drives you to put your skills (whatever those may be (including accounting)) into the service of pushing for your beliefs. I think it can lead to situations and character evolutions no one would have expected at the start of a campaign.</p>

But I think it’s not unreasonable to adopt some more qualitative approach to advancement, along the lines of “note what skills you used and why, show how the reasons are connected to your Beliefs, Instincts, and Traits, and then when you’ve done that, go ahead and advance the skill–or go ahead and roll to advance.” Something like that.</p>

              <p>I like this. Reflecting on character actions at the end of the session would be my favorite system.</p>
<p>Burning Wheel does something like this, but for “Artha,” a resource that can be spent to reroll or otherwise influence rolls at crucial moments. At the end of every session, you look at your stated goals, instincts and traits, talk about how those affected your play, look at whether or not any of them should be changed, and award artha accordingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, advancement in BW is handled by accumulating Routine, Difficult and Challening skill checks, a designation that changes based on your skill rating, and a different number of which are required based on your skill rating. It’s fiddly af and one of my least favorite parts of the system. I’d love to be able to handle advances of skills in a similar way to Artha — talk at the end of the session about how a player used skills towards their goals and nominate certain skills for advancement or XP.</p>
