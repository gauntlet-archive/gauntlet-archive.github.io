    <title>Chronicle Series</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/chronicle-series/6513</link>
    <description>This is linked series of four storygames Thursday evenings in April (US Eastern). Attendance at all sessions is **strongly encouraged** as material from one game will shape the world of the next.

This series will begin with a session of *Microscope*, building a shared fantasy world. The second session will be *Arcana Innominata*. In this game we will sketch out what a tarot-like card deck looks like within the world we created in session one. We will in parallel tell the story of a quest within our world. Finally it will end with two sessions of *Kingdom 2e*. I will put together a setting based on ideas developed in the first couple of sessions.

In each session we will go through the setup, establish tone, and go over our safety tools before we play. We will be using Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door Policy. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in effect. I will send out a set up email with a link to the Zoom sessions about a week beforehand. If you sign up and your availability changes, please drop from the event listing and give me a heads up.
