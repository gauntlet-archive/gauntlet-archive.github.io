    <title>Muster - a new old school primer</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/muster-a-new-old-school-primer/6188</link>
    <description>Many of us who were active at Story Games spent hours - and pages - interrogating Eero Tuovinen about his practice of &quot;challenge-based&quot; wargame-style old-school play. There were wonderful and insightful discussions, which, unfortunately, were all lost when the forum shut down.

Well, great news! Eero is back at work publishing an actual &quot;primer&quot; covering this kind of play. It&#39;s both theory and praxis. 

His perspective here is well developed, unique to his particular approach to this style of gaming, and based on years of actual play. (Basic D&amp;D, homebrew, and Braunstein.) 

It&#39;s a slightly different take from what I often see in the OSR sphere, more concerned with the theory behind the decisions you make in design and play: in other words, if he&#39;s successful, his booklet will teach you *how* to make those decisions based on a sort of agenda and principles. You can get a good sense of how he presents information from his blurb on the page linked below.

I figure there is enough &quot;old school&quot; interest and curiosity here at the Gauntlet - as well as people derived from a Forge background, who would know Eero from there - that it&#39;s worth letting you all know about it. It might be of interest to at least a handful of people here.

I highly recommend you to check it out, to see what all the hype was all about. He&#39;s looking to fund it here, at IndieGoGo, over the next two weeks or so:

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/muster-an-old-school-primer#/

Help spread the word, too - it&#39;s just word of mouth at this point, and I&#39;m sure you have friends or contacts who would really enjoy this product.</description>

<p>Muster should be interesting, and I’m curious to see how it matchess with my own ideas about classic play, Eero’s principles are certainly inspiring and I’m exciting about the project.</p>

<p>This is shaping up to be a thorough treatment and the “playing well” section alone will be well worth it, though “decision-making filtering with dice” and “controlling complexity, maintaining data” also sound intriguing. Eero’s got a knack for simple, yet powerful procedures (e.g. intuitively creating and easily maintaining encounter tables via nested tables etc., as I well remember from Story-Games).</p>
<p><strong>Funding is at 75%</strong> but has slowed down, so listen to the commando skirkmish operator in you and charge over there. Victory is within our grasp!</p>

<p>I used to collect some of Eero’s (and others’) insights from those discussions at my blog back in 2015, for example <a href="http://outforblood1.blogspot.com/2014/05/eero-tuovinen-is-my-hero-part-ii.html" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a favorite from Eero, wherein he has the following to say about “optimizing at the expense of a robust and compelling fiction”, e.g. by “<strong>swinging some sort of a pole-marmoset-flint knife combo platter in a customized effort to keep my character safe</strong>”:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Eero">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Eero:</div>
<blockquote>
<p> [T]o me <strong>the ideal of beautiful and powerful play</strong> in an organically developing Gamist game with heavy focus on positioning, such as this style of D&amp;D, is to grasp with determination at a subject matter and challenge proposition that you find compelling; the question is not whether you could win at a GM’s obstacle course by stacking rules and positioning to your favour, the question is whether you can triumph against <strong>a challenge chosen and internalized by yourself</strong> within <strong>the fictional constraints, partially unspoken, that determine whether your play is petty or compelling</strong> . Not whether you can build a knight that can slay a dragon, but <strong>whether <em>a knight</em> as per your understanding of knighthood can slay a dragon</strong> .</p>

<p>I’m totally stoked about his crowdfunding project!</p>
