    <title>Zoom Update for May</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/zoom-update-for-may/5209</link>
    <description>If you&#39;re using Zoom for your online sessions, be aware that they&#39;ve released a major 5.X update this week. This adds more security features. However it does create lag and video issues if for players who are running the app and have not updated it yet. The problem seems to come from multiple versions in the same call. If you&#39;re having issues, check your updates status. In the app on the landing page (before entering a meeting) you can click on your icon in the upper right. This will pop up a menu. Select &quot;Check for Updates&quot;.</description>
