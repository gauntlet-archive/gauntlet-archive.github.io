    <description>**July One-Shots**: The Final Girl

**When**:  Thursday 7/1/2021, 8:00 PM EDT

**Sessions**: 1

**Players**: 4 (including the facilitator)

**Content Warnings**: Graphic violence, death,  possibly other themes that will be hashed out during game set-up.

----
*The Final Girl* is a GM-less horror movie role-playing game meant to emulate slasher flicks or other horror movies where the characters are picked off one-by-one until only one survivor remains to confront the killer. We will create our own movie and find out who will survive to see the end credits.

----
**Technology**:  The GM&#39;s Zoom for video chat, Google Sheets for the character keeper, and playingcards.io for a shared virtual card table. 
**Safety Tools**: X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door
**RSVP Open Access**: 6/22/2021, 8:00 PM EDT
**Recording**:  If all participants consent, the session will be recorded and video (or audio-only if preferred) will be uploaded to YouTube.
**Experience Required**: None. All rules will be taught at the table.
