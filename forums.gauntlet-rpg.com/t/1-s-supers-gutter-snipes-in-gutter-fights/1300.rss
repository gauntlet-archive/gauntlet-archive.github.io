    <description>    1%&#39;s  Supers  
                                       Gutter Snipes in Gutter Fights

 I will be running 4 sessions on Tuesdays in May at 2:30 pm Eastern. This is a play test of 1%&#39;s Supers by Rich Rogers. It will be for 3 players and last 3 hours. We will do a little feedback after each session.

   In South GC things are tough. The big heroes watch out for the North Side millionaires, the Downtown Corps, and the Upper Crust of Gauntlet City. The South-G needs a different sort of hero, and you are that sort. Honestly, you&#39;re pretty much any sort....and you&#39;re all the South-G has. 

  This will be a gritty, street level Supers game. We will discuss tone, do lines and veils, and have the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy in effect. We will also have the X-Card on the table. It will be recorded for future post with player approval.
