**WRESTLE ALL THE THINGS! CONQUER ALL THE ARENAS! SEIZE THE GAUNTLET!**

Gauntlet League Wrestling! After a season of changes, management goes on the road to test out new talent.

This *World Wide Wrestling* session will have quick character set up followed by everyone fighting for the prize-- a contract with the promotion. A curated set of playbooks will be available. Feel free to recreate past characters. No experience necessary with pro wrestling or the rules, everything will be taught in a friendly environment.

If you’ve been curious about World Wide Wrestling, come in and try it out. It’s fun and furious for any and all. Your Creative’s a relative newb to Pro-Wrestling so we’ll all advance together.

Move lists and playbooks will be posted ahead of time. Content Warning: Some wrestling gimmicks and storylines can hit on problematic areas. We will discuss tone and use the X-Card for safety.

The session will last 3-4 hours. We will be using Zoom for the meeting and recording the session. IF YOU SIGN UP, PLEASE ADD THIS TO YOUR CALENDAR. LET’S GET IT ON!!!
