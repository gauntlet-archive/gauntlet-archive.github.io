    <description>*This one-shot is part of a celebration of 4 years of the Star Wars Saturday games series, brought to you by members of the Gauntlet RPG Community.*

*The air screams around your helmet as your hurtle past the final turn and towards the finish line. Your best friend looks to make a pass that could take both of you out. Do you play it safe and risk losing, or play for glory and risk everything?*

Podracing was outlawed by the New Republic due to its dangerous nature. Despite this, the sport was still practiced on certain remote worlds such as Batuu and Tatooine, and with illegal transmissions of the races and a vigorous betting scene it&#39;s one of the highest profile criminal activities in the galaxy.

[Superstars: Racing Icons](https://feelingfickle.itch.io/superstars-racing-icons) is a Firebrands game and is by Britt A Willis and Pete Volk.
