    <description>This is a long shot but I thought I&#39;d ask - I found on itch.io some time ago a series of three Trophy Dark Incursions that took place in the post-WWII cold war period. I made the mistake of not buying them at the time and now I can&#39;t find them. 

Does anyone else know what I&#39;m on about?

              <p>Okay, it wasn’t a fever dream. It’s just user error on <a href="http://itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">itch.io</a>’s search function. The games come from Monkey’s Paw Games and are titled “The Flash” and “3/10/1956”</p>
