    <description>So you know the PbtA thing that playbook extras are restricted to those playbooks? Frex, a Battlebabe can&#39;t gain a hardhold, even if they fictionally get one, until they switch playbooks. What if there&#39;s a game where every &quot;extra&quot; is treated like a compendium class from Dungeon World? That way, if something happens fictionally that you didn&#39;t expect from that character, you wouldn&#39;t be forced to wait until your 6th advance.</description>

<p>So if a player acquired control of the hardhold I (as the MC) might give them a custom (usually worse) version of the hardholder move immediately. They have the ability to acquire the move (via advances) if they want to get a “better” version of the move.</p>

              <p>In my experience, this usually happens a couple different ways (as example):</p>
<ol>
<li>The player obtains a hold, then waits until their next level-up to take a move from the Hardholder’s playbook. Which makes sense in narrative since the character doesn’t really know what they’re doing yet, so will flail and fail for a bit until they have a chance to figure it out.</li>
<li>Alternately, the player can signal to the MC, out of game or by taking the move, that this is something they’re interested in seeing in play. Goal Posting for the GM.</li>
</ol>
<p>In one of our AW games, we didn’t have a Hardholder. Players and NPCs kept coming to our Savvyhead for help for all manner of problems. The player decided to take a Hardholder move to help deal with this de facto leadership position they were, reluctantly, forced into.</p>

              <p>Right, a Battlebabe could take a move from the Hardholder, but they would ostensibly have nothing to apply the move to since a Battlebabe does not have a hardhold (only Hardholders get that).<br>
I’ve always presumed that if a character gets a move from another playbook that presumes the character has something, then they have it. But there’s really not anything that says that…except that character advancement can be descriptive — if the Battlebabe builds a fort, perhaps that character should just get the move regardless of Hx.</p>
<p>Sorry if “Hardholder” is not the playbook, but I cannot be pressed to look up the proper name now lol</p>
