    <title>Blades in the Dark: A Modern Setting?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/blades-in-the-dark-a-modern-setting/3215</link>
    <description>As our Locke Lamorra infused game of Blades in the Dark begins to reach a natural end point, we&#39;re looking for what to do next.

In part due to _Leverage_, as well as the nuance and degree of cultural touchstones, we&#39;re thinking about a modern Blades in the Dark Game. 

I&#39;d likely run it -- it&#39;s been a while and is more or less my turn -- and I&#39;m concerned about two things:
1. Politics. The central tag of Leverage is: The rich and powerful take what they want. We steal it back for you. Sometimes bad guys make the best good guys. We provide... [Leverage]

And, well, there&#39;s a fascist sitting in the Oval and it&#39;d be my natural instinct for the game to head in the direction of, say, stealing back an election. I don&#39;t want it to, as that&#39;s too serious to be fun.

How do I avoid it?

2. System changes. Blades has ghost spirits and spirit bombs and whatever else. Our world ... seemingly does not. What, if any, changes do I need to make to Blades for it to work in a modern setting?

What do you think?</description>

<p>I don’t think its too much. I’ve got an email draft (yeah, i know that’s not ideal) filled with a few paragraphs, including what I need for a crew sheet.</p>
<p>This includes changes to coin, stash, and what it is to take a claim. As for this endeavor, I am fundamentally not interested in turning people into vassals, and money isn’t important.</p>
<p>Instead, favors and stash becomes how well you operate as a citizen. The ghost related complications becomes citizenry related. I think Attune becomes something like “Blend”, namely being about blending in and passing as a citizen. But, that then overlaps with how I want to use Stash levels, so maybe not.</p>
<p>Anyway. Work in progress. I think/hope it’ll remain straightforward.</p>

<p>I’d also check out Magpie’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marktruman/cartel-a-mexican-narcofiction-tabletop-roleplaying" rel="nofollow noopener">Cartel</a>, which has less strict territory-control and doesn’t use jobs in the same way, but treads familiar ground otherwise.</p>
<p>That said, a really dense, urban-focused Blades hack set in the modern day could definitely work.</p>

<li>Tier is not about size. It’s about teamwork. Size is one of the variables (like potency or whatever), but the primary thing is <em>teamwork</em>
</li>
<li>Instead of coin, favor. A hundred grand isn’t important to these people – they have an alternative revenue source. But what does matter is favors.</li>
<li>Weird chemistry mostly works in place of alchemy and such: We don’t need ghosts if we can fake it with chemistry.</li>
<li>To avoid the politics: Questions related to The Case, ostensiably on each sheet. Everybody asks a question, and someone else answers it. This tells us everything we need to know – like who is ripping off The Client – and as that won’t be the flimflam man in the Oval, then we can deal with a different thief this week.</li>
</ol>
<p>That should help with many of the issues I’m having, and only the most recent one is hard.</p>
<p>Whatcha think?</p>

              <p>Agreed, and that was part of why a first try at Blades didn’t work. Though, it was an early playtest so I’ve always blamed that.</p>
<p>I think there are some turf wars in Leverage, but those are at a very different level than in Blades.They get attacked a time or two, and have to fight back against similarly powerful foes. But: That is rare and not the central part of the show.</p>
<p>Blades seems so close to what I want. I like the system, the rules, and even the metagame.</p>
<p>But, yeah: Taking turf, creating subsidiary gangs? That doesn’t sound like Leverage.</p>
<p>There’s maybe something similar that’d work: Instead of taking turf, businesses, and turning gangs to work for you – getting the corporate yolk out of territory, turning businesses honest, and making friends out of gangs.</p>
<p>That might only require a small change to the baseline system.</p>

              <p>So in a lot of ways Blades is The Wire:The RPG. It is inherently political  It’s about cycles of poverty, corruption and violence.  If you keep the action close enough to the ground, you still have lots of ways to be political without getting involved in federal election theft. Would that sufficiently scratch the politics itch and keep you from going places that heart wants to, but your head thinks is a bad idea?</p>

              <p>So the one place things will get weird is that by default, Blades is about gang warfare. That’s easier to work with in a fantasy setting, but in the modern U.S. that means you’ve got things like treating the Bloods as a high tier faction. It’s very easy for that to go wrong, in portraying organizations like that.</p>
<p>So you’d want to figure out how you’re going to retool the meta game of crew advancement, especially if Leverage is your touchstone. The Leverage team doesn’t advance much as a crew, and they definitely don’t get involved in turf wars.</p>

              <p>I’m not sure how that would work, and I most definetly want to avoid something like “the Oval office is controlled by a Vampire / Werewolf / Mage.”</p>
<p>But maybe you mean something different, more like Gaiman’s Neverwhere or, heck, American Gods? That is, that there is a parallel society of supernatural <em>stuff</em>?</p>

              <p>As our Locke Lamorra infused game of Blades in the Dark begins to reach a natural end point, we’re looking for what to do next.</p>
<p>In part due to <em>Leverage</em>, as well as the nuance and degree of cultural touchstones, we’re thinking about a modern Blades in the Dark Game.</p>
<p>I’d likely run it – it’s been a while and is more or less my turn – and I’m concerned about two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Politics. The central tag of Leverage is: The rich and powerful take what they want. We steal it back for you. Sometimes bad guys make the best good guys. We provide… [Leverage]</li>
</ol>
<p>And, well, there’s a fascist sitting in the Oval and it’d be my natural instinct for the game to head in the direction of, say, stealing back an election. I don’t want it to, as that’s too serious to be fun.</p>
<p>How do I avoid it?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>System changes. Blades has ghost spirits and spirit bombs and whatever else. Our world … seemingly does not. What, if any, changes do I need to make to Blades for it to work in a modern setting?</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you think?</p>
