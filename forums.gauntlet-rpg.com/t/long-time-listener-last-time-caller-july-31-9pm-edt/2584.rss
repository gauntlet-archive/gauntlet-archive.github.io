    <description>*Long Time Listener, Last Time Caller* - July 31st, 9:00 PM EDT

https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LjSlBRYwwDFzS6XZtO9

Hangouts On Air dies on the first of August; let’s rage against the dying of the light.

This session is scheduled for a maximum of 3 hours and will be recorded to share if all players consent. General RSVPs begin on July 17, 2019 at 6:00 PM EDT.

This is a short one-shot freeform game about a talk radio show at the end of the world. Players collaboratively create a cataclysm during the course of play, and the conventions of radio are gradually abandoned in favor of moments of genuine human connection. This game is inspired by spontaneous moments of transcendent radio.</description>
