    <description>![The_Screaming_Staircase|255x357](upload://cJ9P3WCNH2rV4kAxMOLVGobLJAz.png) 

Join a crew of daring scoundrels seeking their fortunes on the haunted streets of an industrial-fantasy city.

There are heists, chases, occult mysteries, dangerous bargains, bloody skirmishes, and, above all, riches to be had — if you’re bold enough to seize them.


We will be playing Blades in the Dark, by John Harper. We will be using the Spirit Hunters crew sheet and rules by Eli Seitz.

The spirit hunters focus on the supernatural elements investigating ghosts, demons, vampires and all the otherworldly things that haunt these darkened streets.


This two session run will focus on establishing the crew and characters and will be continued in the the following months.
Being able to attend both sessions is ideal but not required

This session is expected to be 3 hours long. It will be recorded and posted for viewing per the consent of all involved.

One seat is reserved for Pearl Breaks Games.


Tone and expectation for the game will be discussed. We will be using Script Change and Lines and Veils, along with the Open Door policy being in effect. This series is operating under the Gauntlet&#39;s inclusivity policy, on which more information can be found here (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

Thursday Evenings 8pm EST
