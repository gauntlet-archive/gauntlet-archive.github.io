    <title>Apocalypse World 2e - Carnival of Bullets w/Gauntlet Forum Special</title>

    <description>Come one, come all! This is the place to be, the place to see! The Carnival of Bullets is open for all!

We get it, the apocalypse is hard and worrisome. Where will your next meal come from, who or what will try and kill you next, is that guy over there plotting against you? This is a place to relax, to spend your hard earned barter on a world that&#39;ll let you forget about all those antics and accidents out there.

Come to the Big Top and see the greatest shows the world has to offer, human expertise on a grand scale. Or Aangor&#39;s Magical Wasteland may be more to your taste with themes and history of the past located in its walls. Perhaps you wander the Primordial Fields to collect untainted flora...or fauna. Of course if your tastes are more bold or darker there is Solomon&#39;s Wager and the Halcyon Bureau.

All this and more resides in the Carnival, the wonderful away from your life and dreary normalities! Did you come to the circus or maybe ran away to it to escape the mundane atrocities that dot the world?

Your ticket is good either way. Come, let me stamp it...

Hello and welcome! This is an Apocalypse World 2e game set in a world skeleton of the Carnival of Bullets. This is a take on apocalyptica in the manner of Cannon and Orion films, where the ecstatically weird and bizarre is celebrated in ways where it all seems real and brutal.

Think of this game as a technicolor wasteland: Not layers of gray, brown, dust, and grit but lights and spectacle everywhere. While we have a world skeleton the world itself shall be constructed using these lego pieces I provide by all the players and MC together.

**Number of Sessions** : Shooting for 9 total, straddling July and August.

**Game Hours** : 3 w/breaks

**Set up** : Zoom, Google Drive, &amp; dice roller – this game will not be recorded unless specifically desired to be.

**Safety Tools** : X-card, script change tools, lines &amp; veils, and the Gauntlet open door policy. This game follows the Gauntlet Code of Conduct and is a fully inclusive game – bigotry and hatred are not tolerated. https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html

**Experience Level** : Newbies welcome &amp; encouraged, everything will be provided to play the game.

**Number of Players** : 4 total, with one spot reserved for  **Jon Grim** .

**GAUNTLET FORUM SPECIAL** : I will hold one slot until a week before the game for a person who has never played in a Gauntlet game before, especially you Forum dwellers out there who&#39;ve been eagerly attempting to get into a game. Just message me on Slack or by Forum to reserve a spot.
