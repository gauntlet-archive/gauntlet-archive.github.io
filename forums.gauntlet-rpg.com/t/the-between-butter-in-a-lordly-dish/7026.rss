**The Between** is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of mysterious monster hunters in Victorian-era London. These hunters learn about various monstrous threats in the city and conduct investigations, or “hunts,” in order to neutralize them. They gradually become aware of the machinations of a criminal mastermind who is sometimes connected to the threats, but always scheming to bring the Crown to its knees. The hunters will ultimately be forced to reckon with this criminal mastermind in order to save the country.

Touchstones: Penny Dreadful, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

System: The Between (Powered by the Apocalypse, Carved from Brindlewood)

Content Warnings: The Between is an unavoidably dark game. Murder, cannibalism, body horror, dark sexual themes, threats to children and animals, foul language, blasphemy, witchcraft, and defiling corpses are all things that come up in the game on a fairly regular basis. Safety tools will be used, but at the outset, if you have a suspicion that this game’s themes are not for you, then this game is probably not for you, and that’s perfectly fine. 

Duration : Four 3 hour sessions

Breaks : 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

Venue : GM’s Zoom

Recording : Yes, but made public only with consent by all the players

Attendance : Joining all four sessions is ideal but not required

Safety : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance.

[All Access Monday June 14 12:00:00 MT]
