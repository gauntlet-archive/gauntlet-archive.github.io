    <description>Please allow the first 24 hours for individuals who have not been in a game I&#39;ve run/played with before.

**Allura (Trophy Dark two-shot), October 7 and 14, 8:30 AM-12:00 PM EDT**
A sci-fi horror scenario by Alicia Furness, using Trophy Dark rules.

Trophy Dark is a collaborative storytelling game about doomed characters entering a haunted place that doesn&#39;t want them there.

*The Council’s premier battleship, the Allura, has gone dark…your team has to go in and disconnect the ship from the network, even though previous teams have failed (and haven’t checked back in)…what darkness awaits you on board the Allura?*

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use. 

Each session will be 3.5 hours, with breaks approximately each hour.

Play will be conducted over Zoom, with recording for Keeper review; posting to YouTube will only occur with all participants’ permission.

This is a **two-shot** - only sign up if you are able to make it to both sessions, and you must RSVP to each session.
