    <description>**Star Wars Saturday:Special Edition - Clash of the Sabers**

This one-shot is part of a celebration of 4 years of the Star Wars Saturday games series, brought to you by members of the Gauntlet RPG Community.

In this game, we will be using the Star Wars World playbooks (only the force sensitive playbooks: Adept, Consular, Guardian, Sentinel).

The time period for the game will be sometime between Revenge of the Sith and the Mandalorian.

*Directly after the Empire destroyed the Jedi Temple (during Order 66), a small number of Jedi (or padawans) were able to escape from the Empire&#39;s clutches with a precious cargo--younglings from the temple.*
*These escapees are pursued by Sith Inquisitors who have no mercy and who have killed many who have gotten in the way of their quarry.*

Character creation will be done quickly at the beginning of the session.

The intention is to show the desperation and danger involved and to highlight many cinematic lightsaber battles.
There might be severed limbs!

New players are welcome. No experience is necessary, and rules will be taught during play.
Extensive knowledge of Star Wars is not necessary, but it would help if you&#39;ve seen Revenge of the Sith to set the mood.
