* **Captain Cadava&#39;s Treasure**  - is a campaign for the Pirate Seas setting. A coded treasure map leads the heroes to a long lost treasure. But the heroes aren&#39;t the only ones looking for it, and Captain Cadava might not be quite as dead as people think!
* **The Cryptid Conundrum**  - uses the Adventures Among the Stars setting. Important Space Rangers and Scientists have been kidnapped by the Cryptids, an alien race obsessed with secret codes and puzzles. The heroes must travel to different planets to investigte and unlock the secrets of the Cryptids if they are to foil their plans.
* **A Dream of Trees**  - the wisest animals know that fairy land exists in the dreams of trees. So when things start to go wrong in fairy land might the problems be found with the trees themselves? The heroes will need their wits, and knowledge of the natural world to solve the problems.
