    <description>Hello!

I&#39;ve been asked by staff to locate game designer guests who are not white male heterosexual to be invited by a small gaming convention in Eastern Iowa.

What suggestions do you have for people who the convention staff could invite?</description>

              <p>Thanks so much–that is wonderful to hear! I did editing or proofreading work on all three of the Genesys books that are out. Katrina Ostrander Lee and Lisa Farrell are two female developers for those. Let me know if you want me to ask FFG about folks who worked on those who are LGBTQ or otherwise fit what you’re looking for.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/anat13">@Anat13</a>, thank you for so many names. I will add them to the list. There is a lot of love for the Genesys system games in Eastern Iowa.</p>
<p>I think that I have enough names at the moment and will see what the convention staff have to say.</p>

              <p>If you’re looking for folks who are from the Midwest, developers from Fantasy Flight (based in MN) might be a good idea. Katrina Ostrander Lee, Alexis Dykema, and Callie Oliverius are three of the women I’ve done work for there (I’m a freelance copyeditor). Katrina’s been pretty instrumental in their RPGs, including L5R and Star Wars. Misha Bushyager (New Agenda Publishing) is an important name. Whitney “Strix” Beltrán’s phenomenal (known for Bluebeard’s Bride; her website is <a href="http://www.strixwerks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.strixwerks.com/</a>). Crystal Frasier (Paizo, Green Ronin), Jennell Jacquays (very long-time artist and developer), Chris Spivey (Harlem Unbound, Darker Hue Studios), Eloy Lasanta (Third Eye Games). I can ask my contacts for more names if you want.</p>

              <p>I believe that they would be the guest of the convention. It’s a small con, so my guess is free travel, hotel, registration based on conversations in the past.</p>
