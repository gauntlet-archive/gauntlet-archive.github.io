    <description>For the months of September and October, the Gauntlet Reading Club will be reading [ *The All-Consuming World* ](https://www.erewhonbooks.com/books/the-all-consuming-world-cassandra-khaw) by Cassandra Khaw, paired with [Once More Into the Void ](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/once-more-into-the-void)by Rae Nedjadi.

**Content Warnings for The All-Consuming World: Graphic depictions of violence, unanaesthetized surgery. Abusive relationships. Gender feels. Lots of profanity.**

*Maya has died and been resurrected into countless cyborg bodies through the years of a long, dangerous career with the infamous Dirty Dozen, the most storied crew of criminals in the galaxy, at least before their untimely and gruesome demise. Decades later, she and her diverse team of broken, diminished outlaws must get back together to solve the mystery of their last, disastrous mission and to rescue a missing and much-changed comrade . . . but they’re not the only ones in pursuit of the secret at the heart of the planet Dimmuborgir.* 

*The highly evolved AI of the galaxy have their own agenda and will do whatever it takes to keep humanity from ever regaining control. As Maya and her comrades spiral closer to uncovering the AIs’ vast conspiracy, this band of violent women—half-clone and half machine—must battle their own traumas and a universe of sapient ageships who want them dead, in order to settle their affairs once and for all.* 

This first session is to discuss the book we have read together, our thoughts on it, and what we can draw from it to bring into a roleplaying game. We&#39;ll be drawing on the thematic inspiration of  *The All-Consuming World*  rather than specific plot points, and will have a discussion on tone and content before play, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience.

We&#39;ll be using Zoom to discuss and play, but the sessions will only be recorded and posted publicly with everyone&#39;s enthusiastic consent.

This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials. A seat has been reserved for a player who has not yet been able to participate in the reading club.
