You’re a bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe, post Return of the Jedi timeline. You and your companions work to hunt and turn in bounties for pay against the backdrop of the War, collapse of the Empire, and your own personal battles.

This game will use a hack of Monster of the Week (Powered by the Apocalypse) tweaked and made amazing by Rich Rogers, William H, and David Miessler-Kubanek.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is after the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. 

**Content Warnings** : Gritty Star Wars Violence

**System** : PbtA

**Duration** : One 3 hour session

**Breaks** : 1 mid-point break (~10 mins) or as required

**Venue** : StreamYard or GM’s Zoom

**Safety** : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, Script Change, and open-door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)
