    <description>This event will open for general sign up on September 24th at 7pm.

**System:**  Sonja &amp; Conan Versus The Ninjas

**Duration:**  This session is expected to be 3 hours long

**Attendance:**  Single stand-alone session

**Requirements:**  No reading, preparation or character creation is needed ahead of the session

**Platform:**  Zoom for video conference + Miro Collaborative board for tabletop and gaming aids

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.

&gt; *Ninjas flying and flipping through the air, sorcerers talking in your mind,*
&gt; *nefarious plots and colossal monsters, deserts of ice and fire, slashin&#39; swords and sparklin&#39; spells,*
&gt; *big damn heroes and big bad villains, battle cries, fury, bravery... and hard-hitting punchlines !*

&gt; *You&#39;ll find it all and more in Sonja &amp; Conan vs the Ninjas !*

-------------------------------------------------------------

Sonja &amp; Conan vs the Ninjas is a roleplaying game for 3 to 5 players (we&#39;ll be only 4 including myself for this session).

Together, with simple rules and little to no preparation (I&#39;ll take care of the prep&#39;), we’ll create an epic and colourful story worthy of the Pulp magazines of yore and the Z movies of the 1990s.

Let&#39;s grab a simple six-sided die, a pen and a few post-it notes, crank the Red Sonja or Conan soundtracks up to eleven, unplug our brains and play!

We will impersonate the brave Barbarian or the evil Ninjas, face friends in battle and write a legend through breathtaking action scenes, hard-hitting dialogue scenes and colorful exposition scenes.

Hello, I am Kalum, from [The Rolistes Podcast](https://rolistespod.com/) (check out my own game [ *&quot;Paris Gondo - The Life-Saving Magic of Inventorying&quot;* ](https://rolistespod.com/2020/05/15/announcing-paris-gondo-the-life-saving-magic-of-inventorying/) #ShamelessPlug).

I thought it would be nice to showcase for The Gauntlet an lesser-known (and maybe sometimes not translated yet) indie tabletop RPG from the Old Continent.

So maybe I can call this &quot;Rolistes Connection&quot;?

Anyway, this game is by the excellent [Guillaume Jentey](https://twitter.com/JenteyG) who I had the pleasure of having as [guest for an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzPdDaKHbkA&amp;list=PL2fGTs_dddRzqemJDagJOe_j_bLk2-ZlL&amp;index=27).

You can purchase it via the [author&#39;s Itch.io store](https://guillaumejentey.itch.io/).
