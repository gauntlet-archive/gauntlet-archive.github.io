    <description>![Screen Shot 2020-05-22 at 9.50.55 AM|690x486](upload://5lgRiMRVU6u3imeLl00Lxo1Rc3X.jpeg) 

This one shot game is scheduled for 3 hours. I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance. Sessions will be recorded through Zoom for playtest reference only.

Ready to tell the story of how we kiss kiss and fall in love?

The divine hosts have incarnated. They’re also slightly not used to being so bodied and are slightly lost. They have this magnetic gravity and seem to be out of it.

Would you so kindly, hmm. Date them?

You have karma to unravel! And boy is your penance looking bad/great/good. In a series of unfortunate datesand happenstance you will:

* Meet this Karmic Emanation of An Arch Angel
* Conveniently be the source and solution to each
* other’s problems
* Complicate your Sh*t
* And part ways(?)

Cheers,

Your Soul Investigator

------

This game uses tarot cards as prompts but you don&#39;t need to bring any!

The two main characters - the human &amp; the angel will be shared by the table. This is a GM-less game.

Feel free to check out the game before hand here: https://mariabumby.itch.io/arch-angel-dating-simulator

But otherwise you don&#39;t need prep before coming in to play.

Inspired by slice of life, celestial-but-human stories like Omakae Desu or something like Sandman but w/ more Asian Drama Lovestory.

This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct] and the safety tools [Script Change] and [X-Card] will be in use. The game will go ahead with 2 or more signups.
