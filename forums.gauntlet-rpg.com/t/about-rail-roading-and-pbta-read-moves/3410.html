<p>How do you answer player questions when the answer they ask for their character could not possible have ‚Äúread‚Äù from facial expression or any other way?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Since the rules of AW and most PbtAs state that the GM should always say the truth, if a move allows a player to ask a question it means that getting the answer must be possible.</p>
<p>When you say: ‚Äúthe answer ‚Ä¶ could not possible have ‚Äúread‚Äù from facial expression or any other way‚Äù it seems to me you are trying to establish whether getting that information was possible or not <em>before</em> resolving the move. Which is contrary to the <em>play to find out</em> principle.</p>
<p>In a PbtA you don‚Äôt roll for task resolution, aka whether the character <em>manages to do something</em>. You roll to see <em>what happens</em>. Then, after rolling, you might have to come up with an explanation for <em>how it happened</em>.</p>
<p>So, the player rolls a hit. They ask the question. <em>It means the answer is obtainable</em><br>
It will be fun to come up together with exactly <em>how</em> the character realized that. Maybe they had glanced at a clue before (brief flashback) and just put 2 and 2 together. It is also totally ok to ask the player themselves: <em>the answer is X, how do you know that?</em></p>
<p>The player rolls a failure. They don‚Äôt get to ask questions. <em>It might mean the answers are unobtainable, or that they‚Äôre simply not getting it.</em></p>

          <p>I agree with everything you said.<br>
My question was about how to deliver that answer - tricks and tips, not if I should answer that.<br>
I usually try phrase the answer as character knowledge or flashback, but sometimes it is not possible like when PC meets someone they don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>Slight problem with</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It means the answer is obtainable</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>is that answer to some of the questions is possible and to some is not - like PC can read and answer to ‚Äúhow is your character really feeling‚Äù but ‚Äúhow can I get you to tell me where the secret secret treasure is hidden?‚Äù might not be possible - how do you manage that situations?<br>
Is it possible to say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know this guy and cannot gauge it from his facial expression, ask a different question‚Äù?</p>
<p>As for misses - I‚Äôm a 100% fan of what AW2ed delivered - ask 1 anyway and MC makes a move. I find that it doesn‚Äôt stale the fiction and I can put a good twist on what player wants to learn.</p>

</aside>
<p>I guess I don‚Äôt play that way, maybe? I approach this from the maxim of ‚Äúto do it, do it.‚Äù If nothing occurs to me as a reasonable way you could ‚Äúread‚Äù an answer from facial expressions, then <em>before</em> I tell them the answer to the question, I ask, ‚ÄúWhat are you looking for that might give you a clue about this?‚Äù Sometimes they can‚Äôt come up with anything, and I say, ‚ÄúThat might be a little too specific to just get from asking the way you asked, then.‚Äù</p>

          <p>First of all my bad, I didn‚Äôt make the connection to AW‚Äôs <strong>read a person</strong> where the player still gets to ask one question even on a miss. So yes, scrap that, they get to ask anyway.</p>
<p>I was working on the assumption of a move that works more or less like <em>Discern Realities</em>. In DR you make the fictional heavy lifting <em>before</em> the roll. After the roll, if the player gets to ask you <em>have to answer truthfully</em>.</p>
<p>Now you can be more nuanced than that of course. If the player triggers a DR while only looking at the ceiling you <em>could</em> refuse to give info on a floor hatch. Even in this case though, the fact that as a GM you are expected to always tell the truth for me means that you should at least preface the answer:</p>
<p><em>Look, since you said you were looking in particular at the ceiling, I‚Äôm going to give you info regarding the ceiling, ok? This is what you should be on the look out for‚Ä¶</em></p>
<p><strong>Read a Person</strong> from AW 2ed though says that you get <em>hold</em> to spend <em>during a charged situation</em>. Now the real question is: where are the rules that say <em>when the player is allowed to spend hold</em>?</p>
<p>I‚Äôve found this passage you might be interested in between pages 146 and 147 of AW2. I paraphrase:</p>
<p>X‚Äôs player says he reads Y‚Äôs mood, body language, etc‚Ä¶<br>
Rolls a 7<br>
X‚Äôs player dismissively asks ‚ÄúWhat are Y real feelings?‚Äù<br>
GM answers: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs afraid of Z.‚Äù</p>
<p>Not one sentence is spent to explain how did X understand that Y was afraid of Z‚Ä¶</p>
<p>All in all for me this is an example of the old problem: player skill vs character skill. How much do you want to bash on a lazy player vs how much you want to acknowledge a character‚Äôs power.</p>

<p>During conversation you will recognize how your partner works internally: is he easy to intimidate, is bribe possible, blackmail? Is he lazy, conceited etc.?<br>
The answer to ‚Äúhow can I get you to tell me, where the secret treasure is hidden‚Äù could be ‚ÄúYou took a closer look at <em>x</em> and recognize his distinguished look and the nice jewelry he is wearing.

<p>Personally, I don‚Äôt read ‚Äúhave to answer truthfully‚Äù as ‚Äúhave to answer 100% completely with everything they want to know.‚Äù Like, if a player asks how they could get a character to do something, I might say, ‚ÄúNothing you can say will get them to do this thing,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúHow are you going to get that information? ‚ÄòBy studying their expression?‚Äô Okay, it looks like they‚Äôre nervous about something, but whatever it is, it isn‚Äôt in this room with you right now.

          <p>The move doesn‚Äôt say to answer 100% what the players want to know. It says to answer one of the questions from the list. If you ask me, all the questions in the list are pretty much outside of what you would discern ‚Äúat a glance‚Äù. I‚Äôm guessing the move exists exactly because the Game wants you to know while normally you wouldn‚Äôt be able to.</p>
<p>My reasoning goes like this:<br>
If a player can interact with my npc in a way that is clever enough to make them spill the beans, the npc will do just that, tell them directly or give them an obvious clue.<br>
If <em>I allow the player to roll</em> and they roll a hit, it means that their character (which is conceivably more <em>present</em> in the scene than any of us) found a clue. Why would I withdraw it from them after they already risked a 6-?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I definitely don‚Äôt mean to suggest you should change a success into a failure, and that is a risk of my approach if you‚Äôre not careful. Generally, if I feel like I need to say, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt find that out‚Äù or ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to find,‚Äù unless that‚Äôs a clue in and of itself (‚ÄúWait, he‚Äôs NOT the killer?!‚Äù), I‚Äôll tell the player to go ahead and pick some other option instead.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not saying I want to withhold clues so much as that I want to make sure (a) we connect every move back to the fiction, and (b) I never have to ask players to make up stuff beyond their own character, if they‚Äôre not into that. I don‚Äôt want to just give the answer without a clear explanation of how they found it (that‚Äôs ‚Äúa‚Äù), and I don‚Äôt want to all them ‚Äúwhat do you notice that tells you that?‚Äù because it forces them to change their narrative perspective and responsibilities (that‚Äôs ‚Äúb‚Äù). If I can come up with a good explanation myself for how they suss our information, I‚Äôll just give it and connect it back to the fiction myself, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to ask them to shoulder the labor of ‚Äúto do it, do it‚Äù on their end a bit too.</p>

<p>In my game experiences, often the player has 1-2 questions that they really want answers to and are trying to arrange the fiction to allow them to get, and then maybe some others that they wouldn‚Äôt mind asking, but are less concerned with and which might not fit as fictionally well, and may well be perfectly fine with you saying ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no way you could figure that out from this‚Ä¶‚Äù?</p>

<p>Yeah, in games I‚Äôve played in and run, there‚Äôs a little bit of negotiation that goes on either before the roll (if it‚Äôs a bit of a stretch and we‚Äôre trying to figure out how the move will happen fictionally) or after (if the question the player wants to ask doesn‚Äôt exactly fit their fictional narration of the move). The MC will work to try to help the player find a fictional positioning to do what they want, and players are understanding in the cases where it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense in the story.</p>

          <p>I finished writing my take on Discern Realities for <em><a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/stonetop.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Stonetop</a></em> recently, and tried to address a lot of these questions.  Nothing that hasn‚Äôt been said yet, I don‚Äôt think, but maybe it‚Äôs useful anyhow?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶<br>
Answer honestly, generously, and helpfully. Rely on your prep and sense of the fictional space to guide you. Sometimes (often), you‚Äôll need to make up details on the fly. These details become true parts of the fiction! If you aren‚Äôt sure how to answer the question, ask the player for guidance. <em>‚ÄúWell, the old coins are obviously valuable, but what sort of thing were you looking for?‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Remember to begin and end with the fiction. Don‚Äôt just tell them that Siowan is about to betray them; describe how Siowan is acting nervous and keeps glancing at the door, like he‚Äôs expecting someone to burst in any second. Alternately: answer their question directly and simply, and ask <em>them</em> what details lead them to that conclusion.</p>
<p>Adjust your answers to reflect the fiction. The move isn‚Äôt magic; it doesn‚Äôt let the characters know things that they couldn‚Äôt. A quick scan of the room from the entrance should give less-specific and less-useful insights than if they get in there and interact.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll feel pressure to give answers that are surprising or revelatory, but often the best answer is the obvious one. ‚Äú <em>What here is valuable or useful to me?‚Äù ‚ÄúThose gold coins that I described earlier. Everything else is basically junk.‚Äù</em> And sometimes the honest, helpful answer is basically ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù <em>‚ÄúWhat should I be on the lookout for?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot much. This place seems quite safe.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho or what is in control here?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo one. It‚Äôs a damn free-for-all.‚Äù</em> Such answers remove doubt and clarify the situation (and remember, they get advantage on their first roll to act on the answer).<br>
‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PCs are staring up at a crinwin nest. They ask about its size (‚Äúas big as a house back in Stonetop‚Äù) and the tree it‚Äôs in (‚Äúlike a redwood sequoia, the lowest bough maybe 60 feet up‚Äù) and whether they see anything moving about the nest (‚Äúnope‚Äù). Then Rhianna asks ‚ÄúCan I tell if there‚Äôs been activity recently? We‚Äôll look for tracks and whatnot.‚Äù  That‚Äôs looking for insight, not just data, so she‚Äôs Discerning Realities.</p>
<p>She rolls +WIS (with advantage as her crew Aids her) and gets a 10+.  ‚ÄúIs the nest still active? Like, are there any signs of recent activity?‚Äù she asks.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs two questions, neither of which are on the list. ‚ÄúAre you asking ‚Äòwhat happened here recently?‚Äô Or ‚Äòwhat should I be on the lookout for?‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOh, yeah. Um, what should I be on the lookout for? Specifically, should we be on the lookout for crinwin right now?‚Äù  I say no, nothing to be on the lookout for. The nest seems to be unoccupied and even damaged. Geralt (from her crew) calls her over and shows her the crinwin bodies he found, rotting away in the brush.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhoa. Okay‚Ä¶ what happened here recently?‚Äù</p>
<p>I tell her that they find more crinwin corpses, and a few that appear to have killed each other. ‚ÄúA few weeks old, at least. But there aren‚Äôt enough corpses for a full a nest. And you find signs of crinwin dragging off other crinwin, in the same general direction they carried off Pryder.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù spits Rhianna. ‚ÄúWho or what is really in control here? Like‚Ä¶ who or what is behind this?‚Äù</p>
<p>I know that Sethra the swyn (a giant, hypnotic, monkey-headed snake) is behind the attack., but I don‚Äôt see how Rhianna could possibly deduce that. So, I give her as useful of an answer as I think the evidence would allow: ‚ÄúDown the path a little, you spot, like, a‚Ä¶ scale? Like a drake scale, but bigger. Flatter. More like a snake, maybe? And it‚Äôs got a golden shimmer to it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo I recognize it?‚Äù Rhianna asks, and I say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, sounds like you‚Äôre Spouting Lore?‚Äù  And she agrees, and rolls with advantage for following up on an answer.</p>
