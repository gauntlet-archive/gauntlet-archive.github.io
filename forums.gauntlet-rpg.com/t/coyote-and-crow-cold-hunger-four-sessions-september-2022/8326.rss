Coyote &amp; Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You&#39;ll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It&#39;s a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide. Created by a team of Native Americans, this is a world where players from all backgrounds will find excitement, adventure and something new in the world of role playing.

We will create characters and play a four session campaign of Coyote and Crow. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

No prior-system knowledge is required and it will be taught during the session. A new dice system was created just for this game, using only d12s. The rule system that doesn’t focus on violence as the first option for story resolution.

The Storyteller (a.k.a., the GM) has not played this game before but will prepare for the sessions. The group will play through the introductory encounter.

### Tools and safety:

The following safety tools will be in use: CATS, Lines &amp; Veils, and the X-card. The session will follow the[ Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the Open Door Policy is in place meaning anyone should feel free to leave the game, or cancel as needed.

The session will be played over Zoom with two tools over a web browser: an online dice roller and a Google Sheets document with the characters. The Zoom link will be provided the night before.

It will be recorded assuming all parties agree. 

A check-in email will be sent a week prior which MUST be replied to in order to have confirmed that you&#39;re playing in the game. Otherwise your spot will be offered to the next person on the waitlist.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
