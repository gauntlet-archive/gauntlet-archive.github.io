    <title>Gauntlet Podcast: Fav Game of the Year</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-podcast-fav-game-of-the-year/3982</link>
    <description>Each year we do a special episode of The Gauntlet Podcast featuring community members talking about the favorite RPG they played. This doesn&#39;t have to be an RPG released this year, it could be an old fave you had a great time with. We&#39;d like to hear from you! Here&#39;s how you can participate.
*Record your audio locally with something like Audacity and upload it to our dropbox folder as an mp3 or wave file.
*Alternately, record it on Youtube and send us a link so we can pull the audio from that.
*Submissions should be a couple of minutes in length: your name, your pick, and why you chose it.
*We&#39;d like submissions by Dec. 15th.
*If you have any questions, hit me or @RichRogers  up.

              <p>As someone reminded me of an option we had last year: if you just give us a link to a clip, we’ll download and convert that. We just want to hear what everyone dug in 2019. .</p>

              <p>Just a reminder that we’re still looking for submissions for our Game of the Year episode of The Gauntlet Podcast. If anyone needs help getting this recorded, message <a class="mention" href="/u/richrogers">@RichRogers</a> or I. One thing we’ve done in the past is to set up quick online events, record those to YouTube privately, and then strip the audio out.</p>
