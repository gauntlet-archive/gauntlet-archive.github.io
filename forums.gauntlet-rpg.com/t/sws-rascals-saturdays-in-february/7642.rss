You are Rascals: ex-special forces for the Rebellion (they weren&#39;t called the  *New Republic*  back then). Hard-boiled types who worked together in the hottest zones during the &quot;former unpleasantness&quot;. You were some of the few who managed to get out, make a new life, but something has changed all that...

Now the old crew is together again, you Rascals who survived the bloody final years of a terrible war, have been pulled back. An abominable plot is unfolding in secret...

From high-tech cityscapes to shattered habitation domes, through the heaving corridors of stations in chaos to empty transfer stations and the broken worlds beyond... Where will your path lead, and what awaits at your journey’s end?

--------------

Rascals game system uses traditional playing cards and poker chips and is designed to bring the tension, twists of fortune, and calculated gambles of action-adventure stories to the fore.

-------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and will be added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).
