Growing up, you learned to cherish the keep: it&#39;s heavy walls, high towers, and busy rulers ensured you were brought in a place at once safe and cosmopolitan. Now you are coming of age and should make your destiny and find your place. But now, the peace of this ancient keep is broken by violence and someone dear to you is found murdered. With no clues to lead you to the killer, you begin to wonder what devilish games are being played in your once safe home.

Barrow Keep is a playbook-driven fantasy adventure game in the spirit of Beyond the Wall. You are the heirs, the wards, the apprentices, and young courtiers of Barrow Keep, and you must do what the more senior members of the house cannot: protect the keep from the enemies that have already come into its walls.

This is a playtest series and we&#39;ll be using a simple OSR-inspired system to test the playbooks and scenario packs of Barrow Keep.

Being able to attend each session is strongly encouraged. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours and will be recorded.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools such as Lines and Veils and [The X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use.

              <p>Let’s reawaken this thread from it’s dreaming slumber to say I’ve got one opening and it starts tonight!</p>
<p><em><em>Barrow Keep</em></em> is a playtest game of grim, OSR-adjacent Kids-in-a-Castle adventures and mysteries inspired by a Slack post last spring by Thoobn!</p>
<ul>
<li>Session 1 (Tonight): <a href="https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LeEBSckpFmOmoXz6_CT" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LeEBSckpFmOmoXz6_CT</a>

<li>Session 2 (Tuesday, June 18): <a href="https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LeEBhXDyUWJrejFCpfr" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LeEBhXDyUWJrejFCpfr</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Attending all sessions is entirely optional, but tonight’s session will be driven by character creation and building the castle, with most of the mystery itself playing out in sessions 2 and 3.</p>
