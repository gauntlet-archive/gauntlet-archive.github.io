    <title>Moth Children | A Vampire TTRPG by Dane Asmund - Kickstarter</title>

    <description>I keep an eye on upcoming Kickstarters during the week in preparation of my collection. Which saw me coming across the **[Moth Children](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosmicmirrorgames/moth-children/)** vampire game byof Dane Asmund. 

It sparked my interest as I am very interested in Vampire games and storytelling mechanics and the project combines both. Including an approach to the mythology that I consider fresh and was quite new to me.

The game system is based on the players filling out their wheel of abilities and the storyteller having a wheel of their own with some of the difficulties noted. When a conflict occurs the numbers get compared and a result is determined. With the difficulty wheel being adjusted.

I am not sure whether I grasp it in full, but it does sound interesting.
The only thing that I might adjust would be, to maybe set the world in a fashion that vampires aren&#39;t antagonistic to each other and got different ways of obtaining a new moth. Maybe give it a bit of a VtM reskinning ^^;

What do you think of it?
