Maybe you did incredibly well this year and got noticed. Maybe you did okay, but had lots of extracurricular activities that raised your profile. Maybe you were a complete and total wreck and set off the fire alarm during multiple science labs and/or home economics classes, and maybe even during a swim class (How? Why? You&#39;ll never tell). Maybe you were just too conspicuously average (the exact middle of any bell curve can look just as conspicuous as the edges, I guess). Whatever the reason, you and several of your fellow teenage superfolks have been promoted/selected/elected/drafted into the New Gauntlet City PRIME (Provisions for Reason, Integrity, Merit, and Edification) Summer Symposium, a six-week program that involves some classroom instruction, some hands-on learning, and even some study abroad in the way that only New Gauntlet City, in association AEON&#39;s Youth Opportunity and Local Outreach coordinators, can!

We&#39;ll be playing Masks: A New Generation from Magpie Games, a game of teenage superheroes, angst, and identity. We&#39;ll be discussing tone, content, and safety tools in session 1, as well as creating the characters, setting up their relationships, and how they all got together as a team.

Our story will take place in the Gauntlet Comics shared universe, a creation of the Gauntlet Community&#39;s own Rich Rogers, Lowell Francis, and Jim Crocker. For more about Gauntlet Comics, see the wiki: http://gauntletcomics.i95games.com/

Each session is scheduled to run for 3 hours, Fridays in July, 2019, beginning on July 5, 2019, at 8:00 PM EST. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

There will be 4 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
