    <description>Hello, 
Do you know a place someone could play weird games online in english in the neighbourhood of the Sidney, Australia, timezone? 

A friend of mine lives there. They have a hard time finding players who share their special tastes, that is a love for weird games like Itras By and Meanwhile in the subway. Of course I told them to get onboard the Gauntlet calendar. Any suggestions?</description>

              <p>Hey, thanks! That’s just perfect!<br>
Of course <a class="mention" href="/u/hopeless_wanderer">@Hopeless_Wanderer</a>, I thought of you straightaway. Does it mean I can give your contact to my friend?<br>
You can tell me here or by private mail. Btw, in most of July I’ll be available at antipodes times, being on holidays.</p>
