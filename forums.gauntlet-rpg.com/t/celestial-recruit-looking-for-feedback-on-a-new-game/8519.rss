    <title>[Celestial Recruit] Looking For Feedback on a New Game</title>

    <description>Hello friends!
It has been a little while since I have hung out on the forums. Hope everyone is doing well :) 

I recently created my first-ever proper game (well, an alpha version) for the Goes Over Well game jam in November. Very excited to actually have something real on itch! I&#39;m going to be arranging some playtests in January onwards, but I was also looking for general feedback, comments, questions, and suggestions from people reading over the text (or playing it on their own without me!).

I plan on fleshing this game out going forward!

If you are interested in taking a look you can download it for free at: https://flockofwingeddoors.itch.io/celestial-recruit-the-war-for-the-fourth-link

Please feel free to reach out! Happy to explain, clarify, and take constructive criticism. I&#39;m sure I have lots to learn about making RPGs and making them well :)</description>

              <p>Hi, My main feedback is that the mechanics could be written more sparingly, and emphasised graphically to help learning.<br>
