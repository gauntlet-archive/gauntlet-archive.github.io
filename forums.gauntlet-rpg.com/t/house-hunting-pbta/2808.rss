    <description>House Hunting (PBTA)
====================

Player decides how many rooms they need for : 
- Bed rooms                                           &gt;3 =-1 to Finding.
- Entertainment (lounge, rumpus, gaming)  &gt;2 =-1 to Decorating.
- Function (WC, Bathroom, Kitchen)        &gt;3 =-1 to Renovating.

Location (Modifiers to core rolls)
In the Country : +1 to Finding roll, -1 to Renovation.
Suburbs :        Standard, as is. 
Downtown :       -1 to Finding roll, +1 to Decorating.


Finding the home 2d8.
15+   = You find a house with the right amount of rooms, +1 to Renovating roll.
12-14 = You find a house with 1 less room that you need. 
7-11  = You find a house with 2 less rooms. 
        -1 Renovating roll if you still want the rooms.
4-6   = Place is old and needs repairs. -1 to Renovating roll.
3-    = Your bank account was hacked and your car stolen. 
        You now share a room with a friend who smells of socks.

Renovating the home 2d8
15+   = You renovate all the rooms just the way you want them. 
12-14 = You renovate all the rooms but are delayed by supplies for 1 month.
7-11  = You renovate all but 2 of the rooms. 
        -1 to Decorating roll if you still renovate all of them.
4-6   = You renovate half the rooms but are delayed by supplies for 2 months.
3-    = You renovate one room. It looks just dandy. 

Decorating the home 2d8 
15+   = Every room is a master piece of style and decor.
12-14 = The house rooms are nice, but the yard is ecclectic. 
7-11  = Half the rooms are nice, half the rooms are not bad.
4-6   = Raccoons on pixie dust decorated, it certainly is colorful. Everywhere.
3-    = Everything is a mess. You now share your home with a cousin who talks like The Nanny.</description>

              <p>One Shot made a satirical game called Millennial Apartment Hunters about being forced into getting terrible housing on an HGTV show. It’s certainly not a serious take, but it is great for a parody game.</p>

              <p>I would love a game (PbtA or otherwise) inspired by all those HGTV house hunting/remodeling shows. Maybe less so by the actual experience of house hunting, but that could just be me being bitter about having to move into a smaller place this month because the old landlord jacked up the rent <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
