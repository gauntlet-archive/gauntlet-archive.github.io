This is a run of [Voidheart Symphony](https://ufopress.co.uk/voidheart-symphony/), a PbtA game of urban horror and psychonautic rebellion by [Minerva McJanda](https://twitter.com/minahoneybat) of UFO Press. This session will be a four-hour one-shot using the [Kill or Cure](https://ufopress.co.uk/product/voidheart-symphony-kill-or-cure/) quickstart rules. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (August 17th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our session. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

***The MacGregor Clinic is deeply sick.***

*Patients vanish into shady drug trials.*

*Scalpel-fingered monsters haunt nurses’ dreams.*

*A nightmare realm hides behind the clinic’s mirrors.*

*Diagnose the clinic and purge its sickness in  **Kill or Cure.***

Voidheart Symphony is a game about a group of rebels fighting back against oppression, infiltrating and disrupting The Castle, a mystical/psychic construct which empowers the cruel and selfish and helps them hold onto their power. You will alternate tense investigations in a hostile city, and feats of superhuman power in the psychic shadow-realm of The Castle. In this one-off session, you will be focusing on the abuses of Dr. Gardner at the MacGregor clinic.

Content Warnings: Voidheart Symphony is a game set in a world similar to our contemporary one, with a dark shadow realm. It focuses in particular on fighting back against oppression, and as such themes of marginalisation, exploitation, and oppression are central to the game. Kill or Cure is a scenario about the ways the medical establishment punishes, marginalises and ignores those on the fringes of society. To that end, it carries a content warning for: medical procedures (injections, surgery, IV drips, etc), medical malpractice, ableism, violation of bodily autonomy, gatekeeping, abuse of power, institutional bigotry and invasion of privacy.  We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
