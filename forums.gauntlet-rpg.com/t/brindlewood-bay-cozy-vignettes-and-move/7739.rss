    <description>Hello!
I just bought Brindlewood Bay and plan to run a session soon.

Going through the rulebook, I have a few questions (and will likely have more in the near future). Sorry if the answer is obvious, I just couldn&#39;t find it.

There they are:

- Cozy Vignettes: they are just for the atmosphere, right? Seems like they have no impact on the game at all.

- Cozy Move: The cozy move is triggered during investigations, when two or more Mavens request a downtime together, right? Is there a limit to how many times a Cozy move can trigger in a single session? Once per day? Giving out a clue seems pretty powerful, especially if you have like 4 Mavens and they do 2 couples of cozy moves at the same time.

- Is the Meddling Move implicitly tied to a mystery? You could have characters/locations that are connected to more than one mystery. Will the Maven know to which mystery is the clue connected to?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Yeah, while the original BB suggested having multiple mysteries is possible, the Nephews in Peril supplement revisits that and suggests doing a single mystery at a time. In my play, and that of many others, doing one at a time allowed breathing room for the mystery and kept the focus. It’s especially true given that you have the Big Conspiracy in the background kind of tying things together.</p>
<p>If you are doing two at a time, I’d have the Maven make explicit which one they’re investigating and then associate the clue with that one. In our online keepers, we generally keep a page per mystery so you would be able to keep track which goes with which.</p>

              <p>Yes - they give players a chance to play up the ‘cozy’.<br>
No - there’s no limit defined but my advice would be to follow the fiction and if it looks like it’s getting silly intervene as GM to move the narrative on.<br>
My view is that BB operates on the basis of ‘one mystery at a time’ (The Between explicitly has multiple ‘theeata’ in play at the same time) … so I wouldn’t introduce a new mystery until the current one is solved.</p>
