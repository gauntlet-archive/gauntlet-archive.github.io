“Tired Of Life? Join The Expeditionary Force And See The Cosmos.”
— Recruitment Advert

![Vrakk-300x218|300x218](upload://xbnxgKRSq4X1KcNzjxKjf85Twk8.jpeg) 

The elite 3:16th Expeditionary Force left Terra many years ago with an explicit mission: Alien civilizations, intelligences and life of any kind are to be wiped out to protect the future safety of the people home on Terra.

**Content Warning:** Militarism, Genocide

These session are scheduled for 3.5 hours, and will be recorded.

This is for four sessions of 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars. Being able to attend each session is not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. This is a continuation of previous sectors played and if you played in those you are welcome to return to duty with your Trooper. But if you didn’t fresh meat is always welcome on the front lines!

We will be using Zoom as the platform. Participants must be able to access Roll20 tools for the game.

The X-card will be in use. For more information on the Gauntlet’s safety tools, please refer to our [Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) on the website.
