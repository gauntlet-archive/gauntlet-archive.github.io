    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/11/16/crowdfunding-collection-184/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #184, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/07 and 11/15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

You’ll find that last week has seen the start of quite some interesting crowdfundings to check out.
In another regards I included a new icon – the crying star: star – which is reserved for projects I would have backed, yet the creators don’t offer shipping to Germany.
