    <description>Hello all!

Nice to meet you!

First of all, I want to thank all of the participants in this AP for giving us a wonderful story to listen to! HoW is such a beautiful game (I&#39;m still super sad that i totally missed that Kickstarter :cry: )

Now, here&#39;s my question: It seems that the last part of that series (part 4) has not been uploaded to the podcast channel. Is that possible? I couldn&#39;t find it on my app on the i-phone. I see that there is a VoD on youtube of it.
I&#39;d really love to finish this story, preferably via podcast.

If i may, i&#39;ll add another question: there are a lot of HoW APs on the podcast (yay!), any recommendations in what order I should listen to them? Any that stand out in quality? As said, Romance of the Golden Dragon was very enjoyable for me...so if any of the others are as good or even better, I&#39;m sold.

Thanks in advance!

And thanks again for sharing your stories with us!</description>

              <p>PS: lots of people post links to sessions after the announcement of sessions … or at least I do … and when you start a topic you get automatic prompts when people contribute to it … I think.  Hence good way to get the GMs attention.</p>

              <p>Ye Gods - it probably is me … If CelticNotts is the GM then it probably is me.  I played in at least 2 of Gerwyn’s series and forgot the name of this one.  I have a distant memory of us having to cram a lot into a session because we were running 1 session light … Will go back and check.</p>

              <p>Thanks to both of you, I appreciate it!</p>
<p>Funny, I somehow thought you were part of that game, <a class="mention" href="/u/alun_r">@Alun_R</a> (there is an Alun Rees mentioned in the notes on YT, I thought that was you ^^ ) . But I do think that the series in question was GM-ed by CelticNotts.<br>
I looked on youtube again and the last part is also missing on the Gauntlet YT channel. It is on CelticNotts YT, though (as I said in my OP).<br>
I guess I can download the audio-file from youtube, but I thought maybe the persons involved would like to know that an episode is missing.</p>
<p>And thanks for the tips, <a class="mention" href="/u/alun_r">@Alun_R</a>. I wasn’t sure that it was polite to post in the threads in the Hangouts subforum, where it seemed to be more of an “announcement” thing. But good to know.<br>
Yes, I could also post to the YT channel, but as i wanted to join the Gauntlet community, I thought I’d ask here first <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hi, <a class="mention" href="/u/indris">@Indris</a> - I’m not directly familiar with the series.  If the videos are posted here to n the Hangouts channel, then asking the question is more likely to attract the poster’s attention.  If you saw the AP on YouTube, them maybe asking your question in the comments might get an answer from them.  Hope that’s helpful.</p>
