    <description>This series is a continuation of: https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/urban-shadows-2e-gauntlet-empire-city-everybodys-going-uptown/6068

The northern Manhattan neighborhoods of Washington Heights and Inwood, far from the glitz of Times Square. are home to diverse ethnic and religious communities. Most famously, the large community of Dominican immigrants, but the bodegas of Broadway are nestled right up next Korean groceries, Kosher restaurants, and stores catering to the large number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. These communities don&#39;t stop at the water, but extend out to the surrounding areas of the South Bronx and the suburbs of Bergen County, NJ. And of course, it&#39;s not just human communities that live in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge. Werewolves, Vampires, Wizards, Trolls (of course!) and magical folk of every sort jockey for position. It&#39;s rarely quiet uptown.

**This series is the continuation of a previous series. 24 hour priority is given to the players of the original series** . This is a series of 5 games of Urban Shadows 2e on Thursday evenings in April at 8PM Eastern US Time as a part of the Gauntlet&#39;s Empire City shared world. Empire City is a set of loosely interconnected Urban Supernatural games that take place in New York and its surrounding areas. This game will be centered in Washington Heights/Inwood Manhattan, but may extend into the surrounding and related communities of the South and West Bronx, and Northern New Jersey. No prior knowledge or experience of the setting is required. We will be using the Urban Shadows 2E quickstart.

Rules will be taught. Sessions will run up to three and a half hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils, script change and the X-Card for safety tools. All Access Sign up begins 11/11/2020 at noon

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
