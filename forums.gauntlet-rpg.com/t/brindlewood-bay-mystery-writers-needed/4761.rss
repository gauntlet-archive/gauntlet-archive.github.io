    <description>We&#39;re going to begin publishing Brindlewood Bay mysteries in the pages of Codex. If you&#39;re a TTRPG writer (established or otherwise) interested in writing some of these mysteries, we want to hear from you.

Brindlewood Bay is a game that combines cozy murder mystery stories with Lovecraftian horror. It&#39;s Murder, She Wrote meets The Shadow Over Innsmouth. The game (plus 5 accompanying mysteries) was recently published via The Gauntlet Patreon. Anyone interested in writing a mystery for the game should be familiar with the game&#39;s text and the mysteries that have already been published. If you aren&#39;t a member of the Gauntlet Patreon, I can send you a copy of the materials—just email me. 

We currently need a Brindlewood Bay mystery for each of these upcoming issues of Codex: Hearthfire and Colossus. Ideally, the mysteries will be connected to those themes in some way (even if very loosely). 

We&#39;re paying .10 USD/word for these. That&#39;s higher than our normal Codex rate, but we intend to use these for a standalone Brindlewood Bay project down the road, too. 

For more details or to simply express your interest, email me at gauntletpublish at gmail dot com. Please put &quot;Brindlewood Bay Writer&quot; in your subject line.
