    <title>Codex - Melancholy Miscellany</title>

    <description>Hey Gauntleteers, it’s time to crowdsource the miscellany for Codex - Melancholy. This miscellany is called “Three Dozen Things Lost, Perhaps Forever.” Submissions need to be a single sentence, or 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you&#39;re agreeing to let us use it (you&#39;ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Here are some examples:

“Historians are divided about whether the late Dr. Zuleyma Stokes ever made it to the surface of Stradus Q118, but the planet’s fierce magnetic storms make a remote examination of its surface all but impossible. A recent expedition to retrieve her body went silent on descent, the crew assumed lost.”

“Faith returned bolder and kinder, brimming with stories she could never tell of timid giants and bronze statues that bent to listen and never never told her she was lying. The next time a blackberry bush bent just so, leaving an opening just large enough for a girl willing to sacrifice her dress for more important things, she wasted no time on goodbyes.”

“The Emperor has promised a fortune in land and jewels to anyone who can rediscover the technique of spinning song into silk, taunted by antique dresses and shawls that turn every rustle and fold into an ever-changing symphony.”

P.S. If you want to be credited as something other than the name on your forum profile, let me know! DMs here or on Slack (@ryanm) are fine for that, but please keep submissions in this thread.

Not long after, the building was destroyed, and the portal went the way of all video-store portals. Netflix hasn’t figured those out yet.</p>

Punk bands, the chamber orchestra, childrens’ dance recitals, the annual Rotary Club Talent Show, and even some big-name acts: Joan Baez played there back in '96. It’s been a parking lot since the accident. Three actors died on stage during the dress rehearsal of a play. The owner had the place demolished not a month later… which was kind of weird. The play? It never opened. I think it was called <em>The King in Yellow</em> or something like that.</p>

              <p>The last rose bush from the Duchy of Melcos stand in a neglected corner of the Imperial palace. The Melcovites are all gone, married into the general populace, and the little old gardner who took care of it passed a thricemoon ago. The roses will probably die sooner or later - they are neither very brightly colored nor do they smell exceptionally nice, and then who will remember the Rose-Godess of Melcor and her gentle reign?</p>
<p>Ellen and Bob used to chase hurricanes together, until the one day Ellen didn’t make it out of the eye of the storm. Ever since then, you can see Bob waiting on tornadoes and other violent storms, never daring to go too close, yet never able to leave the winds alone.</p>
<p>You probably don’t know that Valentine Rios continued to write poems after his decline. Dementia took his faculties, and eventually his language before finally claiming everything. Hard to say where his last poems are, really - his partner Musa claims he burned them, but did he? Really?<br>
.<br>
There was this cherry tree when you were young, somewhere in the neighbourhood. It was the only tree with branches gentle enough for an awkward child like you to climb, but when new neighbours moved in, the tree had to go. Your parents told you that it had been taken to the wilderness to finish its life there, but the older you grow, the less you believe that.</p>
<p>Once, the city had a wide open space, a park with old trees and swathes of grass for people to gather, fountains for children to play with in the sun. But the city elders wanted to build something grand on that ground, something that would make people remember. The people of the city fought, shouted, lived in the old trees, built a tent city, yet they could not prevail - nowadays, there’s only a hole in the ground and the noise of the builders, and the memory of good times past.<br>
(Yes, okay, that one’s our stupid train station. So I’m bitter about this. So there.)</p>

              <p>It took surprisingly few years for even the name of the False God to be forgotten. After Glorious Revolutionary Comrade Leader made public examples of the last prelates and priestesses, people turned over their relics meekly and the daily prayers ceased. It was safest to forget the name entirely—though a few mad youngsters think if they found and spoke the name once more, the spark of reactionary faith could be rekindled.</p>

              <p>Milo was some sort of black lab mix, and Liza found him on the edge of an abandoned lot in Phoenix not long after she got the hell out of Nogales and her life with Herman. Dirty and matted but friendly and pretty well-fed, Liza took Milo in even though she was living out of her car. Liza finally seemed to be getting her feet under her–apartment, steady work, even a couple friends–when Milo just up and vanished, his collar left inside her locked apartment next to a cactus flower blooming well out of season.</p>

It was last seen in Milton’s Architectural, the kind of warehouse studio that sells 60-foot slabs of polished marble embedded with trilobite fossils and 500-year-old teakwood temple doors that were pilfered from Nepal in the colonial heyday. There was a break-in one night, and one of the thieves was left for dead, and the only thing missing was the Bowl.</p>
