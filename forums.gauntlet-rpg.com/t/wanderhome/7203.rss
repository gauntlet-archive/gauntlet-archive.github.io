    <description>CONTENT WARNING: Memories of violence, sadness, loss, grief.

DESCRIPTION: The road has a song all to its own. Press your ear against my chest and you’ll hear it. It is always with me, soaring across mountain tops and sleeping in the gutter where the small and forgotten gods live.It tangles through my hair and sits heavy in my boots. Some days that song roars through my bones louder than any storm,and other days it hums its tune so quietly that I could forget it’s even there. But I will always hold tight to it, and I’ll throw on my cloak, grab my walking stick, and set foot once more.
