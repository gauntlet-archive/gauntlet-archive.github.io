    <description>Hi! I was curious: what RPG are you currently playing that could benefit from a digital toolset?

I&#39;ve realized that making a digital toolset is *really* within my wheelhouse, and I&#39;d love to enable digital play for smaller games.

I&#39;ve asked elsewhere but I keep getting suggestions like *GURPS* or *World of Darkness*, which are... bigger than I want. I&#39;m looking at games that are PbtA/FitD/adjacent. One or two authors. My shortlist right now includes games like *NOVA*, *ICON*, *Fellowship*, etc.

If you could pull up a character sheet (or a &quot;GM screen&quot; with all your NPCs and players), click some buttons and have dice roll in your Discord channel, and that&#39;s about it, what systems need some love?

TIA!</description>

              <p>I’m actually working on software for playing galactic 2e and going rogue 2e online. I’m making it in Godot, which might be overkill, but it’s the tool I know best.</p>
<p>I’ve made a ton of progress on it, and I’m grateful that the designers have given it their blessing. I’d say it’s about 70-80% done. But my life has gotten pretty busy recently and I might not be able to dive back into it until the fall. If all goes well, my ambition would definitely be to make tools for more BOB games. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m having fun making a bespoke tool for g2e/gr2e (Star Wars fonts and all that), but for a future project, maybe something generic that can handle any BOB game would be ideal.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/citizenkeen">@CitizenKeen</a> – Not sure if you’re still interested in this kind of project, but I’m curious what you had in mind. Like I said, an executable built in Godot miiiight be overkill for this project. I’m learning JS, React, etc, right now, and I’m tempted to try to port my work over and just make it a website at some point. Would be curious to hear your thoughts!</p>

              <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I ended writing a tool that put both sides of the cards side-by-side as a single image, and did some tricks with premade stacks of cards. Your can also “hide” some zones.</p>
<p>But but those tricks don’t quite solve flipping and shuffling needs, just sort of half-assed way to work good enough for some playtesting.</p>

<p>I still haven’t found a good online solution — none of the current RPG tools even do basic index cards for story games. The best solution I’ve come up with so far is to upload all my tableau cards to Miro (a business white board site) and use their post-it notes features.</p>

              <p>Oh boy, you and me both. That’s absolutely something I’d love to tackle, but part of this project is identifying reusable RPG components, so I think I want to tackle two or three other games before I get to Flying Circus. Probably at least one other, simpler PbtA game. But yeah, Chappell’s work is <code>&lt;chef kiss/&gt;</code> and Flying Circus could definitely benefit from a digital toolset.</p>

It’s 2d10, but they roll 0-9, explode on a 9, and one die generates a positive number (the bonus die), the other generates a negative number (the penalty die). Add the result of the roll to an ability score and compare to a target number.</p>

              <p>Hi! I was curious: what RPG are you currently playing that could benefit from a digital toolset?</p>
<p>I’ve realized that making a digital toolset is <em>really</em> within my wheelhouse, and I’d love to enable digital play for smaller games.</p>
<p>I’ve asked elsewhere but I keep getting suggestions like <em>GURPS</em> or <em>World of Darkness</em>, which are… bigger than I want. I’m looking at games that are PbtA/FitD/adjacent. One or two authors. My shortlist right now includes games like <em>NOVA</em>, <em>ICON</em>, <em>Fellowship</em>, etc.</p>
<p>If you could pull up a character sheet (or a “GM screen” with all your NPCs and players), click some buttons and have dice roll in your Discord channel, and that’s about it, what systems need some love?</p>
<p>TIA!</p>
