    <title>A pessimistic view on RP</title>

    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m wondering about the chit chat between characters called RP. One aspect of it is being a last safe place for creativity when a GM deprives their players of agency. Princess Play, Magic Tea Party (character expression and IC small talk), moral debates, In Character planification, and maybe other forms, all seem to be rooted in this safe-haven. This consideration starts from a pessimistic view, but it leads to an evolutionary approach that can be less judging. To me, the old solution to the Impossible thing before breakfast (GM writes, players read) created all these effects that have then been magnified by various play styles. 
Have these links between agency and various forms of conversations in play been studied?</description>
