One seat is reserved for a member who has joined the Gauntlet since the beginning of 2021. If this is you, feel free to message me – @jonjongrim  – or email me at jonjongrim@gmail.com.

All access time is March 11th, 8 PM US Eastern.

## Concept

This will be a run of five sessions of Trophy Gold, on Fridays in April. The incursions will be shorter incursions with the hopes that we will play through two incursions, plus engage the Hearthfire rules in between.

The first, Devil’s Tomb, is a conversion of a short Mӧrk Borg dungeon, and I am considering doing a conversion of The Death Ziggurat for the second.

Players are encouraged to sign up for as many sessions as they can, but attendance at each session is not required. I expect the first dungeon will take the first two session, and the second dungeon and Hearthfire portion will be in the last three.

## Aim

Our aim is foremost to have fun telling stories about treasure hunters venturing into dangerous places. Secondly, I’m using this short series as a time to get my GM legs for Trophy Gold, and this is a good opportunity for new players to learn the game.

Trophy Gold is not quite as much a “play to lose” game as Trophy Dark is, and I am specifically hoping to see treasure hunters try to progress in building their hoard and story.

## Tone

We will be playing in a somewhat dark fantasy world. The world is dangerous, and character death is possible. The source material is from Mӧrk Borg which can be dark and gross.

## Safety

We will use Lines &amp; Veils, x-card, and the open door policy. This game will adhere to the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

System: Trophy Gold

Time: Fridays in April, 8 PM US Eastern

Technology: Zoom and Roll With Me.

Recording: I will record the sessions and will post them only with everyone&#39;s permission

More info will be sent by email one week before first game.
