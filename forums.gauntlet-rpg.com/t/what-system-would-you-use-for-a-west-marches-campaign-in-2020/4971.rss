    <description>I say 2020 both because there&#39;s been a lot of new additions to the OSR and OSR-adjacent space in the past couple of years and also because I want to assume we&#39;ll be playing online.

I&#39;m personally interested in something in the D&amp;D-adjacent realm (ie, should be compelling to new players who want to &quot;play D&amp;D&quot;) but feel free to discuss good options other genres too!

If you&#39;re trying to help me find my ideal answer, I&#39;d also love a game that has extremely simple character creation but also enough variation that all the lvl 1 PCs don&#39;t look more-or-less identical.</description>

<p>I’m torn between doing 5e D&amp;D (system I’m more familiar with, and what some folks just want to play) or Black Hack 2e for simplicity. Hadn’t even considered Quest for it but might have to take it off the shelf and see how it’d work!</p>

<p>That sounds like the GLOG to me. Have a look at Skerples’ version: <a href="https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html</a></p>
<p>I play The Black Hack 2e myself, and can recommend it for ease of use and accessibility. It only has the four traditional classes out of the box but the background system actually allows for quite a bit of flexibility in “reskinning” them.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t playing TBH2e I’d either be doing White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventure Game for something equally simple but closer to the OD&amp;D source material, or indeed, the GLOG for something more flexible.</p>
<p>I final recommendation is to have a look at <a class="mention" href="/u/dylan_r">@Dylan_R</a>’s home-brew system, which he posted here: <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/why-do-you-use-the-osr-system-you-use/76/7" class="inline-onebox">Why do you use the OSR system you use?</a></p>

              <p>I’ve been thinking about this since March, and I’m going to try Ironsworn. It will be 5~7 so it’s not grand scale but players can play by their own, or together, and sometimes someone in a different part of the continent can jump in as GM. That player driven exploration is what appeals to me about West Marches, and the rules book is free! so players can take it on their own.</p>
<p>I tweaked my Ironlands already and some of my regular players have shown interest, if we do it I’ll let you know how went.</p>

              <p>Are you looking for a modern era OSR game? Or just one that is available to the modern gamer?</p>
<p>Anyway, my answers would be related. There’s this light weight fantasy RPG called Knave, just six pages long, but the characters do feel very different from eachother. And it follows the central tropes of OSR rules, so it is easy to  bring in modules, monsters and stuff from other games.</p>
<p>I used it to build Kuf, my horror RPG about modern day people who get involved with, well, Narniaesque scenarios and ritual magic.</p>

              <p>Oh, absolutely. Nothing in the game is particularly dependent on the collaborative worldbuilding. You can just have folks roll up their characters and skip that part. There is a move called “Establish” that gives players some agency in adding details to the world, but if you prefer your word as GM to be final on setting details, you can just ignore that move.</p>

              <p>Freebooters on the Frontier is definitely at the top of my list right now. I’ve been itching to play it since 1e and have never had the opportunity!</p>

              <p>Thanks for the nod, <a class="mention" href="/u/darren">@darren</a>!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/samr">@SamR</a>, the 2nd edition of <em>Freebooters</em> is in open playtesting, and you can find the current rules and playbooks <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p88e7exekcb0qsa/AACDXT11NSfNsy_VtQS51xDca?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. My three biggest influences in making this game were my experience playing OD&amp;D using Judges Guild material back in the late 70s, the <em>DCC RPG</em>, and Ben Robbins’ blogposts about his West Marches campaign.</p>
<p>Also, <a class="mention" href="/u/chrisshorb">@chrisshorb</a> recently had some ideas about how to adapt the collaborative worldbuilding aspect of <em>Freebooters</em> to a WM-style game, in case you choose to go that route.</p>

<p>I’ll also suggest <a href="http://adventure.game">Quest</a> (and they’re publishing a “campaign” that is essentially West Marches)!</p>

              <p>I mean, here on the Gauntlet, a lot of people will suggest <a href="https://trophyrpg.com/">Trophy Gold</a>. And rightly so! It’s got extremely quick character creation that generates varied and wild PCs. <a href="http://character.totalpartykill.ca/trophy/">Take it for a whirl here.</a></p>

              <p>I say 2020 both because there’s been a lot of new additions to the OSR and OSR-adjacent space in the past couple of years and also because I want to assume we’ll be playing online.</p>
<p>I’m personally interested in something in the D&amp;D-adjacent realm (ie, should be compelling to new players who want to “play D&amp;D”) but feel free to discuss good options other genres too!</p>
<p>If you’re trying to help me find my ideal answer, I’d also love a game that has extremely simple character creation but also enough variation that all the lvl 1 PCs don’t look more-or-less identical.</p>
