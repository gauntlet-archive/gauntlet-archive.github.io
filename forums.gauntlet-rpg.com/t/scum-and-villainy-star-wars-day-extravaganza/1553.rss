    <description>STAR WARS DAY EXTRAVAGANZA

For many years fans of Star Wars have held May 4th as a day to celebrate the franchise.  To celebrate the juggernaut of Nerd Culture we will be playing three sessions of Scum and Villainy set in the Star Wars Universe on this day.

We will be playing a total of 3 three hour sessions of Scum and Villainy on the 4th May using Roll20 and Google Hangouts.  There will be minimal setup for this session and we will be using Pre-generated characters.  These sessions will be recorded for Youtube.

The stories told in these sessions are linked but the ability to play in all sessions is not required.  These sessions are meant for everybody to experience and celebrate Star Wars.  I would ask that people sign up for a single session initially.  If there are any spaces left as of the 17th if April, i will then open these for people to sign up for multiple sessions.

May the Force be with you.

Episode I

CHILDREN OF THE REBELLION

The horror of the destruction of Alderaan by the first DEATHSTAR has sent shock waves around the galaxy.  Erstwhile supporters of THE EMPIRE have finally been exposed to the horrors it brings.

For several months Duke Tannet, ruler of the planet Bethuun, has been in talks with the REBEL ALLIANCE to give their support but these talks have been placed in jeopardy by the kidnapping of Tannet&#39;s children.

But hope still remains as the ALLIANCE dispatches a cell of agents to rescue the children and in doing so, bring Bethuun into the rebellion.

Episode II

GHOSTS OF MANDALORE

The Destruction of Echo base on the Ice world of HOTH has left the REBEL ALLIANCE fleeing the triumphant EMPIRE.  While brave men and women flock to their banner, these heroic warriors can not fight without the weapons to do so.

On the planet Bethuun, the alliance has discovered that the rich industrialist Kolan Nog has just won a contract from the empire to scrap a fleet of GAUNTLET STARFIGHTERS that have been surrendered by Governor Gar Saxon of Mandalore.

Desperate for more weapons to aid their fight, the REBEL ALLIANCE dispatches a cell of rebels to find the location of the freighter which carries them

Episode III

STALKING THE SHADOW

Still pursued by the fleets of The EMPIRE after their defeat at HOTH, the REBEL FLEET has scattered to find solace in any port they may call friend.

The Blockade runner Shadowdancer had set out for the planet of Bethuun after rescuing a ship carrying Alderaian refugees.  There has been no sign of it since.

Fearing for the brave soldiers and civilians aboard,  rebel command has sent a ship to investigate it&#39;s last known position.  But time is fading fast and with it, any hope to find and rescue those still aboard.
