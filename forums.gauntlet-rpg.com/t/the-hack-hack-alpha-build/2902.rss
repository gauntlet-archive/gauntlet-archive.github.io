    <description>Hardboiled fantasy gaming, by way of *Macchiatto Monsters* and *Trophy*

---

#### Basics

- Standard six stats, 2D10K1 in order

- RUIN tracks from 1 (standard stress) to 6 (narratively fatal), a la **Cthulhu Dark**

- Start with LUCK resource at D8 and two other resources of your choice at D6 (such as &quot;damned persistent&quot; or &quot;flirt for the crowd&quot;); when rolled these decay on 1-3

- when outcome is in doubt, roll D12: =&lt;STAT succeeds; =&lt;RUIN complicates; &gt;STAT failure (which also triggers **RUIN ROLL**)

- players may instead opt to roll a resource dice =&lt;STAT rather than D12 (these decay to next lower dice type on 1-3)

- **RUIN ROLL** roll D6: &gt;RUIN, increase RUIN by 1; at six, PC taken out of action

- when a resource decays, lower RUIN by 1 (minimum one) 

#### Antagonists

- Foes described by HD#. They&#39;ve a resource dice equal to twice their HD (min D4, max D12).

- Successful actions against foes triggers their resource dice to be rolled (decays on 1-3). If PC rolls =&lt; foe HD, this roll also counts as a RUIN ROLL. Foes whose resource dice decay fully are at PC mercy.

- Unopposed enemy action causes automatic RUIN ROLL.

#### Cases

- PCs offered cases, with actionable outcome (Y/N) and reward of resource at D8 (either physical (&quot;blunderbuss D8&quot;) or societal (&quot;favour of Sondheim D8&quot;)</description>
