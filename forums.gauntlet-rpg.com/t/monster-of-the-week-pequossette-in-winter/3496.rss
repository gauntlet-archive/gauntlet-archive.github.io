    <description>**Monster of the Week-- Pequossette in Winter** **Tuesdays in November at 8 PM Eastern** Pequossette, MA, a quiet beach town connected to the North Shore of Massachusetts by a single road on a narrow spit of land, especially in winter when the tourists pack up and head home.  But lately, strange things have started to happen around Pequossette, or PQ as it is affectionately known by locals.  Nobody&#39;s quite ready to talk about what they are yet, not above a whisper, but in a town this small, everybody seems to know about them.  Seems they&#39;re all really worried what might happen when the first big storm shuts down Neck Road, and cuts the town off from the mainland...

These are 4 sessions of Monster of the Week, Michael Sand&#39;s PbtA game patterned on television serials like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the X-Files and Supernatural.  We will be playing a fairly open game in the setting discussed above, a fictional beach town on the North Shore of Massachusetts in the off-season.  Session one will be taken up with character creation, as well as collaboratively filling out the setting and beginning the first mystery.  After that, we&#39;ll play to find out what happens.

In addition to the core book, we will be using @jexjthomas&#39; modified basic move triggers.  The alternate weird moves from Tome of Mysteries will be available, should players want them, as well as the additional playbooks.

We will be using the X-card and Brie-Beau Sheldon&#39;s script change tools. For more information on the Gauntlet&#39;s safety tools, please refer to our Inclusivity Policy on the website (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
