    <title>Are dice cool?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/are-dice-cool/7858</link>
    <description>Is rolling actual dice generally looked upon favorably (or not) when playing on the Gauntlet?  I played two four session series a few years ago and the dice rolling was handled digitally.  I’m thinking about rejoining in w the gauntlet community and am wondering if there is an established norm. 

Thanks so much,
Davey.

              <p>Thanks Sandy. I’m definitely into diceless games. I was a DnD and traveller nerd kid in the late 70s and early 80s but when I got back into rpgs around a decade ago it was via a group that played only gmLess and usually dice less games (story games seattle). I’m fact I think all of my own designs are diceless!<br>
Thx for your feedback!<br>
Davey</p>

              <p>Basically what Sandy said – it’s fun to sortof ‘share’ in the excitement of ‘watching’ the dice, and some of that is lost in online play if someone is rolling physical dice that I have no way of seeing.</p>
<p>In general though, while I think online dice rolling is “the norm” I think it’s also up to each individual GM.</p>

              <p>I can’t speak for everyone, but I love dice and generally prefer games that use them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are a bunch of diceless games I love (Good Society, i’m sorry did you say street magic, Dream Askew).</p>
<p>Oh wait I realised you’re asking about physical dice! In online games, I prefer digital dice rollers because I like the excitement of waiting on the result and all seeing what number comes up at the same time. If a player prefers to roll a physical dice for some reason - like, I played a game recently where one of the players was using a dice that didn’t support the dice roller we were using - that’s fine with me. I’d say online dice rollers are the norm for Gauntlet games.</p>
