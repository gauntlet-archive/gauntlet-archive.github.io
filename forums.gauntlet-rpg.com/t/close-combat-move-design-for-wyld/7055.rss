    <description>I&#39;ve been unsatisfied with the close combat move for Wyld for a while, and I ran a quick playtest of it and identified some problems. Here&#39;s the previous move:

---

## Fight in Close Combat (Old)

To fight your enemies up close and personal you will exchange harm, but first roll +Might.

On a 16+ choose 3. On an 11-15 choose 2. On a miss choose 1. If your enemy is a PC they roll as well, if an NPC the GM chooses 1 on a hit, 2 on a miss.

* You attack aggressively, inflict 1 more harm.
* You defend effectively, suffer 1 less harm.
* You gain the advantage: take +1 forward, or give +1 forward to an ally
* You force them where you want them
* You seize or hold some objective by force
* You win free and get away
* You force your way through
* You protect someone from harm. As long as they remain within reach of you, they have 1-armour against the next blow they take.

If you have a protective weapon such as a shield you may choose to suffer less harm more than once.

If you have a brutal weapon such as most 2-handed weapons, you may choose to inflict severe harm more than once.

If you are using a light weapon, you can choose to roll+Grace instead of +Might.

---

The problems are several, but the main one was that if you&#39;re clearly losing, and your opponent is almost certainly about to finish you off, you can chose a tactical goal and there&#39;s nothing your opponent can do to stop you. This is actually a feature of Seize By Force in AW as well, but is a little less of a problem as if you&#39;re dead most of the options are not relevant (you win free but youre dead?). But this move is trying to do more tactical work. So here&#39;s my revised version.

---

## Fight in Close Combat (New)

To fight your enemies up close and personal you will exchange harm, but first roll +Might. On a 16+ hold 3. On an 11-15 hold 2. On a miss hold 1. If your enemy is a PC they roll as well, if an NPC the GM gets 1 hold on a hit, 2 on a miss.

Each side chooses how to spend their hold secretly, 1-for-1 on the following options:

* Inflict severe harm (+1 harm)
* Suffer less harm (-1 harm)
* You gain the advantage: take +2 forward, or give +2 forward to an ally
* You protect someone or something within your reach from harm, they take -1 harm.
* You aim to achieve a tactical goal.

Any tactical goal must be chosen from below when the hold is spent. If both sides choose a tactical goal, either may give up their goal in order to counter their opponent’s choice of goal instead.

* You force them where you want them
* You seize or hold some objective by force
* You win free and get away
* You force your way through

If you have a protective weapon such as a shield you may spend hold to suffer less harm more than once.

If you have a brutal weapon such as most 2-handed weapons, you may spend your hold to inflict severe harm more than once.

If you are using a light weapon, you can choose to roll+Grace instead of +Might.

It&#39;s a bit of a beast, but it seems to achieve better what I&#39;m aiming for. Is it clear what the intent is though? Any options you think are missing, or ambiguity?</description>

              <p>That’s the main reason yes, the 2D6 curve mean you can’t go beyond +4 modifiers without running out of runway. Looking at Apocalypse World, stats go up to +3 and bonuses from e.g. Help or Interfere go up to +2. Well a +5 modifier makes it impossible to miss.</p>
<p>I had some game mechanical ideas that would provide additional bonuses, but I may well go back to 2D6 is it turns out the extra headroom isn’t useful.</p>

              <p>That’s a good point, it should be +2. I’ll edit the post. I’m still on the fence about going with 2D10 to be honest. My plan is to play test for a while with that and see how it goes as I think it will require some tweaking to modifiers, but I’ve always got the option to go back to 2D6.</p>
<p>So there is no protect someone move at the moment, it’s just an option you can take in Close Combat, or you can Aid/Support someone in combat. However there is a problem here, the best you can get in And or Support is +2, but if you can grant that just as one option in Close Combat that seems too powerful.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Aid or Support</h2>
<p>When you assist another character making a move, roll+Grace.</p>
<p>On a 16+, your assistance grants them +3 to their roll.</p>
<p>On an 11-15, your aid grants them +2 to their roll, or you may grant them +3 if you expose yourself to risk or peril in doing so.</p>

              <p>This is a little bit of a nitpick, but do you find that players EVER pick the “+1 forward” option? Even in standard PbtA, I feel like this option is really weak and only chosen if the players basically have an “extra” pick that they don’t care about.  In your game with the 2-20 scale, +1 forward feels REALLY underpowered compared to other stuff and should probably be at least +2 just to maintain parity with how strong it is in a 2d6 game.</p>
<p>Also, how does the “protect someone, they take -1 harm” option work?  Does this move do double duty as the “defend” move?</p>
