    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2022/10/31/crowdfunding-collection-202/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #202, including every tabletop rpg project started between 10/23 and 10/30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The collection is back to the weekly rythm and hence features a more digestible amount of projects.

&lt;b&gt;Heist – The Roleplaying Game&lt;/b&gt; is one project that immediatly caught my attention. The games is inspired by movies like Ocean’s 11, series like Better Call Saul and videogames like the GTA series of games. As that’s quite a broad field, even as it tends to focus on the lighter aspects of the genre, the focus on the various aspects does vary, Though the cooperative creation of the setting should aid the group in adjusting it to their taste. Systemwise it uses a 2d10 system, which works with set difficulties and considers the margin of how close or how much above one managed to roll. The general design approach is to have the system support the game, and offering enough room to be unobstrusive during play. The game is available in English and German, and I do recommen having a look.
I did as well consider &lt;b&gt;Diapers &amp; Daycares&lt;/b&gt; as I like the parody presented, yet am hestitating as the small book delivery is focused to the US and am not entirely sure how long the idea would entertainment. Another interesting project is the &lt;b&gt;Eye To The Void&lt;/b&gt; sourcebook, offering insight into various Divination approaches and how to use them for a game.
There are of couse many more interesting projects, like the ttrpg about trans-human stories or a new edition of Paranoia or the charcuterie dice that poked my appetite. Just have a look and decide for yourself which projects fit your interests:
