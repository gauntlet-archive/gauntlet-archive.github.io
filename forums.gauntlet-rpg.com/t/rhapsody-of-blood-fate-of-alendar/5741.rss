Fate of Alendar

Saturdays in October at 7 PM CST

Welcome to the Queendom of Alendar, a country that has been rotting from the inside. We will start at the start of the monarchy&#39;s decline – the timeline where Princess Lux ended up corrupted by the Castle&#39;s promises.

Alendar is a country in the vein of media such as Tecmo&#39;s Deception, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Castlevania (game + show). This will be dark Victoriana in the vein of dark, dreary, and morbid. Shadows creep around the corners, people run scared as the Castle of the Damned returns to the world. This is a game that makes you put trust in Pandora&#39;s final gift while cursing her for giving it to you at the same time.

Your Bloodlines have stood up to the Regent before and are called to do so again. Send off an Explorer to delve into the new Castle to save the world...or die trying.

This is the October run. Depending on timing and inclination there may be a second Generation in November.

Themes will include: Decaying hierarchy, mourning/grief, terror/gothic horror, exploration, corruption, fantasy, and loss.
