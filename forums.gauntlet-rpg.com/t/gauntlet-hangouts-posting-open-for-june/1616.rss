    <title>Gauntlet Hangouts Posting Open for June</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-hangouts-posting-open-for-june/1616</link>
    <description>Since we’ve moved into April, GMs can now post Gauntlet Hangout sessions for June (?!). But we still have plenty of room for sessions in May as well. As a reminder, you should schedule sessions a minimum of two weeks out, with one week for Patron access. I’ve seen a few GMs recently shaving days off of that. Please don’t. 

GM’s if you’re thinking about what to run, consider asking for suggestions. In the past that’s pointed me to a couple of games that I might not have thought of otherwise. Also take a look at sign ups; games with large waitlists suggest there’s a hunger for that system. 

If you have questions about running, feel free to message me. I’d be glad to answer those. If you’ve played in a couple of Gauntlet Hangouts sessions and want to run, I’m also the person to contact about that. You can see more about that process in the [Gauntlet Community FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t1Y1uKjzSfC7Mb12GrlONPHSzTGrYoMtv3KZgDyMVIQ/edit?usp=sharing).</description>
