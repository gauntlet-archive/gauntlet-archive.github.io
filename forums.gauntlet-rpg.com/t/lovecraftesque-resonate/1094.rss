This game is on [date=2019-05-05 time=16:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot;] and is scheduled for four hours. The session will be recorded, and uploaded to YouTube with the consent of all participants. Lovecraftesque is a collaborative storytelling game designed to create brooding cosmic horror in the vein of HP Lovecraft, but free of the weight of the Mythos and its sometimes problematic content.

This session we will play with the Resonate scenario by Graham Walmsley. The Witness is Luis Alvarez, a former soldier of a quasi-military governmental organisation that fought to suppress Mythos threats. After a failed operation, the force was disbanded. To forget the organisation that abandoned him and the fight that is no longer his, Luis is losing himself in the New York disco scene, abandoning himself to drugs, sex and dance.

The game will be played in accordance with the [The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html), and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in play. Lovecraftesque is a game about horror, and we are likely to deal with some disturbing themes. These include existential dread, despair, mental health issues, violence and body horror. This scenario specifically deals with gay nightlife in the New York disco scene of the 70s/80s, and sexuality and drug use will feature. We will have a discussion on content including lines and veils before we begin play.
