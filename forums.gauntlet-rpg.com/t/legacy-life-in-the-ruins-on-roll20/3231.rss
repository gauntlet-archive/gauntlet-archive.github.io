    <title>Legacy Life in the Ruins on Roll20</title>

    <description>Been playing around with Roll20 to use with Legacy:  Life in the ruins and i have to say, i&#39;m pretty damn impressed with the map making tools.

Anybody else used it for map making before?

example below.

![legacy%20map%202|506x500](upload://9UQvjhyoCKi0beIhBkm335E60nS.png)

Each of the assets above will let me drop a banner naming them under them and by double clicking on them i can add notes to them.  I suspect this is going to make housekeeping and record keeping so much easier.</description>

              <p>Normally in Roll20 you are correct, only the GM can add tokens or assets to the canvas. You could set up a “palette” area to the side and add them there, then give players control of them and let them move things around. Alternatively they can use the drawing tools rather than tokens.</p>

              <p>How do you allow the players the ability to add things and modify the map? I know they can freehand, but I’ve always found it annoying that only the GM can drop art assets in.</p>
