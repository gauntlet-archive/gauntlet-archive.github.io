    <title>Codex Time 2 - Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-time-2-miscellany/7946</link>
    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Time 2. This one is called “Three Dozen MORE In Medias Res Starters.” It’s a sequel to the one published in the original Codex - Time.

Getting the action going by putting characters right in the middle of an event is a classic story telling (and GMing) technique. Tell us your favorite go-to scenario that you have come up with, or invent a new one as you are inspired by other entries!

Note: please avoid sexist imagery in your submissions—we don’t publish stuff like that.

Submissions should be no more than 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Here is the original “Three Dozen In Medias Res Starters” https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_-YSi_5savEJIvnXk914F6tUgG-UUA3B/view?usp=sharing

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).</description>

You need them for the spell to break the Kitsay dynasty’s hold on your land and bring them to heel. You lift the lid on the sarcophagus, but feel a dry hand touch yours. Its the Queen’s hand.

Their caramel voice slides into your ear with an offer of further sensual delights. You know your crew is waiting for you at the space dock, eager to leave before anyone notices the dubious goods in your cargo bay. What do you do?</p>

              <p>Claire was a very good runner and - you thought at the time - an okay friend, but you were eventually glad to break ties with her and you hoped never to see her again. You certainly didn’t expect to see her angrily firing a submachinegun’s entire clip at the rapidly disentegrating van you’re using for cover. At least she’s only wearing pajamas instead of riot gear, but her cyber arm may have some new tricks, and your own clothes - or lack thereof - don’t exactly give you an edge.</p>

              <p>You regain consciousness, suspended upside-down from your crimson boots. You open your eyes and blink back tears from the noxious vapors assailing your nose. You tilt your head back: The fringe of your cape is beginning to dissolve in the vat of sickly green liquid below you. Your hands are lashed behind your back and you can’t reach your utility belt. “Ah, you’re finally coming around!” cackles a familiar voice. You turn your masked face toward your arch enemy, whose hand rests on a comically large yellow lever. “Any last words from my favorite super-hero before your final dip in an acid bath?”</p>
