    <title>Gauntlet Talk: Running TTRPG Mysteries (8/27)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/gauntlet-talk-running-ttrpg-mysteries-8-27/8311</link>
    <description>I have added a discussion on running mysteries in ttrpgs to the Calendar for 8/27 at 1500 US Eastern. Sign up is primarily to gauge interest. 

This session is a seminar to talk about TTRPG mysteries. I will be leading the discussion, but I may also rope in one or two folks to help with the talk.

This session will be 60-90 minutes, with the back half being left to questions and discuss ideas. Anyone’s welcome to join the seminar. I will post a brief outline of possible topics before the session.We might talk about

* Kinds of mysteries (set, set variable, improv)
* Planning mysteries
* The power of the timeline
* Info management
* Keeping player involvement
* Mysteries and problem solving
* Hard framing
* Characters and authorities
* Genres and mysteries
* Gumshoe approach
* Brindlewood Bay approach
* Different mystery games

This session will be recorded, with a plan to convert it to audio to use for The Gauntlet Podcast. Participants may choose to leave their camera off and stay muted—questions/responses can be done via chat.

This seminar will follow the Community Code of Conduct. If you have questions (or if you want to participate as a speaker) you can message me.
