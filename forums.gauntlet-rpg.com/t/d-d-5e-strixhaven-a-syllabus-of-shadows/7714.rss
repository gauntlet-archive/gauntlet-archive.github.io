    <description>***A fantasy school of magic!***

This is for the first of eight sessions of  *Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition*  set in the MTG world of Strixhaven running Monday evenings 9PM US Eastern in March and April. Characters will begin at 2nd level—classes from the *Players Handbook* with add-ons from *Strixhaven: Curriculum of Chaos* will be in play. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged, but not really required.

General sign up opens 1/4

I will provide access to the Strixhaven material add-ons in a compendium. While the rules will be taught, recognize these are a little crunchier than the standard Gauntlet fare. OOH I tend to streamline things in play, so if you’re a stickler for rules accuracy—this may not be the game for you. Some familiarity with the Strixhaven setting would be helpful—even just skimming a wikipage about the various guilds.

You’re welcome to put together your character ahead of time (once we’ve confirmed class picks). I will also have a set of pre-gens ready, one for each class not already chosen by a player. Note that we may modify racial picks and feats.

We will be using Roll20 for maps and character keeper—it’s just easier that way. You can use that roller or another. But we will be using Zoom for the video meeting. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
