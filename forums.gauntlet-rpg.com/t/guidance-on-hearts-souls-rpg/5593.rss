    <title>Guidance on Hearts &amp; Souls RPG?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/guidance-on-hearts-souls-rpg/5593</link>
    <description>Hi,

Heard about Hearts &amp; Souls on the latest Gauntlet Podcast and picked it up. So far I like the premise a great deal. Want to run a supers game that is less crunchy than Champions/Hero Systems.

I am a little confused as to how some things like character creation works. It seems to be: just have an idea and flesh it out with your GM (or Editor as the game calls it). Is this correct? There isn&#39;t a more structured method? Guidance for how many attributes should be ordinary, human, superhuman, exceptional, etc..  Tried looking up reviews or playthroughs but &quot;Hearts and Souls&quot; gets a lot of results that are not related to the RPG at all.

BTW the version I picked up is this one from Drivethru RPG:
https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/3310/Hearts--Souls

Is that the correct/latest version?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!</description>

<p>Yup, that’s how it works. Just come up with a concept that fits in the frame of the comic and assign mechanics as you see fit, working with the GM.</p>
