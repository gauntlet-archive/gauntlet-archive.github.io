    <title>Bluebeard&#39;s Bride - Book of Mirrors</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/bluebeards-bride-book-of-mirrors/134</link>
    <description>Bluebeard&#39;s Bride was definitely one of my favorite games of 2018. The few times I got a chance to run and play it, I had such a wonderful time. I love the construction of the game and the very specific story it&#39;s telling, but how it handles so differently in the hands of different MCs. 

I&#39;m still really excited about the [Book of Mirrors supplement](https://www.magpiegames.com/2019/01/24/masks-unbound-now-available-as-pdf-and-pre-order/) for Bluebeard&#39;s Bride. I&#39;ve been pestering my F2F group about playing either the Bluebeard&#39;s Legacy setting or the Condemned Asylum setting. 

Has anyone had a chance to play any of the new settings yet?</description>
