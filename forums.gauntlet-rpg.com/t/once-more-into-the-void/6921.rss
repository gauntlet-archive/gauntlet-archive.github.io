    <description>This is a run of [Once More Into the Void](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/once-more-into-the-void), a game about the disbanded crew of a starship coming back together for one final by [Jamila Nedjadi](https://twitter.com/temporalhiccup) of Sword Queen games. It is shortly to be kickstarted in conjunction with [Genesis of Legend Publishing](https://twitter.com/Genesisoflegend) - this was announced as I was preparing to set this up, initial info can be found [here](https://genesisoflegend.com/2021/05/announcing-once-more-into-the-void/). There will be three sessions, and sessions will be three hours in length. Due to the nature of the game and its focus on relationships in the crew, it is best played with a consistent cast, so I would ask players to sign up only if they can make a good-faith commitment to make all three sessions. In the event of a player having to drop part way through the series, I may then recruit from the waitlist. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (May 7th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants. This may include being shared as part of promotion around the kickstarter.

We were comrades, we were family.

We were once the heroes of this galaxy. We stood against the tide of darkness and prevailed, again and again. We were comrades, we were family.

But our family fell apart. Our shared past is full of shame, trespasses, and secrets. We parted ways, vowing to never see each other again.

And now, our greatest enemy has returned. Manipulating from the shadows, they grow stronger than ever. No one else believes the threat is real. Only the Captain has a chance at defeating this enemy, once and for all.

The Captain will have to bring the crew back together again. But will they go with them into the void once more? Can the crew trust the Captain again, who left disappointment and heartbreak in their wake?

Once More Into the Void is a game based on MF0: Firebrands by Vincent and Meguey Baker, inspired by Star Trek: Picard and Mass Effect 2. The play focuses on a series of mini-games as the former crewmates are recruited back to the team by the Captain, train together, re-hash unfinished business, and finally face down their enemy in a fight they may not all return from. It is a collaborative game with no GM role, though I will be facilitating play. 

Content Warnings:  This is a game that focuses on military action against a terrible foe, and as such violence and loss are key themes in the game. Past, probably tense and frayed, relationships between the crew are central to the game, and there is the possibility of an element of betrayal. Romantic relationships may also feature. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
