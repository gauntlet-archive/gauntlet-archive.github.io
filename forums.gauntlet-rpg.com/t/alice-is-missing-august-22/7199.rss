    <description>For the first 24 hours, please sign up only if you have never played Alice is Missing before.

Alice is Missing is a silent role-playing game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town of Silent Falls.

After character creation, the game is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually. They explore their relationships with each other and Alice while also trying to figure out where Alice may be. The game regularly creates new information and plot events through the use of card reveals that occur at scheduled times.

CONTENT &amp; TRIGGER WARNINGS

Alice is Missing inherently deals with topics of lack of agency, death, grief, helplessness, loss, tense family dynamics, and violence. Player discretion is advised.

Media Touchstones: Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, Firewatch, Searching

Safety Tools: X-Card, Lines and Veils, Open Door

Code of Conduct: This event adheres to the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct

Technology: Roll20 (card management), Discord (text), and Zoom (briefing/debrief).

Recording: This session will not be recorded.

Seats saved for Donogh and Darin R.

I will send links and further information in an email one week before the game. Please check your SPAM folder if you don&#39;t see anything from me by then.

RSVPs open to all on 7/21 at 6:00pm CDT.
