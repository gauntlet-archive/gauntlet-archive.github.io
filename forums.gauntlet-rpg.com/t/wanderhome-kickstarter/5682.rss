    <description>Does anyone know much about this Kickstarter? Animal folk wandering around helping each other and herding giant bumble bees. Seems and looks pretty adorable, but I don’t know much more about it.

              <p>I’m not surprised that the <em>Wanderhome</em> kickstarter met its goal within hours, but it testifies to the energy in the indie TTRPG community that it’s now at $60,000 and could make 100k by the campaign’s end.</p>
<p>I looked through the playkit and I enjoyed the coziness and how the mechanics reinforce that tone. I hope it ends up being a strong work in the Belonging Outside Belonging genre.</p>

              <p>Mainly what you’ve told me: that they’re a good team likely to deliver a good game. Thank you!</p>
<p>I’ve really been looking for some more non-violent games to use as as an introduction to gaming for several folk and this looks like it could have potential. That’s a really long delivery time though!</p>

              <p>Same—I’ve been following Jay’s work for a while, and read through the preview kit (but haven’t had a chance to play yet). The game itself, in the BOB family tree, looks super sweet, and I am super excited to see what the final product looks like. Backed it as soon as I could, and I’m eagerly awaiting the goodies. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>Yeah, I’ve been looking forward to this one for a while now, and am excited to see it launch! What kind of info were you wondering about? If rules, you can get a good feel for the game with the <a href="https://jdragsky.itch.io/wanderhome" rel="nofollow noopener">preview playkit</a>, free to download! If you’re wondering about reliability, I have full confidence in the designer and it’s a pretty crackerjack team they’ve got goin’ on there.</p>
