    <title>Supporting the FLGS</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/supporting-the-flgs/1487</link>
    <description>As a rule i try and support that local game store that runs rpg sessions most weeknights in Nottingham when i do an rpg purchase.  That said, i&#39;ve tried ordering some of the Indy books that are popular on the gauntlet through them and it&#39;s been hard going.   No matter what they have tried they have not been able to get hold of the games (particularly PBTA games) when i&#39;ve tried to order them.

Am i right in thinking that most distributors do not carry hard copies of indy games?</description>

              <p>We got our comic store to carry more indie games by asking him to stock them, offering to run showcases of them, and pointing him at IPR (who are very friendly to small retailers with small orders.)

<p>In the beginning, I’d get him to order 1 or 2 copies of a bunch of games and say, “I can’t afford all of these right now, but if copies are still there in a month or two, I’ll snatch it up.”</p>

              <p>As a publisher, I can only reinforce what others here have said. Most indie games don’t sell in numbers significant enough to be carried by the larger distributors (Alliance, ACD, Asmodee, etc) so Indie Press Revolution is the best bet for a game store that wants to carry those titles. It would be great if someone started a similar operation in the UK, but for now Leisure Games and a handful of other game stores are your best bet.</p>

I haven’t ordered anything through them, but I would imagine they’d be able to get in just about anything–though of course I can’t say for sure! With the caveat that I have no actual insight into how book distribution really works, it seems like it must be something to do with which distributors publishers have deals with, and which ones the stores have deals with. But I’m sure someone hear knows how that works much better than I do!</p>

<p>On the more general question, and again from a UK perspective: IPR distribute to some UK stores eg Leisure Games. Asmodee carry some indie titles but they’re pretty half-assed about it. And beyond that manufacturers have to go direct go retailers (hence my question above).</p>
