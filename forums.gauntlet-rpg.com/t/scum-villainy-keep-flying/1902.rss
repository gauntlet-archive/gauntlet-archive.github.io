    <description>You are the crew of a spaceship, trying to keep flying and make ends meet while under the iron-fisted rule of the Galactic Hegemony.  You are in the Procyon sector, on the far edge of known space.  This far out, there is less of a Hegemonic presence, and local powers include pirate queens, criminal syndicates and legitimate corporate interests.  Your crew takes what jobs it can, both legal and illegal.  Can your crew thrive amid the threats from powerful space syndicates, warring noble families, dangerous aliens, strange mystics, ruins of lost civilizations and your crew&#39;s own vices?

Each session will be three hours. Attendance at all four sessions is encouraged, but not required.  You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Rules will be taught. Sessions will be recorded. 

We will have a pregame discussion of lines and veils as well as employ the X-card during sessions. We will observe the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy.
