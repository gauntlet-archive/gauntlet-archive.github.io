    <description>**GLW is Hitting the Road**
Run by Tyler Lominack

In an effort to find new fans, GLW is touring small towns across the United States. New talent, grizzled vets, and indy darlings are all hoping to find a way onto the main roster and a shot at the big time. The road ain&#39;t easy and the venues aren&#39;t glamorous, but the only way to the top is to pay your dues. Pull on your tights, lace up your boots.....And Let&#39;s Get Ready To RUUUMMMBLE!!!!

We will be playing World Wide Wrestling 1st ed, a PBTA game about Pro Wrestling, and using The Road expansion. This will be 5 sessions and we will have 5 players (One seat is reserved) and will create wrestlers in the first session. No experience needed, the game will be taught as we go. There will be a discussion of tone, the X-Card will be on the table, and we will have a lines and veils in effect.

**CW:**  Certain themes will be on the table including: drug use, feelings of isolation, and the effects on family from long absences.

Attendance for all sessions is not required but is preferred.
