<p>While Gauntlet forums is basically open to all sorts indie/story games, it tends to heavily navigate towards PbtA.</p>
<p>I’d be also happy to know additional places with a broader range of game systems/mechanics and also a stronger focus on game design.<br>
Maybe Reddit?</p>

<p>I know there is an “Indie RPGs” Discord channel, although I really don’t like Discord for long-form conversations about games (endlessly frustrating!), so I don’t go there. Adept Play is Ron Edwards’ new site, and it has a bunch of activity, as well (on the site and on Discord).</p>
<p>This is the best place I’m aware of, although the “story game” focus is heavily, heavily dominated by PbtA games (which might be a plus or a minus, depending on your interests).</p>
