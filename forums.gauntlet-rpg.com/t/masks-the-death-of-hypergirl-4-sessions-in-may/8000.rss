    <title>Masks: The Death of Hypergirl (4 sessions in May)</title>

    <description>The unexpected death of Hypergirl, one of Halcyon City’s greatest heroes, has left the super community reeling. But as a teen hero just finding your feet, you’re in for an even bigger shock when you find out she’s left you her legendary Hyper-Cave, packed with dazzling (and deadly!) superscience devices and baffling cosmic curios. What an opportunity! But can you handle the many doubters, hero and villain alike, who would like to take it from you? And—oh no,  *why is the Hyper-Alarm ringing like*  ***that*** *???*

Masks is a pbta game about teenage superheroes trying to figure out who they really are in a world of difficult expectations, contradictory influences, and powerful supervillains. No rules knowledge is required, and all rules will be taught in play. 

In this game I’ll aim for a Silver Age-y vibe of high-octane impossibility driven by melodrama and the power of friendship. The game should stay pretty PG, but is likely to include mild comic book violence, romantic dynamics and teen angst. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

Attendance at all sessions is encouraged but not required. Please sign up for all sessions you&#39;d like to attend. 

Sessions will run over Zoom with a short break on the hour, and I don&#39;t intend to record them. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged but not required. Please sign up for all sessions you&#39;d like to attend.  

I’ll email players a week before the first session to confirm attendance and share play materials. 

Open access time for sign ups will be 6pm 7/4/22 AEST.
