    <description>Hey folks!

In this post, we will highlight games for the upcoming week which have open seats and therefore the opportunity to add some more gaming fun to your week.

### [Exodus: What Comes After Hallelujah ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-L_3YGFruLsmv1FSZfjB)

[date=2019-04-15 time=14:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-15 time=17:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
[Exodus](https://fadingroots.itch.io/exodus) is a game by Erika Shepherd about a road trip from hell to someplace else, of angels running from a fascist dystopia, making community as they go, trying to find something better. It uses Avery Alder’s Belonging Outside Belonging system, as seen in Dream Askew/Dream Apart and is heavily inspired by Ezra Furman’s Transangelic Exodus. It’s a game rooted in a time, an autobiography and a plan and a dream and a fear all in one. Too many people, today, can imagine having to pick up one day and leave your life behind, to go on the run from a world that has no place for you. Exodus tells that story.

### [Slings &amp;amp; Arrows ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LYU-iTL1RHEDr2dYzs0)

[date=2019-04-16 time=18:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-16 time=21:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
@Mikel_Matthews’ Slings &amp;amp; Arrows is about theatre people and how the show they’re in seeps into their day jobs and personal lives.

### [Lacuna Part 1: The Creation of the Mystery and The Girl from Blue City ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LXpyUiaI1Aetdf2V3Ln)

[date=2019-04-16 time=19:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-16 time=22:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
Lacuna Part 1. The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City is an experimental roleplaying game . . . and you’re part of the experiment whether you realize it or not.

### [The Crimson Shadow of a Golden Cross playtest ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LaMxEnQVIV1cEY0PNpP)

[date=2019-04-16 time=19:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-16 time=22:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
This game is set in an original setting based on the Gothic Horror genre. It is meant to tell stories of religious corruption, class struggle, cultural oppression and grey morality.

### [Mecha Monthly: Armour Astir ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LYNbOMuaJAo_XnhRgKP)

[date=2019-04-18 time=14:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-18 time=17:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
A high-fantasy take on mecha warfare, play as rebellious magicians, fighters, clerics, and forty-foot tall magical constructs called Astirs, caught up in the struggle against an Authority that seeks to control them.

### [Things From The Flood](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LY4N8gW08tlMft6pozF)

[date=2019-04-18 time=20:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-18 time=23:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]  
Things from the Flood is the sequel to Tales from the Loop.  You play Teens in the 1990s – a decade of change and disaster. You&#39;re still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher...

### [Storm Riders: GRUNTS ](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LZfy7GLvG175JONCFoc)

[date=2019-04-18 time=20:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]  
When Freedom is threatened, when Liberty is under siege, when the forces of evil are knocking on your door, that’s when the GRUNTS (General Reserve United Nations Tactical Squad) mobilize! A Gauntlet Comics presentation! We’ll use @Michael_G_Barford’s Storm Riders to recreate the adventures of Solomon Toys’ massively popular 80s military action figures and the associated mega-hit afternoon cartoon (Look to GI Joe, MASK, and Green Plastic Army Men for inspiration).

### [ Ironsworn (Co-op): Tales of the Iron Gauntlet Brotherhood](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-La0laU7OUf-jymF7mId)

[date=2019-04-20 time=8:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] → [date=2019-04-20 time=12:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;] 
You are a hero doing quests between the Iron lands, the territories unclaimed by no clans or civilization. You are a member of the Iron Gauntlet Brotherhood, a loose-confederation of survivors, taking in warriors that outlasted their friends, peoples, bands or units.</description>
