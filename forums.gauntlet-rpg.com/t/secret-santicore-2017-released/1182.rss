    <title>Secret Santicore 2017 Released</title>

    <description>One of the more interesting projects over at G+ pre-collapse was the Secret Santicore. This was a collection of interesting game materials. &quot;Secret Santicore is an annual RPG shared project. Ask for a thing -- a map, a monster, a location, an adventure idea -- and create one for someone else in return. We then put them all together in one place.&quot; It ran for several years. They&#39;ve finally released the compiled 2017 collection for free in pdf format.

My friend Steve Sigety oversaw the layout. It&#39;s a neat volume and actually the first one I&#39;ve looked at. It has some great random generators I&#39;m digging:
* Goblin Shenanigans tables
* d100 Alchemical Accidents
* Whats in the Back of the Old West Store

I&#39;m tempted to go back and look at the earlier volumes of this crowdsourced collection. Any thoughts of those? Has anyone looked through and can recommend one?</description>

              <p>I know this isn’t a super helpful answer, but it’s hard to recommend one over another, because they’re all so varied. I have them all saved somewhere, but although I remember articles I liked I struggle to remember <em>which</em> collection they were in.</p>
