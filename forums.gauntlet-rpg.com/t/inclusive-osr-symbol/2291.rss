<p>Stuart’s logo is the popular OSR as a dungeon map logo people are likely familiar with. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dismastersden/posts/two-new-rainbow-osr-logos-by-stuart-robertsonfree-to-use-under-creative-commons/272521063321158/" rel="nofollow noopener">He made another one with rainbow colours.</a> He got sick of the scene and asked people to stop using his logo, though. But I suspect people using the rainbow logo is something he is cooler with.</p>

              <p>Didn’t S. Robinson do up his logo in a rainbow flag version?  I know he took his logo out of circulation due to OSR reactionaries, but that’s the one I can think of.</p>
