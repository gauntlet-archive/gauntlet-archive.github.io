    <title>The Between: Questions and Opportunities Part Three (Four sessions in August)</title>

    <description>***For the first 48 hours, please only sign up for this game if you&#39;re playing in the July sessions, as this will continue that game. One spot is being saved for a returning player.***

**The Between**  is a tabletop roleplaying game about a group of mysterious monster hunters in Victorian-era London. These hunters learn about various monstrous threats in the city and conduct investigations, or “hunts,” in order to neutralize them. They gradually become aware of the machinations of a criminal mastermind who is sometimes connected to the threats, but always scheming to bring the Crown to its knees.

This game will continue the story from my July game, but if you didn’t play in that game you’ll be fine to jump in. I expect this will be the last part of the series and that the hunters will finally confront the dastardly Mastermind plotting to bring down the Crown...

Rules: The Between is a pbta game with mechanics based on Brindlewood Bay and a unique, formalised play cycle. No rules knowledge is expected and all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter:  **The Between**  is an unavoidably dark game. Murder, cannibalism, body horror, dark sexual themes, threats to children and animals, foul language, blasphemy, witchcraft, and defiling corpses are all things that come up in the game on a fairly regular basis. 

We’ll be using Lines and Veils, the X Card, and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html. 

We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. The sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players. 

Please sign up for all sessions you want to attend. I’ll send a group email before our first session to confirm interest, share play materials, etc. 

Open access time for sign-ups is 10.30am 21/6/21 AEST.
