    <title>[resolved] Looking for Juan Ochoa</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/resolved-looking-for-juan-ochoa/8132</link>
    <description>Hello,
I am looking for Juan Ochoa, a Bogota based artist and world famed RPG illustrator·ix. The name is terribly common and the contact form of their webpage is down. I need their permission to duplicate art for a free fan work translated version of a game. If you know of a way to contact them, please transfer this message or my email adress to them.
Enjoy your day!</description>
