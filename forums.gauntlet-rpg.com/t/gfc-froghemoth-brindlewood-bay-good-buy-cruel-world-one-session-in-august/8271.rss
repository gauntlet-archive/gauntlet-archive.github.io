***Please NOTE: This single-session game is part of Gauntlet Facilitator Camp Froghemoth. All three seats are initially reserved for our camp counselor and fellow campers. Once participants have signed up, the wait list is available for general sign-ups.***

**Brindlewood Bay**  is a tabletop roleplaying game that combines  *Murder, She Wrote*  with H.P. Lovecraft. In it, you play a group of elderly women, members of the local Murder Mavens Mystery Book Club, who help the authorities solve murder cases in a picturesque New England Town. Over the course of their investigations, they become aware of a dark occult conspiracy that connects the cases, and will eventually have to face that conspiracy in order to save their community. 

*&quot;Good Buy, Cruel World&quot;* is a scenario by Michael Van Vleet for  **Brindlewood Bay** ,

The Mavens&#39; mall-walking exercise plans are interrupted by the discovery of a body in the Ambergris Galleria&#39;s central fountain! Was it a suicide? Or are more sinister forces at work? It may take a few circuits around the mall to figure out what&#39;s going on! Get those steps in!
