    <description>Hi! I’m out strolling a lot these days, and have gotten into a podcast habit. Do you have any recommendations for interesting RPG pods, and a few words on why? I’m interested in news, interviews, playtips advice, general good-natured chatter, RPG theory and actual plays of indie games. I’m especially interested in current shows.

I currently listen to: 

Norwegian Vertshuset and Vertshuset spiller (an AP pod): Feelgood two guys talking and a varied selection of offbeat RPGs, including Norwegian ones.

Swedish Fummelpodden: Various RPG related subjects (and Swedish Nordnordost)

Danish Lænestolsrollespil: One game as main topic per episode.

I’m aware of The Gauntlet Podcast, Fear the Boot, Happy Jack’s, +1 Forward, Dreaming of Dragons, Red Moon Roleplaying, Design Games, Critical Role.</description>

              <p>I love the Character Creation Cast. I learned a lot about different approaches to game design, character creation, and playing games from the podcast. And got introduced to many great games.<br>
Like some of the other podcasts mentioned in this thread it belongs to the Oneshot Podcast Network.</p>

<p>+1 Forward because I love PbtA as a genre generator</p>
<p>I loved the Ferrier’s Bellows because of the way they analyzed their game sessions.  That one is sadly defunct now.</p>
<p>Fear of the Black Dragon because I’m also keen on many OSR adventure modules written or reviewed with modern sensitivities in mind.</p>
<p>Oneshot Podcast has a load of hilarious actual plays of unusual systems.  Some systems and episodes are better than others but there are hundreds of episodes and probably a hundred systems to choose between.</p>
<p>Plot Points for modern reviews of ancient rpgs, and rpg history lessons.</p>
<p>I was enjoying RPG Academy’s Ghost of Saltmarsh until it either stopped it or put it behind a paywall or it mysteriously failed.</p>
<p>CrudelyDrawnSwords because it’s amusing.</p>

              <p>I listen to a bunch of AP shows and my favourites (All available wherever you get your podcasts) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Friends at the Table</em> - consistently telling strong and interesting stories using various indie games. Their seasons often have a loose interconnection between them, but the current one is an ideal jumping on point as they use Heart to tell a weird west type story in a completely new setting.</li>
<li>
<em>These Flimsy Rituals</em> have a season using their own game <em>Ryne</em> and one using <em>Blades In The Dark</em> along with some really interesting standalone episodes using other less well-known games all set in the same world. They’re a little more serious and the setting is autumnal and fading in a way that I enjoy.</li>
<li>
<em>Spout Lore</em> is a very funny Dungeon World game that really leans into the collaborative worldbuilding side of things.</li>
<li>
<em>Crudely Drawn Swords</em> is also a funny and epic Dungeon World game (with occasional wanders into other systems) and among various notable qualities I am the GM, producer, music composer and general production dogsbody, so as you might imagine it’s well aligned with what I enjoy in a show…</li>

<p>Grant Howitt and Chris Taylor spend each podcast doing two things:</p>
<p>First Half: Answering questions (from reddit r/rpg not directed at them (my fav), or from their Discord), with varying degrees of seriousness (usually approaching zero)<br>
Second Half: “Design” a game based on a prompt of something they wish existed.</p>
<p>It’s amazing to see their minds work, and also, a lot of their ideas would be good actual games.</p>

              <p>I listen to a bunch of podcasts, of very different style and content, but all I can recommend as good entertainment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.happyjacks.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Happy Jacks RPG Podcast</a> - has a weekly advice show and a multitude of APs, if that’s your thing. It’s not focused on a specific game system.</p>
<p><a href="https://blasphemoustomes.com/the-podcast/" rel="nofollow noopener">The Good Friends of Jackson Elias</a> - focused on horror gaming, horror films and first of all Call of Cthulhu. If you have no interest at all about horror, it might be a wash, but otherwise it’s a fun look at books, films and other media in the horror field and how it relates to gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://savageinterludes.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Savage Interludes</a> - while focused on Savage Worlds, this is in my mind one of the better general advice podcasts out there. The gaming specifics might be SW mechanics, but the advice on scenario design, table tools, humour and other topics are very usable regardless of game system.</p>

              <p>I know you mentioned The Gauntlet Podcast, but I’d also recommend two others from our network: +1 Forward for a combination designer interview &amp; mini-AP for a ton of different PbtA games and Fear of a Black Dragon for a deep delve into what makes a great adventure by surveying different old-school modules. Both are masterfully edited by Rich Rogers.<br>

              <p>It’s a bit of a self-plug because I do a lot of work with them, but I’d invite you to check out the <a href="https://misdirectedmark.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Misdirected Mark</a> network, which has a variety of shows, but for your list in particular, I’d recommend <em>Misdirected Mark</em> and <em>Panda’s Talking Games</em> both for play advice, design, and chatter.</p>
<p>For a lot of RPG design talk, I recommend <a href="https://stop-hack-and-roll-podcast.pinecast.co/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Stop, Hack &amp; Roll</em></a>, and actually they formed a network with <a href="https://riverhousegamespodcast.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Game Closet</em></a> which is all interviews with queer folks in the RPG space and which I also recommend. For indie RPG APs, one of the best is <a href="https://www.partyofonepodcast.com/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Party of One</em></a>, which is a series of one-shots of duet play and is a great window both into two-player games and also just indie games and designers overall. One of my more recent favorites has been the indie designer interview show <a href="https://redcircle.com/shows/draw-your-dice-podcast" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Draw Your Dice</em></a>, which highlights quite a variety of people and is really thoughtful both as an interview show and a show exploring design.</p>
<p>I listen to a ton of podcasts, so I’m just going to stop there. Plus I find listening to more podcasts is a great way to learn about even more podcasts! At least that’s how it started ballooning for me. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=9" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"> Enjoy!</p>

              <p>Hi! I’m out strolling a lot these days, and have gotten into a podcast habit. Do you have any recommendations for interesting RPG pods, and a few words on why? I’m interested in news, interviews, playtips advice, general good-natured chatter, RPG theory and actual plays of indie games. I’m especially interested in current shows.</p>
<p>I currently listen to:</p>
<p>Norwegian Vertshuset and Vertshuset spiller (an AP pod): Feelgood two guys talking and a varied selection of offbeat RPGs, including Norwegian ones.</p>
<p>Swedish Fummelpodden: Various RPG related subjects (and Swedish Nordnordost)</p>
<p>Danish Lænestolsrollespil: One game as main topic per episode.</p>
<p>I’m aware of The Gauntlet Podcast, Fear the Boot, Happy Jack’s, +1 Forward, Dreaming of Dragons, Red Moon Roleplaying, Design Games, Critical Role.</p>
