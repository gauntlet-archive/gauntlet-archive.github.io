    <title>Favorite Little Bit of Hearts of Wulin?</title>

    <description>So, playtest materials are out! I&#39;ve not had a chance to play, but I&#39;ve given them a read through and like what I see! 

In particular, I really enjoyed the tense cohesion of the PC-PC persuasion/negotiation move. It&#39;s like Pulling Strings juiced to 11! You&#39;ve got that really cool element of figuring out how much to offer the other player to tempt them into doing what you want, but it&#39;s also a move you can&#39;t walk back, because of the consequences of refusal. Invoking that move means you&#39;ve escalated things.

What&#39;s your favorite piece of tech in the game?</description>

              <p>I just love the immense story possibilities packed into the Unorthodox move Shadow Boxing:</p>
<p>SHADOW BOXING<br>
A secret group or order aids you. You may not be<br>
aware of their assistance. Once per session you<br>
can flashback to some preparation, interference,<br>
or negotiation they’ve done on your behalf.<br>
Describe it and roll. On a hit, they succeed. On a 7-<br>
9 they do so with attention or reduced effect. On a<br>
miss their interference causes you more trouble<br>
than help.</p>

              <p>Having done a lot of playtesting, I can say the PC v PC duels are indeed great.</p>
<p>My favorite bit of tech is combat with NPCs. The procedure with scale is so brilliant, and when you’re facing someone of a higher scale, you have to learn a new technique before you can have a chance of defeating them. It’s a damn elegant way of emulating the genre.</p>
