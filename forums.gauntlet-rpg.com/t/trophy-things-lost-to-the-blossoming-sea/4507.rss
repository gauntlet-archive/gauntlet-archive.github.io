    <description>*If the forest of Old Kalduhr represents mankind’s fear, then the Blossoming Sea represents its imagination. Over the centuries, all manner of treasure and people—even gods—have disappeared after setting out on its crystalline waters. In fact, a common saying among people wishing to account for something missing is “it must be lost to the Blossoming Sea.” Many treasure-hunters seek the capital necessary to fund expeditions to the Blossoming Sea, in the hopes of discovering (or recovering) these lost wonders. What sorts of things might they find on their voyage?* 

We are putting together a standalone setting book for the Trophy RPG called Trophy Loom. One of the things we’re going to do with this book is include numerous tables that help flesh out the world Trophy takes place in. Keeping with the spirit of Trophy as a community project, we’re going to be crowdsourcing many of the elements that go into these tables.

For this crowdsourcing, we’re focusing on things lost to the Blossoming Sea. In particular, we’re looking for three types of entries:

**1. Rumors about people and treasure that might be found somewhere on the Blossoming Sea.**

**2. Historical events that took place on the Blossoming Sea in which something was lost (this could be literal objects, or it could be “lost” in the sense of “losing a battle” or similar).** 

**3. Myths related to things lost to the Blossoming Sea.**

You can submit as many entries as you wish, in any or all categories, by posting a reply here. By submitting here, you agree to let us use your contribution in the Trophy Loom book and PDF (you will be credited as a contributor if we use your entry). Submissions should be fairly brief (no more than a sentence or two). Here are some examples:

“An empty sarcophagus dating from the time of Old Kalduhr is rumored to have washed ashore recently. Now, treasure-hunters and explorers the world over are wondering how many more god-kings and high priests from the ancient times may have been buried at sea.”

“Historians speak of a whaling ship, *Deep Reaver*, whose captain was so heartbroken at having lost the love of her life to plague, she and her crew undertook one final, suicidal expedition to hunt the last leviathan born during the Beginning of All Things. The ship never returned.” 

“Everyone is taught about the Whispering Isles from a young age. These islands, likely a myth, are said to be where the First Sisters were canonized—where the gods whispered to them the essential truths they would need to guide mankind.”

              <p>An ancient tale claims that on the darkest bottom of the Blossoming Sea lies a coffer containing the sea itself. If opened, it would blast off an endless amount of saltwater with tremendous pressure, as if the chest contains a portal to the bottom of the ocean. Any person unfortunate enough to find this chest, and fool enough to bring it on board, would be constantly followed by an unspeakable sea monster. The tale says the creature attacks and sinks the ship only if it comes close to any port, ensuring that the coffer containing the sea won’t ever leave its own waters.</p>

              <p>Out in the far middle of the Blossoming Sea, where the blues of the depths turn a dark black, there lays a spire. Its brine stained and coral encrusted tip pierces the water, visible between the peaks and troughs of the waves. Most would mistake it for the top of a large seamount were it not for the dark gleam that reflects off the too-smooth stone. Some call it the Inverted Lighthouse; for it not warns of danger, but is said to instead draw in ships to their doom. No one knows what happens to the ships that disappear near the spire. There is no tangle of wrecks or debris caught in the stone and coral. No survivors to speak of strange darkness, whispers, and promises of long abandoned treasure. No glimpses of what waits in the deep for those who go looking. No hint at what waits within the Lighthouse; waiting to be found.</p>

              <p>When King Ulfaad died, the people mourned greatly, for he was a wise and benevolent ruler. As were the ways back then, they built for him a funeral barge, and laid his bier atop a pyre. With thousands standing on the beach, two longships towed the barge away from shore, and archers lit the pyre with flaming arrows. The flames leapt high, yet did not consume: the barge drifted out across the Blossoming Sea, still burning, until its light disappeared over the horizon. Today, if you see a strange light on the distant water, know that you gaze upon King Ulfaad’s Funeral Barge. Take comfort, for it is an omen of wisdom and peace.</p>

Though a thick putrid decaying fog stench obscured most of the mass, what the old sailor did see was as big as an island and pockmarked with disturbingly deep rotting holes in its husk; the last desperate salvo in the final climatic sea war, and if the tales are to be believed, bristling with magicks from the purest mana artifacts from the time of Old Kalduhr.  Unnerved, her captain quickly brought the ship about to leave this forsaken area.</p>

              <p>&lt;SORRY I know you guys wanted stuff brief but I got carried away, this was just too fun!..&gt;</p>
<p>Murin ran, as fast and as far as land would allow. By horse, by cart, by foot if need be, but he could not stop his terror-fueled flight for fear of the soot-black shadows following in the footsteps of his frantic expedition. And even when the solid embrace of land fell from beneath him, Murin did not halt his quest for safety. Docked ashore the Blossoming Sea was a small vessel with no evidence of captain or crew. It was perhaps not glamorous, but glamor was not his pursuit. Taking with him merely several days supplies and a fishing pole he’d found stranded upon the ship, Murin set sail in the hopes that his shadows would not carry suit. His journey took him far upon the water - further than his scrappily rendered map depicted. Surely if he himself were lost, there would be no hope of the shadows discovering his whereabouts?</p>
<p>For a while he became content, but there came a day when his fishing pole dragged something more than a simple haddock or herring from the watery depths. As days went by the water continued to bless (and curse) Murin with gifts supposedly sought after by treasure-hunters far and wide. His bountiful treasures continued to amass with no end in sight, and his skills as a sailor grew ever more sharp - within several months time, he had become tact enough to fend off the occasional odd scavenging crew. With a horde of treasures in stock and a soul strengthened by months at sea, Murin set course for shore in the hopes of trading his bountiful horde for more useful provisions. And perhaps, he’d come upon a stroke of luck and discover that the shadows had abandoned their chase.</p>
<p>He docked his vessel and dropped to shore with a great thud, bags of gold held in both of his weathered hands. The people flocked to him, enamored by the sight of such magnificent and plentiful wealth. They clamored and gawked, begged and pleaded, reached and grappled in the hopes of swindling the strange man’s gems and gold. From the corner of his eye, however, he saw shadows flickering and shifting, drawing ever nearer through the crowd of mindless money-grabbers. With a newly returned sense of urgency and fear, Captain Murin leaped onto his ship and set out upon the Blossoming Sea once again, in the hopes that a day would come when he could safely return to his home upon land.</p>
<p>Legends say that Captain Murin’s ship still sails: perhaps he still roams the waters to this day, or perhaps his treasure alone still floats upon the vast expanse - waiting to be claimed by a soul seeking safety.</p>

At her feet are myriads of human bones. The direction she faces changes over time, perhaps due to some instability in the earth below her. For the most part it’s an innocuous mystery, as the land is so small and no culture has claimed it, or her.</p>
<p>However, seafaring towns have a story about her. You see, if you ever feel desolate and alone, and look out at the sea, you might see a path emerge over the waves leading you into her arms. It’s inviting, to be sure, but any who take this path are gone forever, lost to the blossoming sea.</p>

Instead, she accepted a betrothal from a poor fisherboy, who she had asked to bottle wind, and who had done as she had requested. Together they whittled their wedding bands from seal bone, a beautiful matched pair of sea ivory.</p>
<p>Everyone remembers her tears when he was lost at sea. Some, even, remember the way she stormed the keep, demanding to know whether the lord sabotaged her intended’s small boat. But no one was there to remember the night she threw herself into the waves, or the letter she burned before doing so. The whole town woke the next morning with the lord’s demands that they scour the waves for her.</p>
<p>Lost to the blossoming sea, was she, until the day of the lord’s funeral, when two great tuna were caught and prepared for the feast. Inside each of their mouths, under their tongue, was a small circle of carved bone.</p>

Known collectively as The Widows, or the Wracks, the statues are not identical, but share features in common: humanoid shapes; a grasping hand stretched seaward; deeply set and sad eyes; and open mouths shaped by grief that pierce the entire head of the figure, front to back.</p>
<p>Sailors in fog claim they can navigate along the coast in dense fog, steering by the mournful tones that sea breezes blow through these mouths. Those new to life at sea are teased that if they could string a rope through the heads of each of the Wracks, then run them stiff and straight to where each figure points, a treasure awaits where the ropes would meet. But that’s ridiculous. More likely these were merely navigational aids, or some warning for an earlier age.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Ships that regularly cross the Blossoming Sea have a curious practice—the calling of the daily roll of all aboard from a list kept by the ship’s master. Although life at sea is always dangerous, sailors on these waters might lose their lives—quite literally, if the tales of old salts are to be believed.</p>
<p>The origin of the superstition is unclear. References to it are found in a variety of letters, reports, and testimonies dating back to the earliest records of the Sea itself. Perhaps the most famous is the story of the <em>Merrystar</em> , a derelict schooner found adrift by a crew of whalers. The ship was empty of crew—alive or dead—but more curiously also empty of the <em>traces</em> of crew: there were no belongings in the lockers, no signs that the bunks had been disturbed, and the ships stores appeared untouched. The only thing the searchers found was a log, but this journal provoked more questions than it answered.</p>
<p>So the story goes, the log was largely mundane—or as mundane as any record of the Blossoming Sea could be. The <em>Merrystar</em> was a trader, captained by a man named Wrisp. The book contained several years of journey notes, punctuated by infrequent stories of odd or unsettling occurrences not uncommon to those waters. However, on their last journey, the narrative took a strange turn. Three days out, the captain recorded a disturbance within the crew, and made multiple references to disciplinary actions in subsequent days. A week from port, Wrisp recorded the testimony of a midshipman who seemed to be at the epicenter of the problems. The man—Krispin—had been a steady seaman on the crew for years, but seemed to have gone a little mad shortly after leaving port. Krispin insisted that another member of the crew had gone missing. He spoke quite fondly of this other man and in great detail, insisting that like he, this other sailor had crewed for Wrisp for years; however, neither Wrisp nor any other member of the crew had any recollection of the man described. Stranger still, Krispin related this other sailor had related something very similar to Krispin himself, insisting that the ship had left port with eight souls, and now had but seven.</p>
<p>The log entries that followed became more confusing still. Wrisp recorded a growing hysteria among the crew and decides to return to port. However, as he left “shorthanded,” maneuvering the vessel becomes increasingly difficult. At one point, he reread the previous log entries and was dumbfounded by what he found—though he recognized his own hand, Krispin and the names of the other crew recorded he did not. Wrisp recorded that he searched the ship and could not find any trace of any crew other than himself; even his first mate’s cabin was empty. Wrisp confessed that he had not seen the woman in a day, but whether she was lost to this “strange forgetting that you have forgotten” or some other thing, he could not say. In the final entry, dated the day before, Wrisp reported that he has seen a ship on the horizon that he intended to signal, but was compelled to record first a strange dream that he has had. He began to relate this story that he had returned to his home port but that no one knew him, not even his wife. Alone and forgotten, he made his way to the docks, where a man he recognized as Krispin greeted him, and told him that the ship is ready to make sail. He asked Krispin where they will sail to, but Krispin’s reply is not recorded. As the story goes, the log ended in mid-stroke.</p>
<p>Some tellings of the <em>Merrystar</em> ’s tale end there, but a few say that there was more, that the captain of the whaler was an unimaginative and practical man, not given to superstitious nonsense, and that he dispatched what crew he could spare to the other ship and together they sailed back to port. The whaler captain recognized the shipwright’s work in the lines of the <em>Merrystar</em> and, hoping to but a claim of salvage to the owner, visited the crafter. However, the shipwright had no recollection of ever constructing the ship nor any captain named Wrisp, even when—after some persuasion—he was able to find these names in his ledgers. Prompted by the scant details in Wrisp’s log, the whaler captain revisited the other man’s life, but no one remembered any such man, his crew, or his ship. The whaler captain finally visited the woman Wrisp had named as his wife, who insisted that she was unwed and had never known anyone of that name. Sensing something more, the whaler pressed, and under his insistence, she finally did allow that though what she had said was true, she had—only a few nights before—had a strange dream in which a man had confronted her claiming to be her husband and that though she could not remember the name he had given, it might have been that….</p>
<p>So, every day at dawn, sailors on the Blossoming Sea gather for the calling of names. And should a name be called that is unknown to others, a wise captain will set course for the closest port.</p>

              <p>At the height of the Last Empire, its decadence and glory a fever of waste, the mad Golden Heresiarch ruled the capital, now sunk beneath the sea. He called for tribute from all polities, and all gave tribute to him, so great was the power he had usurped.  Bloated with stolen riches and plunder from the commonweal the Heresiarch demanded more and his soothsayers, witches and heirophants complied in pain and extremity.  Other spheres were sent declarations of power and demands of tribute.  Most laughed, the celestial thrones quaking with mirth that his advisors hid from the Heresiarch, but born of insatiable curiosity and decorum the Brass Ones of the Inverse Brass Pyramid sent a treasure ship across the void in response.</p>
<p>When the ship lighted in the harbor of the Capitol, a vast chariot of brass and silver, held aloft by a piece of the sun the harbor burned.  The Empire laughed and rejoiced, the Heresiarch squealed with contentment at his power.  The Brass Ones looked out from their vessel and saw only depravity.  Their metal faces wept with the unreason and folly of the dying Empire, squandering the stored labor of ages, the wealth of slaughtered peoples and fruits of the tired earth to please the ego of one mad man.  Their tears carved paths across masks of horror and their minds broke under what they witnessed.  The child sun the rode snuffed out in bleak incomprehension.</p>
<p>The treasure ship sank, boiling into the harbor and with it items of power beyond human ken.  It sink beneath the waves, beneath the silt, beneath the rock - carving a path with the grave of a dead star.  With it sank the Capital, the Heresiarch and the Empire. Famine, flood and fire rippled outward from the site of the Heresiarch’s crime, and left only scavengers, and eaters of men to wonder from the poisoned shore at the placid spread of the Blossoming Sea where once spired the towers of wealth and distinction.</p>
<p>On calm nights, sailors claim that in the dead stretches of the Sea a keen listener can still hear the bells of the Last Empire’s temples tolling in the currents below.</p>

<p>He lost his ship to brine and foam<br>
Not quite living, haunted alone.</p>
<p>He has a map of old regard<br>
To find the text of Saint Ulnaur.<br>
The pigment moves beneath his eyes<br>
A glimmer of gold, a shimmer of lies.</p>
<p>Come with him now to sea’s embrace.<br>
For fate demands truth of faith.</p>

              <p>It is widely rumored in the small villages that litter the edges of the Blossoming Sea, that deep below, the last creation of a mad sea god lies. Rumored to be a lure, for any and all creatures, it rests at the bottom, it’s mad whispers of all your heart’s desires. The soothing images and empty promises dragging more and more adventurers down to the depths, ever casting for a prey no one knows.</p>
