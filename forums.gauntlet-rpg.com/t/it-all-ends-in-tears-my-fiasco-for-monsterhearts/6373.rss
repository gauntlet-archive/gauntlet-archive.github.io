    <title>It All Ends in Tears - My Fiasco for Monsterhearts</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/it-all-ends-in-tears-my-fiasco-for-monsterhearts/6373</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had a great deal of fun - and great deal of success - running Monsterhearts campaigns for non-gamers now, over the last decade or so.

However, for a long time I struggled with the genre. Worse yet, I didn&#39;t want to leave players floundering. So I made myself a tool, and it&#39;s become my secret weapon for playing the game. It&#39;s been tremendously engaging and satisfying, and I&#39;ve used to jump-start three full-fledged M&lt;3s campaigns by now.

It&#39;s a Fiasco-style playset I wrote specifically for Monsterhearts, with slightly modified procedures. 

Simply throwing it down onto the table gets people&#39;s attention, and they usually want to play immediately! (&quot;What&#39;s that?!? I want to play!&quot;)

Some of the playset doubles as a random generator during play, as well (for instance, to create a new classmate, I&#39;ll often just roll up a Reputation for them).

I&#39;ll share it here, in case someone else can get the same joy out of it that I have!

<p>I had a lot of fun writing it, and it’s been great in play as well. If anyone else uses it, I’d love to hear how that goes!</p>
