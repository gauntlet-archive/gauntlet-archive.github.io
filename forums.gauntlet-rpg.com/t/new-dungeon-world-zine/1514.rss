    <description>New to the new forums, hope it is kosher to post about your own products here...if not, delete away.

I just finished my first new &#39;zine in decades and since it was inspired by the Gauntlet community and Codex, I wanted to let the community know about it. Feel free to ask questions here and I will be happy to respond. 

![MOTiVE1_cover%20copy|259x400](upload://oNU71Bj3Jh49EaOrFrMG2IFhY8K.jpeg) 

The zine is called **MOTiVE**, and this first issue begins a four-part journey into a twisted faerie world. ***The Green-Golden Rade*** is a fey realm in the form of a road (or rade, horse- path) that can connect any locations. Terrible fey nobles placed the hearts of unrequited lovers in amber stelae as its milestones when it was fashioned by the labors of their enchanted slaves. These beautiful and capricious lords then called the Green-Golden Rade forth to travel into the arms of their lovers, or arrive behind the defenses of their most hated foes. In the beginning the nobles paid the road’s toll with the shame of their servants, the tears of mothers who lost children, or the sanity of mortals tempted onto the road. Now all who pace its ancient cobbles pay their own way. Today the Green-Golden Rade reaches out to the world, yearning for heart-sick, passionate, or desperate travelers.

You can find the first issue at [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/270923/MOTIVE-Issue-1-The-GreenGolden-Rade).

              <p>Issue three of my *Dungeon World '*zine, <strong>MOTiVE: Redthorn</strong> is up as PWYW on DriveThru RPG. Due to some (non-Covid) health challenges this year, I was not positive that this would be finished. I hope you enjoy this issue! Even if you are not following the Redthorn setting, this issue has an adventure, 11 monsters and 3 detailed maps. Happy holidays!<br>

<p><em>Imagine a reality where mastering alchemy, steam science, and uncanny magic is within reach. It means the difference between survival and death. The cost? Slow withering of your body and soul — every tendril of mystic power connects to the strange Others. Without their goodwill, your fate may be left to one of the four great Curses, which have no sympathy. With the Others’ aid, you can find riches, fame, and glory…for a time.<br>
Welcome to the world of Redthorn. It is a realm where unknown cataclysms destroyed the comfortable life of humans, reducing them from an apex species to ordinary prey. Various cultures work together to create a semblance of normal life in towns and villages. Water, both as a power source and transport, dominates the landscape. This is the foreground where players will weave their own story amidst decay, oddity, and for the courageous, perhaps even hope.</em></p>

<p>DRAFT of the Introduction to Motive <span class="hashtag">#3:</span></p>
<p><strong>Motivations</strong></p>
<p>Greetings and thanks for joining me for the penultimate issue of Motive Volume I. With the next issue I will have completed my treatment of The Green-Golden Rade. Next year, a new volume, and a new topic. More on that in December.</p>
<p>If you have happened upon this issue without perusing the first two, be warned that most of the mechanics surrounding travel along the Green-Golden Rade will be found in those earlier issues. Even lacking those, I think you will find inspiration here for your game.</p>
<p>Like the previous issues, this one contains even more encounter ideas, including seeds for your imagination and some events that can be used straight from the book.</p>
<p>This issue is a bit lighter in tone than the last and concentrates on the denizens of the Green-Golden rade, introducing fairy creatures from several mythologies: Ammut, Bogey, Kappa, Ōmukade, Phouka, Redcap, Spriggan, Stock, Thunderbird. There is also a section just on Fomorians, including 24 deformities.</p>
<p>See you in December for issue number four — our final issue detailing The Green-Golden Rade.</p>

<p>From the introduction to <span class="hashtag">#2:</span></p>
<p><strong>Motivations</strong></p>
<p>Greetings and thanks for journeying along the Green-Golden Rade with me again! This quarter’s issue has a lot to expand the usefulness of the Green-Golden Rade in your game.</p>
<p>We start with some GM advice, new options and some helpful lists of magic items. I’ve included the Wild Hunt that I hinted at in the vanguard move writeup last issue. It is a hard move, though you may find other opportunities to use it.</p>
<p>Next are some event seeds and five detailed events to engage the players — hopefully a nice mix of action and pathos. To add another way to entwine the characters’ lives into the Green-Golden Rade, there is a new compendium class, the Enchanted.</p>
<p>The largest section covers dead ends - the pocket dimensions that often act as traps for unlucky travelers. One of these, The Inn of Seven Tales ranges into eastern mythologies for faerie inspiration.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from you if you have any feedback. Especially if you have used elements of the Green-Golden Rade in your games! If you find some holes you want paved over during the last two issues of the Green-Golden Rade, you’d better let me know soon. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>See you in September for issue number three.</p>

              <p>Hey folks, sorry I disappeared from the forums. I had a bout of imposter syndrome, trying to launch a podcast, zine and other social media endeavors at the same time.  Easy for some, but not for me. Thanks for your replies earlier, I hope my disappearance does not put you off my 'zine.</p>
<p>The one thing I did not do, was stop writing. The second issue went up in June and the third will be out by the end of the month.</p>

              <p>The first issue covers the narrative themes and mechanics of traveling the rade. Essentially, the price for getting off of the rade is blood and passion/regret. When you experience these you are rewarded with Toll - pun/ double entendre intended. You pay the Toll to leave, but the rade has ways of sucking you back in. A GM might use the GGR as an interlude, a recurring thread. A character could also use it as a cool backstory element.</p>
<p>Issue 1 has moves around these procedures, example encounters, a magic item, etc.</p>
<p>Next issue has an encounter and a magic item inspired by my  title in the Patreon/Gauntlet Community, btw.</p>

              <p>New to the new forums, hope it is kosher to post about your own products here…if not, delete away.</p>
<p>I just finished my first new 'zine in decades and since it was inspired by the Gauntlet community and Codex, I wanted to let the community know about it. Feel free to ask questions here and I will be happy to respond.</p>
<p><img src="//gauntlet-forums-storage.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/add857978e773b60c08d0d67b2f03f1f38e6d016.jpeg" alt="MOTiVE1_cover%20copy" data-base62-sha1="oNU71Bj3Jh49EaOrFrMG2IFhY8K" width="259" height="400"></p>
<p>The zine is called <strong>MOTiVE</strong>, and this first issue begins a four-part journey into a twisted faerie world. <em><strong>The Green-Golden Rade</strong></em> is a fey realm in the form of a road (or rade, horse- path) that can connect any locations. Terrible fey nobles placed the hearts of unrequited lovers in amber stelae as its milestones when it was fashioned by the labors of their enchanted slaves. These beautiful and capricious lords then called the Green-Golden Rade forth to travel into the arms of their lovers, or arrive behind the defenses of their most hated foes. In the beginning the nobles paid the road’s toll with the shame of their servants, the tears of mothers who lost children, or the sanity of mortals tempted onto the road. Now all who pace its ancient cobbles pay their own way. Today the Green-Golden Rade reaches out to the world, yearning for heart-sick, passionate, or desperate travelers.</p>
<p>You can find the first issue at <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/270923/MOTIVE-Issue-1-The-GreenGolden-Rade" rel="nofollow noopener">DriveThruRPG</a>.</p>
