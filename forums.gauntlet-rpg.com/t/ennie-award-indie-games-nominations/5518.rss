    <description>Saw this article on Polygon today about the Ennie Award nominations for indie games. I only heard of a couple of these, but all of them sound amazing! I particularly like the emphasis on story games for most of them. Has anyone experience with any of them?

I know it has been run a couple of times on The Gauntlet, and I’d be happy to answer any questions about it - or you could find out a little more on my site here (which includes links to documentaries and dramas about some of the remarkable women it honours)</p>

              <p>My only quibble with <em>Zombie World</em> is that its box is exactly the wrong size. It’s way too big for the basic set that comes in it, but not big enough/the wrong dimensions to fit the expansions.</p>

              <p>Of the Indie nominations, I’ve looked at Mork Borg - which is a real triumph of aesthetic design and seems like a perfectly good rules light classic style fantasy adventure with intentional design that supports and is supported by its heavy metal, slightly psychedelic, implied setting.</p>
<p>I read some stuff on Thousand Year Old Vampire, but haven’t played it - it seems quite cool.</p>
<p>I should add that there’s a lot of other stuff there that’s quite good - Bastionland, UVG, Mothership, Rakehell, the good stuff I missed – all amazing products that even if it’s not “indie” in the sense of “storygame” is absolutely great and worthwhile.</p>

              <p>I have played Zombie World. Like all of Magpie’s output, it’s very smartly designed. The form factor of cards rather than dice makes it seem likely to reach a broader audience than already invested RPG fans.</p>
<p>I’ll add that I’m extremely honored to see my game <a href="https://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/secret-science-sewer-siblings" rel="nofollow noopener">Secret Science Sewer Siblings</a> get an ENnie nomination for Best Free Game!</p>
