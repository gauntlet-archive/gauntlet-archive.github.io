    <description>Artemisia Academy is a famous boarding school school in rural Vermont, founded over a century ago by Aldric Ellynham. Some called him a &quot;business tycoon,&quot; others a &quot;robber baron&quot;. A few even whispered he was an occultist. Aldric wanted to give the best possible education to the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists of every generation. Soon, however, the academy also began admitting rich scions with no talent other than driving their families to hide them away at the isolated school. The resulting student body is equal parts brilliant, wealthy, and unwanted.



A normal high school can feel like your whole world. Now imagine attending a boarding school separated from the nearest town by twenty miles of winding mountain roads. For months at a time, you see no one except your fellow students and the few staff members who can stand the place.



In addition to shaping its admissions criteria, Aldric Ellynham had the physical academy built to his exacting and bizarre standards. The pathways twist in strange patterns. Every room of every building seems just a little out of sync with the rest. Every inch of the place is subtly disturbing. The atmosphere is not improved by the school&#39;s unusually high rate of disappearances and persistent rumors of even worse. The only staff who stay are those who have no other options or, worse, the ones who&#39;ve grown strangely attached to the academy.



You are a student at Artemisia. This is your only chance at a great education... and maybe your last chance before vanishing altogether.



Come be a teenage monster in the pressure cooker of an understaffed boarding school with dark secrets. Come explore Artemisia Academy with Monsterhearts 2 by Avery Alder.



We will be utilizing safety tools such as the X-Card, script change tools, and lines and veils. You must RSVP for every session you wish to attend but need not attend every session. I do encourage attending as many sessions as you can. 

The sessions may be recorded and posted if all are okay with this. [The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
