    <description>I am deciding whether &quot;The sprawl&quot; or &quot;The veil&quot; is targeted at me. From what I read, &quot;The spawl&quot; is more on the Shadowrun side of things, mission-centric. Where as &quot;The veil&quot; as I understand it, is more about the philosophical aspects of living the cyberpunk future - I&#39;ve read someone mentioning  &quot;Ghost in the shell&quot; as a comparison. 

So both emulate the genre in their own way.

Unfortunately, I am into both sides of the story. And my question comes down to:
Would it be possible to play out &quot;mission style&quot; or &quot;action packed&quot; games with &quot;The Veil&quot;. I mean in a sense of, that it is not completely off the rails to do the one or other &quot;mission&quot;.

Of course the general answer is that it depends on what you make out of the rules. OTOH I think it is maybe easier to do missions in the &quot;veil&quot; than to play the things between missions as your main part in &quot;The sprawl&quot;. From my impression of the game this would be something &quot;The sprawl&quot; isn&#39;t good at.

I hope my question makes sense ☺️</description>

              <p>I’ve never tried it, but I bet you could use the mission structure from <em>The Sprawl</em> with the moves and playbooks from <em>The Veil</em>. It might require some thinking on your feet for move/clock interactions, but it should be doable.</p>

I read some further articles and listened to the +1 forward episode on “The Veil” and came to the conclusion, that it suits the style I want to play better. Although the sprawl seems tailored to emulate  shadowrun, a style which I do like, from what I’ve read, it only seems to that one thing well.</p>

              <p>Caveat: I have not read or played <em>The Sprawl</em>.</p>
<p>From what I know and have heard from people who have played <em>The Sprawl</em> it is really great at giving the mission/betrayal feel of first wave Cyberpunk. That is what it is tightly designed to do. And AFAIK it really enforces that structure of missions mechanically.</p>
<p><em>The Veil</em> (and <em>Cascade</em> and the forthcoming <em>Inheritance</em>) are designed to cover a broader spectrum of the questions raised by Cyberpunk (over its various waves). You could do mission stuff in it - the system won’t fight you but it won’t give you a ton of mechanical support though. (Outside of some dealing harm type moves.) But if you can support the style yourself in the fiction you’d be fine.</p>
<p>In the <em>Veil</em> campaign I was in we had a little bit of mission/action stuff but it certainly wasn’t what we the players were really focused on. But those parts mostly worked and I think they would rock with players who wanted to do that stuff.</p>
<p>I certainly think <a class="mention" href="/u/frasersimons">@frasersimons</a> would have some thoughts on the subject though…</p>

              <p>Oh yeah! <em>The Veil</em>’s playbooks bring in the questions about the human condition—but the basic moves definitely allow you some adrenaline pumping moment-to-moment action scenes. In fact, I would say, they focus on that.</p>
