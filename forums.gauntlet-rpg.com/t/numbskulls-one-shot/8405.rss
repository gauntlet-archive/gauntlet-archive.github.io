    <description>**Game 1 of my Spooktober Saturdays Series: Numbskulls by Kaden Ramstack**

**For the first 48 hours please only RSVP if you are not already registered in another one of the Spooktober Saturday games.**

You and your Skeleton Crew are the minions of the great and powerful Necromancer! Your duty is to fulfill their wishes to the best of your ability, the only problem is Necromancy is forbidden, so you must pretend to be human while out in public spaces. 

**System**: Numbskulls. Rules will be taught and reference items provided. 

**Vibe**: Slapstick spooky

**Possible content warnings**: Skeletons, corpses, necromancy. Safety tools will be in play.

**Breaks**: On the hour or as required

**Session Length**: 3 hours

**Venue**: Discord

**Recording**: Only with everyone&#39;s agreement and permission

**Safety Tools**: Lines and Veils, X-Card, Open Table, and other/additional tools to suit the players
