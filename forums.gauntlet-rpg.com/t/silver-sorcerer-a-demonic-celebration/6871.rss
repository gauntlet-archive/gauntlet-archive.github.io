With little fanfare or notice, *Sorcerer: An Intense Roleplaying Game* has turned 25! This groundbreaking game by Ron Edwards was a watershed in design, play experience, and publication. It pioneered such ideas as lines and veils, kickers, and bangs, and it also revolutionized the thinking about how independent games could be produced and distributed outside of traditional commercial currents.

The elevator pitch: Your character has made a Faustian bargain with a demon, and you are now trying to decide how much you are willing to risk to get what you want. The game relies heavily on player input to determine the nature of demons and the world, ensuring that every experience of the game is unpredictable, surprising and unique. 

All rules will be taught, so no previous experience with the game is necessary. Whether this is the first you have heard of *Sorcerer* or you played it back in the mists of time, you are welcome at the table.

Each session will be three hours, with much of our first session devoted to creating characters, relationships, demons, and the setting. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged, but not required.  You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. Sessions will be recorded with everyone’s permission.

We will have a pregame discussion of lines and veils as well as employ the X-card during sessions. We will observe the Gauntlet Code of Conduct.

Content Warnings: The players will determine the precise course of the experience, so we won’t know exactly what we are getting into until we meet. Many games of *Sorcerer* veer into modern horror territory, with mature themes and violence in the mix. Demons by nature tend to be iconoclasts, and they enjoy thumbing their noses at traditional moral standards. So don’t get into this expecting them to be warm and fuzzy or to play nice. But do expect some fun and memorable times. We will be aiming for a PG-13 to R rating.

<p>Zip manages to get the demon Kontrakt to rebel against his former master, and Zip immediately binds Kontrakt to himself. But his associates Jackson and Taylor are concerned that Zip has been possessed, and they conduct a ritual to banish Kontrakt back to the abyss. This final session of our run of Sorcerer is filled with hijinks and deliciously wry humor.<br>

<strong>Session 0</strong></p>
<p>We are playing a game of Sorcerer set in South Beach, where the Demons are fashionably neon, and the Sorcerers are finding themselves surrounded by some odd real estate deals and internet trolls which seem to have occult influences operating behind them. We have a young hustler with a living tattoo, a real estate agent literally possessed by a spirit of prosperity, and a twitter taste-maker who keeps his demon safely secured in his smart phone. South Beach seems like its all fun and games, but will those demons stay in line?<br>
