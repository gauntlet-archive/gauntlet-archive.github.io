    <description>It&#39;s Wintertime in the Wasteland. The Warlords are gearing up for the holidays, and there&#39;s a lot of work for those who know where to look. Try to keep warm, it&#39;s rough out there.

**We&#39;re playing Apocalypse World: Burned Over.**

Thematically the game focuses on: Being hot. Surviving a horrific world. Keeping it together as best as possible. What to do when there isn&#39;t enough of anything to go around.

And there’s something really wrong with the world, and I don’t know what it is. The world wasn’t always like this, blasted and brutal. There wasn’t always a psychic maelstrom howling just out of your perception, waiting for you to open your brain so that it can rush in. Who fucked the world up, and how? Is there a way back? A way forward? If anybody’s going to ever find out, it’s you and your characters.

I will send a reminder 1 week before the session. Rules will be taught.

**CW:**  Apocalypse (it&#39;s in the title), winter, Winter Holidays (yep, those ones), economic oppression, cheating, lying, betrayal, and struggle for day to day survival. Oh, and a high likelihood of weapons, violence, and other mayhem.

**Tone:**  It&#39;s the apocalypse and life is really hard, but we can wink at it a bit and laugh to cover the pain.

**System**  : Apocalypse World, Burned Over

**Duration**  : 3 Hours

**Breaks**  : 5-10 minutes approximately on the hour

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : No

**Safety**  : Session Zero, Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).</description>
