Captain Nightshade’s intention to steal two mystically engraved organ pipes from St Sucre’s Grand Opera House is complicated first by a fire, and then by the rest of his crew.  Clay Golem Raku is always eager to get things right and follows instructions (very) literally before losing its cool and swatting away a platoon of Marines.  Clance, the only crew member possessed by a Demon (as far as we know), can’t resist ‘all the shiny things’ and finds himself between a fire and an angry crowd of St Sucre’s great and good, before cutting the rope securing a candelabra and shooting to the roof.  Jamie, the ship’s Chronicler prefers a quiet read and keeps her angry djinn in its bad tempered place, but seeing everyone’s aura is a strain that she can’t contain when confronted by a previous employer.  Through it all Captain Nightshade keeps his coool (and his organ pipes) so they can help him chart a route through the Deathwaters next time in … Rapscallions.</p>
