## **PLEASE WAIT UNTIL ALL ACCESS TIME TO REGISTER IF YOU PLAYED YOUR FIRST GAUNTLET GAME BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1, 2020.**  I&#39;m creating priority space for new members in this run. 

Prom is tomorrow, today&#39;s a math test and an alien invasion, and your powers have only just returned after the Battle of Band Trip. Good thing your lab partner is an extraterrestrial princess and your best friend is a secret vigilante.

Super Destiny High School Rumble!! is an anime-inspired tabletop RPG that uses the Apocalypse World Engine for fast character creation and rules-light, collaborative storytelling.

## Note: This game series will allow players aged 13 and up.
