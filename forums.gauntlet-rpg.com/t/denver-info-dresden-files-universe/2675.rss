              <p>We used the MOTW history questions, each character having a link/question linking them to two other characters.</p>
<p>One of the games was right at the start of the red court vs white council war, so no one was allied with the red court vampires.</p>
<p>But we had a crooked-burglar, divine-joan of arc, white council wizard, white court succubus, even a Flake (conspiracy nut) <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>After history questions I would offer a ‘this is how you all met suggestion, like You all met at college’’ but was open to them thinking of an event based on history/own ideas.</p>
<p>The teams often split into twos, and thats cool it allowed more spotlight roleplaying times.</p>
