    <title>Wanderhome (Thursdays in June, 9pm US Eastern)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/wanderhome-thursdays-in-june-9pm-us-eastern/6822</link>
    <description>This is for a four-session run of the cozy pastoral fantasy game *, Wanderhome* , scheduled for 9:00pm US Eastern time on Thursdays in June. Prior experience with the game is not expected (rules will be taught during and throughout play). I will send out a group email about a week before the first session to confirm everyone’s intent to play and to provide set-up and invitation details. We will be playing without a &quot;guide,&quot; meaning the game will be GM-less and we will all work together to create the stories and situations that our characters play through, as is the case with other Belonging Outside Belonging/No Dice, No Masters-style games. We will be playing as traveling fantasy animals (in the style of Redwall) who grow, learn from one another, and heal as they share their travels with other characters, visit new and wondrous locations, and experience all the seasons of the world around them.

*Set forth into a world of grassy fields, mossy shrines, herds of bumblebees, rabbits in sundresses, geckos with suspenders, starry night skies, and the most beautiful sunsets you can imagine. We will befriend stag beetles the size of houses, argue with the King of the Floating Mountain, fall in love in the basket of a hot air balloon up in the clouds, and go on a journey with some of the most amazing people you could ask for. Where will we go? What will we see? We’ll have to find out together. Will you join me?*

My hope is that this game will feel warm, heartfelt, &quot;feel-good,&quot; and--dare I say, therapeutic.
