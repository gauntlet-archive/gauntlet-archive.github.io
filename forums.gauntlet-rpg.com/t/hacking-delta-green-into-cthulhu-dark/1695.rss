    <description>Anyone familiar with Delta Green (DG) and Cthulhu Dark (CD) will immediately see the tension of cobbling them together: DG is a very intricate, skill based system about competent federal agents while CD is a bare bones ruleset about protagonist from the fringes of society. DG is about the procedural work of professionals to uncover the unwelcome truth, CD is more like a tunnel of horror that moves you past the misery to the bitter end.
Although both groups of protagonists will eventually come to the realization of the cosmic horror that lies beneath reality, I see at least two areas that need to be addressed: Insight and Exposure.
**Insight**: In CD PCs can reduce Insight once it reaches 5 by suppressing Mythos knowledge. That doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense in the context of DG because that is what they are supposed to do anyways. In DG they try to keep their sanity by chain-smoking, alcoholism and using antidepressants or illegal drugs. Also sanity loss is affecting the relationship to their loved once; they have bonds that they can use to regain sanity points between missions (meh) or they can project sanity loss onto their bonds, straining the relationship in the process until it breaks. How should the agents reduce Insight? Do they get a number of bonds, or 1 bond and a “strained” condition for the bond? How do you mechanically account for drug abuse? Escalating in 4 steps from recreational drugs to opium or just narratively?
**Exposure** (a [suggestion](http://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/hacking-cthulhu-dark/) by the author) is another die like Insight that starts at 1 and goes up whenever the agents do something reckless that could draw attention to the mission. I assume that there is just one die per cell (instead of per PC) but I’m unsure if it should just be a pacing mechanism / tension meter like Impending Doom in Dungeon World or whether the PCs should be able to reduce it when it reaches 5 by doing something morally dubious like killing witnesses.</description>

              <p>If this is using standard BitD rules for the most part, a couple simple ways to turn up the Stress might be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the alternative resistance mechanic that doesn’t require subtraction: IE you roll the resistance dice and take the lowest die value in Stress. On average players earn one additional Stress per Resist this way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ramp up the opportunities to force players to resist without having to have them do an action roll. Maybe to act rationally in a scary situation they have to resist fear or what have you.</p>

First session is all about espionage in occupied  Prague, but we get our first firefight in session 2 when the characters ‘Confront the Mythos and its minions’.<br>
I will admit that I’m happy with how the hack is playing and particularly pleased with feedback from the players that the firefight felt ‘real’ even though it relied on very few rolls of the dice pool.  I will admit to hoping that we’ll see at least one of them driven to ‘Seek relief from the horror’ next week!</p>

              <p>I really like that the scenario is not a bug hunt but messes with the players psychologically (cannibalism is a nice icky subject). What I realized while prepping published Delta Green scenarios for CD is that it really helps to follow Graham Walmsley’s procedures which are: Identifying the themes, manifestations of the creeping horror and the final revelation. I’m not sure if you can always find a compromise between investigation a case and creating personal horror but I think for the example mission it could be immensely helpful to provide a template by making these categories explicit.<br>
So for “Food for the Gods” the theme could be hunger or fear of losing control, the creeping horror could be people eating ravenously and noisily, a homeless person looking for food in a garbage can while obese people pass by, the smell of food likened to body odor or a stray dog that ate its own paw and the final horror might be the realization that eating human flesh is really delicious or that hundreds of cans of Ambrosia have been shipped all over the world.<br>
Another way of making the horror more personal is following the suggestion by Jason Morningstar in his Delta Green scenario “Sukakpak” where the Handler asks the players questions about their characters’ background in relation to the horror. So for “Food for the Gods” you could add questions like: What smell makes your mouth water, what is the most disgusting / delicious thing you’ve ever eaten, when was the last time you were so hungry you felt like starving or so full that you couldn’t move and then using the answers in the appropriate moment for maximum effect.<br>
Again, I’m not sure you always have to do it that way but I was definitely struggling to combine the police procedural / spy movie tropes of DG with the personal horror of CD.</p>

              <p>Wow, this is pretty amazing and I don’t think there is anything important missing. Maybe you could add drugs as a way to either temporarily reduce stress or harm or suppress Mythos Knowledge by 1 - but with the obvious drawback of developing an addiction. That seems to be in line with CD where reducing Insight always comes with a cost. Likewise, maybe the At Home scenes could be resolved with a roll and the GM or other players could roll a Failure Die if they think not repairing an anchor or treating a disorder would be interesting.<br>
The Green Box details are great: Reading your comment about storytelling collaboration got me thinking if you could even run an improv game just based on whatever you roll up on the Green Box list, maybe an additional list of story prompts and some leading questions.<br>
On page 12 the layout is a bit wonky but that could be on my end (it’s not obvious which parts belong to Repping the Organization and Collaborating with your team).</p>
