    <description>QUIETUS is a one shot, prepless RPG of melancholic horror. It&#39;s a game for a GM and one or two players, and emulates tragic horror films like  *Oculus* ,  *The Strangers* ,  *The Babadook* ,  *Inside*  and the recent Netflix version of  *The Haunting of Hill House* . Other touchstones that come to mind when I think of Quietus include Martyrs (2008), Antichrist (2009), The Blackcoat&#39;s Daughter (2015), Hereditary (2018), The Lodge (2019), and other character-focused horror films that are every bit as bleak and depressing as they are frightening.

Powered by a stripped down version of the award-winning Blades in the Dark engine, you&#39;ll create characters with tragic backstories, and send them hurtling headlong into a nightmare where their trauma might be the only thing that saves them.

This will be a two player game, but one place has been held for a Gauntlet member who requested the game.

**CW: This is a game with potentially intense violent, disturbing and emotional content. It is somewhat unique among horror games in that it attempts to evoke feelings of sadness every bit as much as fear. Themes of trauma, loss, grief, regret, etc., may therefore be present. Because the game is prepless, players work with the GM to create the set-up for the scenario, allowing players ample opportunity to rule out any content they would prefer not to see in the game.**

**System :** Quietus by Oli Jeffery

**Duration :** One 3-hour session

**Breaks :** Short breaks at the top of each hour-ish (~5 minutes)

**Venue :** Zoom

**Recording :** Optional, with permission from all participants before and after the session

**Attendance :** One-shot

**Safety :** Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, Open Door Policy. Tools can be modified throughout the game to suit player needs.

This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
