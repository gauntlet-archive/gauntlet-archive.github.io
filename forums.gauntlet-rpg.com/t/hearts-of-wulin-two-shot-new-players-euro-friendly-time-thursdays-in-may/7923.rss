    <description>**HEARTS OF WULIN: WEDDING OF THUNDER AND SILENCE**
***For the first 48 hours please only sign up if you either a) joined the Gauntlet from July &#39;21 onwards or b) haven&#39;t played in a regular Calendar series with me as GM.***
 
This marriage will cement an alliance between two factions of the wuxia world, but not everyone wants that. Hearts will be broken, loves confessed, and villains confronted. Does your heart yearn for the bride? for the groom? Or is the object of your affection drawn to them? And what about the rumors of Immortal Bat and their plans to disrupt the ceremony?

This is for a two-shot of *Hearts of Wulin* taking place at a grand wuxia event. Hearts of Wulin is a PbtA of wuxia melodrama in the vein of *The Untamed* and *Handsome Siblings*, but no familiarity is required. Rules will be taught. In session one, discuss tone &amp; safety, create characters, establish entanglements and get to playing. An array of NPCs will be provided as lovers, rivals, friends, and foes.

Rules will be taught. Attendance at both sessions is strongly encouraged; please sign up for both.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
