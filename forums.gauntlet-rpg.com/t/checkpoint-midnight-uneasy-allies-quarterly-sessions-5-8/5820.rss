    <title>Checkpoint Midnight: Uneasy Allies Quarterly (Sessions 5-8)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/checkpoint-midnight-uneasy-allies-quarterly-sessions-5-8/5820</link>
    <description>***Please note: This is the second series in a quarterly long-term playtest that will run for 12 sessions. Please wait 72 hours to sign up if you did not sign up for Sessions 1-4.***

1950 in Vienna. It&#39;s the dawn of the Cold War. The wounds of the Second World War are still fresh, and the city is divided. Control is shared by the victorious Allies, but the influence of the Nazis still lingers in the back alleys and the corridors of power.

In  *Checkpoint Midnight* , the players will take on the role of espionage agents engaged in the Great Game between the occupying powers: France, England, the USSR, and the USA.  *But they&#39;re not just any agents* . They&#39;ve all been touched by the strange, the uncanny, the  *supernatural* . They&#39;ll use their fantastic and terrifying abilities to navigate the treacherous political forces of their new home, and perhaps even prosper there.

This is a Gauntlet Quarterly offering! It&#39;s a mini-campaign that will run a dozen sessions, allowing us to test the advancement rules and develop a satisfying story arc for our characters! There will be 4 character total, 1 slot is reserved for the game&#39;s designer, @Alexi_Sarge.

Content warning: violence, betrayal, discussion of war including possibly war crimes. Roleplaying depicting criminal espionage activity including murder. We&#39;ll use Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, and Open Door to make sure everyone can participate as safely as possible. This event adheres to the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
