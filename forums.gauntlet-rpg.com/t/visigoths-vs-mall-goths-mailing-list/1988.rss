    <description>The Visigoths vs. Mall Goths Kickstarter isn&#39;t until October, but it would bring much joy to my future self if you would all do me the honor of signing up for the mailing list, so that I spend less of the Autumn tracking down the email addresses of everyone I&#39;ve played RPGs with in my entire life. This isn&#39;t going to be like those daily emails asking why you haven&#39;t logged into Scruff (cough), I&#39;m just going to send out an email with the Kickstarter link when it&#39;s live.
