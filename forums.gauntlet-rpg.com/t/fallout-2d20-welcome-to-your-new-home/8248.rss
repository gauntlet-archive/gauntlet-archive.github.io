    <title>Fallout 2d20: Welcome to Your New Home</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/fallout-2d20-welcome-to-your-new-home/8248</link>
    <description>This is for four sessions of Fallout 2d20, a post-apocalyptic rpg based on the video game property. We will be trying out the system. To make things easier, I will be putting together a set of pre-gens for the major archetypes which you’ll be able to tweak. You will all be from an existing settlement which is facing turmoil (if you&#39;re a Vault Dweller, you arrived recently). In session one we’ll assign characters, talk safety, establish relationships, and get to playing.

We will be playing rules as written generally, to get a feel for the game. We will be leaving out some of the more complicated sub-systems: crafting, weapon modification, chems &amp; addiction. Otherwise we’ll be playing things as is. If you’re familiar with other 2d20 games this should be easy to pick up, but we will be teaching the rules. Having only cursory knowledge of the Fallout setting is not a problem. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged, but not required.

One seat is being reserved. General RSVPs open 7/29

Content Warning: while we will be using safety tools such as lines &amp; veils, there are some elements of the setting to be ready for: the horrors of survival, humanity’s inhumanity, implicit cannibalism, etc. But it is also a kind of goofy setting so it won’t be entirely grimdark.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. I would very much like to record this, but I will confirm this with the players. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
