    <title>4 and 20 Blackbirds (Multiple Lady Blackbird Offerings)</title>

    <description>***Lady Blackbird***  is a free-to-play swashbuckling adventure game.

&gt; *Lady Blackbird*  is on the run from an arranged marriage to Count Carlowe. She hired a smuggler skyship,  *The Owl*  , to take her from her palace on the Imperial world of Ilysium to the far reaches of the Remnants, so she could be with her once secret lover: the pirate king Uriah Flint. HOWEVER, just before reaching the halfway point of Haven, The Owl was pursued and captured by the Imperial cruiser Hand of Sorrow, under charges of flying a false flag.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; EVEN NOW, Lady Blackbird, her bodyguard, and the crew of The Owl are detained in the brig, while the Imperial commander runs the smuggler ship’s registry over the wireless. It’s only a matter of time before they discover the outstanding warrants and learn that The Owl is owned by none other than the infamous outcast, Cyrus Vance.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; How will Lady Blackbird and the others escape the Hand of Sorrow? What dangers lie in their path? Will they be able to find the secret lair of the pirate king? if they do, will Uriah Flint accept Lady Blackbird as his bride? By the time they get there, will she want him to?

This event is scheduled to run for 4 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.

The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct will be in play and safety tools including Open Door, Lines &amp; Veils, and the X-Card will be used.

This game is a one-shot and will be offered at 3 Different times.
