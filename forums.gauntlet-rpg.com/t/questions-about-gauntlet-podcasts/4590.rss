    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/questions-about-gauntlet-podcasts/4590</link>
    <description>Hi, folks.

I&#39;m trying to get my head around the current and former podcasts produced by The Gauntlet.

I believe that there are three Gauntlet podcasts in production at the moment: 

The Gauntlet Podcast
[122 episodes: 2015 - present]

+1 Forward 
[91 ep, May 2016 - present]

Fear of a Black Dragon 
[52 ep, July 2017 -present]

Are there others I&#39;m missing?

Previous podcast series were...

Discern Realities 
[60 eps, Dec 2016 - Feb 2019]

Farrier&#39;s Bellows 
[19 eps, Feb 2019 - Jan 2020]

Trophy 
[7 eps, Sep-Nov 2019]

Pocket-Sized Play 
[73 eps, Apr 2017 - Dec 2018]

Comic Strip AP 
[100+ eps, Jan 2016 - Mar 2018]

Are there other Gauntlet podcasts I am not aware of?

My understanding is that... 

DR ended because Jason &amp; David ran out of things to say about Dungeon World.

FB ended because Zack &amp; Diana&#39;s lives have changed and they just don&#39;t have the time to do the podcast anymore. 

The Trophy podcast was intended as a limited series.

Are there any plans for new ones?

DR is how I found The Gauntlet in the first place. (I kind of miss it!)</description>

              <p>Yes, thanks. I actually started listening with Scenic Dunnsmouth since it was the oldest episode available on the feed. But you know how podcasts are, they sometimes have an archive of older episodes. I am trying to find out if there might be any older episodes (which are no longer on the feed). I’m not sure but I believe I heard Jason and Tom reference older modules they reviewed together, prior to July 2017. Maybe they did reviews together on another venue or something? Cheers!</p>

              <p>It’s run by one of our Slack members. The audio is only pulled from the videos submitted for inclusion in the Gauntlet YouTube playlists and the weekly roundup posts on the Gauntlet Blog, which are both publicly available. Consent for public consumption is gathered by the facilitator of each session from all players, and anyone who opts out of public distribution of the video is automatically opted out of the podcast version as well, since the video is never publicly released. Hope that helps!</p>

              <p>Who’s running that? There might be some issues with content permission since The Gauntlet doesn’t, like, own people’s recordings (that are on personal YouTube channels) and, idk where all the links are being found, but not everyone lists the videos publicly, so they may not want the audio to be public, either.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s any version of this world where this would actually be a problem, but it’d be good to make sure it’s socialized in Gauntlet spaces and people have a way of opting out.</p>

              <p>Hi, folks.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get my head around the current and former podcasts produced by The Gauntlet.</p>
<p>I believe that there are three Gauntlet podcasts in production at the moment:</p>
<p>The Gauntlet Podcast<br>
[122 episodes: 2015 - present]</p>
<p>+1 Forward<br>
[91 ep, May 2016 - present]</p>
<p>Fear of a Black Dragon<br>
[52 ep, July 2017 -present]</p>
<p>Are there others I’m missing?</p>
<p>Previous podcast series were…</p>
<p>Discern Realities<br>
[60 eps, Dec 2016 - Feb 2019]</p>
<p>Farrier’s Bellows<br>
[19 eps, Feb 2019 - Jan 2020]</p>
<p>Trophy<br>
[7 eps, Sep-Nov 2019]</p>
<p>Pocket-Sized Play<br>
[73 eps, Apr 2017 - Dec 2018]</p>
<p>Comic Strip AP<br>
[100+ eps, Jan 2016 - Mar 2018]</p>
<p>Are there other Gauntlet podcasts I am not aware of?</p>
<p>My understanding is that…</p>
<p>DR ended because Jason &amp; David ran out of things to say about Dungeon World.</p>
<p>FB ended because Zack &amp; Diana’s lives have changed and they just don’t have the time to do the podcast anymore.</p>
<p>The Trophy podcast was intended as a limited series.</p>
<p>Are there any plans for new ones?</p>
<p>DR is how I found The Gauntlet in the first place. (I kind of miss it!)</p>
