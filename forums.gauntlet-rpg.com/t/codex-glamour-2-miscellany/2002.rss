    <description>Hey Gauntleteers, it’s time to crowdsource the miscellany for Codex - Glamour 2. This miscellany is called “Three Dozen Dangerous Fashion Fads.” Submissions need to be a single sentence, or 2-3 short sentences. By submitting here, you&#39;re agreeing to let us use it (you&#39;ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader.

Here are some examples:

“The drab Mourning Beetle’s carapace is the key ingredient in a wildly popular shade of iridescent blue. The preparation method is a fiercely guarded secret, but some imitators’ products are nearly identical, albeit with much higher chance of toxicity when exposed to sunlight.”

“Some of the most outlandish of the Court have taken to sewing bits of iron onto their finery. Whether to show a contempt for death or their power in the face of its effects, who can say?”

“Reflective clothing and makeup are not only striking but unparalleled in thwarting passive surveillance technology. Rumors of people going further and using theirs to focus light into heat rays are almost certainly scaremongering gossip.”

P.S. If you want to be credited as something other than the name on your forum profile, let me know! DMs here or on Slack (@ryanm) are fine for that, but please keep submissions in this thread.

              <p>The Yardstick™ brand and the style named for it enjoyed a brief but intense popularity.

Only the extremely attractive could look good in Yardstick; everyone else looked utterly ridiculous.</p>

              <p>It’s widely agreed that the odious Duke Felchington was the first nobleman to decorate his codpiece with an actual, functional blade as opposed to the horn-like protuberances and baroque spikes that have increasingly become the fashion among his universally-loathed coterie of oafish young aristocratic second sons.</p>
<hr>
<p>The rapid evolution of AI DermaPets has resulted in an unforeseen complication. When pets whose historical ancestors were adverserial (predator/prey, alpha male pairs, etc) come into close enough proximity, the mechanized implants exhibit behavior outside their programmed parameters. Thus far, no one has been hurt, and the SkinPets magacorp has issued a brand-wide recall. Any DermaPets implantees should immediately report for removal of the malfunctioning accessories.</p>
<hr>
<p>The septugenarian Lady Terwilliker was the first of the Debutantes Eternal to be found dead at the end of a ball after no one realized she had passed. The current rage for ‘architectural accouterment’ of course meant that she remained standing thanks to her foundational skirts, and her mirrored mask merely reflected other ball-goers’ looks of concern back at them. We’ve assigned servants to keep a closer eye on the other ladies.</p>

              <p>Mycelian Grass from the oceans of Mora is very much like human hair in texture and feel, but it comes in a variant of vibrant colours. So now there are wigs, hair extensions, fake beards and even chest hair made from it, and the slightly higher incidence of paranoia and hallucinations occuring in the wearers of those products surely is nothing but a statistical glitch.</p>
<p>Printing out the best insults from Twitter and having them ironed onto t-shirts was supposed to be a funny little fad, but this is what started out the university riots in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Witches of Gonbar punish the criminals in their demesne by giving them the ears of donkeys, rabbits or other animals. They did not foresee that this would become a fashion statement in the neighboring state of Chlar and now have to deal with foolish fops trampling across their land, committing minor infractions of the law and demanding “cat ears” or “lion ears”.</p>
