          <blockquote>
              <p>THE PITCH: “The players take on the role of Revenants - souls returned from the dead; former citizens of a dungheap named Brimstone, who have returned to save their kith and kin in that benighted town. Along the way, they remember things about their past lives, the town, and the folks they left behind.</p>
<p>Revenants don’t remember much about themselves. They may have been anyone - farmers, laborers, thieves, the law, - but now they have returned in their idealized badass form, with weapons and powers to match.</p>
<p>They’re back to clean up Brimstone, because the town has been taken over by demons. Not the metaphorical demons of drink, greed, and lust that plague every podunk in that vast wilderness, but honest-to-heaven evil entities from beyond the Gates of Hell.”</p>
