    <description>The session is scheduled for 3 hours. The session will be recorded. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.


The Legendary Ship Vargas has transported mortals to the divine-continent of Elpis, sailed through the waters of the Dead World and survived the Apocalypse.

It was thought lost, but its awakened will was actually wandering the lands, looking for heroes worth of being its crew.

You are such heroes.

And these are your voyages.


This will be a Guided game with a GM and 4 players.

The game will use the Gauntlet-created setting of the City of Kriusthos.


This game abides by the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy. The X-Card and Lines&amp;Veils will be in use as well as any other safety tool players deem necessary.
