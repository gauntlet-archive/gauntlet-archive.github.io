    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/11/07/crowdfunding-collection-154/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #154, including every tabletop rpg project started between 10/15 and 11/01&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite having limited internet access, I composed a collection, which I translated later than usual. I hope you still enjoy the projects started between 10/15 and 11/01.

Let’s start with the project named &lt;b&gt;Xenolanguage&lt;/b&gt;. The game from the makers of Dialect explores understanding an alien language. Like in, a language spoken by aliens. The game offers quite unique and distinct mechanics, that enable a myriad of unique playthroughs. I am fascinated by the mechanics, the topic of languages and highly recommend having a look. I got the project on my list. If you want to explore an Edwardian England, check out &lt;b&gt;The Dee Sanction&lt;/b&gt;. A rules lite game in which you play mages who managed to escape death by trying to catch other people who can enact magic. The 60 page spanning zine is well worth having a look. If you always wanted to marry OSR and d20 modern, checkout &lt;b&gt;Heavenscape: Reloaded&lt;/b&gt;. The game provides you with a whole multiversum to explore.
Which gets us neatly to the genre of Urban Fantasy. The funding of the second edition &lt;b&gt;Urban Shadows&lt;/b&gt; is a true juggernaut of the genre. The award laden Powered by the Apocalypse game by Magpie Games sees the players playing various supernatural types in one group. Thus, it will make a nice addition to my love for the WoD which usually focus one kind of creature. I backed it, check it out. I am somewhat tempted by &lt;b&gt;SHIVER&lt;/b&gt;, maybe because of the fanged thumbnail. The game aimes to have you play pulp, horror or scary tv shows and movies. A neat idea that uses unique dice. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Dark Places &amp; Demogorgons 5e&lt;/b&gt;. Capitalizing in the Stranger Things hype by bringing the genre to D&amp;D. The project looks great, and if you fancy the nostalgic 80s, check it out.
If you rather play in the future, after an apocalypse and fall of society, check out &lt;b&gt;The Wildsea RPG&lt;/b&gt;. It presents a world covered in a verdant green and with a quite aggressive nature. The illustrations are lavish and d6 system ~ inspired Belly of the Beast and Blades in the Dark among others ~ is quite interesting. I am having an eye on it, and do recommend it. The &lt;b&gt;Neon Lords of the Toxic Wasteland&lt;/b&gt; present a more classic take on the postapocalypse. The game is B/X based, the setting has the description „ultra violent“ and the illustrations remind me of 80s/90s comic. Check it out, if that sounds like your cup of tea.
For afficiandos of gamebooks, there’s the &lt;b&gt;Metal Heroes and the Fate of Rock: A Rock/Comedy Gamebook&lt;/b&gt;. The book is a translation of a German gamebook and comes with a soundtrack. It’s cool, I am tempted by the German version and do highly recommend it. &lt;b&gt;What Dreams May Come&lt;/b&gt; is a more classic gamebook, that offers a surreal horror story alongside beautifully haunting illustrations. Take a look.
There are many other cool projects. Fans of the MÖRK BORG RPG might like to checkout the sourcebook &lt;b&gt;Strange Citizens of the City&lt;/b&gt; and play through the &lt;b&gt;The Masticator Gate&lt;/b&gt; campaign. B/X enthusiasts can check out the &lt;b&gt;Lost Triptych&lt;/b&gt; campaign. If you like some fancy dice, take a look at the &lt;b&gt;Metal Bullet Dice&lt;/b&gt;. Well and you can place them right into the little wings of the dragon figurines of &lt;b&gt;Draconis Vitae Dice by Geek and Artsy&lt;/b&gt;. Though maybe you just want a &lt;b&gt;Grizzly Owlbear Plush&lt;/b&gt; during corona?
You’ll find those and many more projects in this list:
