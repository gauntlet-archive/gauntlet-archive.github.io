    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/11/27/crowdfunding-collection-185/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #185, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/15 and 11/22&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The collection is back with quite some magazines in the context of the #SideQuest. One cool ttrpg I want to single out is &lt;b&gt;LATAM&lt;/b&gt;. I missed it in the last collection, thus added it back. It’s very cool and you should have a look.

The post should have been published on Sunday yet somehow I missed it. Thus it covers last week (see timeframe)
