    <description>I like making things, and this caught my eye. You have probably seen the annual Zine Quest prompt from Kickstarter, already here https://www.kickstarter.com/zinequest It is a call for RPG Zine-like projects.

Is anyone excited about this here?

Is here the right place to talk about this?</description>
