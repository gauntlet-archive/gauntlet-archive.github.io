    <title>5-6 player PbtA options?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/5-6-player-pbta-options/8504</link>
    <description>Hi Team,

I was just doing my first prep for a Brindlewood session with friends I&#39;ve been playing Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective with. 

Started with the Session One instructions, only to see for the first time

&gt; Avoid playing BRINDLEWOOD BAY with five or more players.

This was the first I&#39;ve seen of a player limit - totally on me for preparing too late.

Do you recommend any PbtA  that are good for 5-6 players?
Is the limit because Brindlewood doesn&#39;t play well, or because PbtA doesn&#39;t play well, at that size?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/sandy">@Sandy</a>, much appreciated. I did decide to blast through and see how it turned out - I’m expecting at least one or two players to drop out - we are a board game group and I don’t know that everyone will make the transition.</p>

              <p>Imo, most pbta games are fine with 5-6 players. It’s a little harder to share the spotlight around all the players than with a smaller group, but not really any more than it is in trad games. I’ve run Brindlewood Bay one-shots for a group of 6 before without a problem.</p>
<p>You might find you need to go a little harder on giving them conditions, because you want the characters to rack up conditions to push them to engage with mechanics like Crowns and the Vulnerable Move.</p>
