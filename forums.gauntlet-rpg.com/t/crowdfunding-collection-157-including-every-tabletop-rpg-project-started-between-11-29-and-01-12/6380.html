          <p>I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2021/01/12/crowdfunding-collection-157/" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Crowdfunding Collection #157, including every tabletop rpg project started between 11/29 and 01/12</b></a>.</p>
<p>Happy New Year! Following another long break, I am back with a fresh and illustrated collection.<br>
I still remain at the clinic, yet finally could free some time and had the energy to go back to it. Sadly, a lot of projects have been started and ended between the last and this collection. I mentioned the ended projects I am aware off, at the end of the illustrated „live projects list“.</p>
<p>Considering there are currently 77 projects live, 19 English ttrpgs, I will keep the prologe to a few projects that caught my eye. Which enables me to get the list out today, and not at Sunday when likely a ton of new „make 100“ projects have been started.</p>
<p>I personally backed the <b>The Monsters Are Our Heroes Print Tabletop RPG Zine</b>. It offers a neat little game, in which I can play a Vampire ~ or a different monster ~ at a rather nice backer level and it looks like it is made with enthusiasm. Check it out. Then my eye caught the game <b>Those Who Wander</b>. While I am not such a big fan of „fantasy“ games, the inclusive approach to character creation caught my eye. As did the colorful cover of <b>Space Aces: TNG (The New Guidebook).</b> Which is a neat, little science fiction game. I am as well tempted to back the gamebook <b>Alba – an Open World Adventure Book</b>. It’s presentation is interesting, and the additional material is rad, maybe I’ll back it later on.<br>
Fans of the Powered by the Apocalypse system should check out <b>Babes in the Wood RPG</b>, a game about having halloween themed adventures for kids, and/or <b>ABYSS</b> which rather induldges in supernatural Action-Horror ala Castlevania or Hellsing. <b>Rune and Steel</b> mostly caught my eye, as it kind of looks like the German tabletop rpg juggernaut The Dark Eye, though I haven’t delved deeper.</p>
<p>You find those and a great many more, cool, worthy, projects here:</p>
