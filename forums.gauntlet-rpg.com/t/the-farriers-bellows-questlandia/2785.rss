    <description>It&#39;s a new Farrier&#39;s Bellows, and this time we&#39;re saving the kingdom with Hannah Shaffer&#39;s Questlandia!
We talk fantasy, collaborative worldbuilding, and systems of discovery in this wonderful GMful game of lands on the brink of collapse and their sometimes unlikely heroes. 
Enjoy, and let us know what you think of this game and episode!

              <p>Hey! Just caught up on the whole show, excellent work both of you for breaking things down, discussing them, and explaining them. I very much enjoyed your show and will be running Out of Dodge for some friends in the near future!</p>
<p>Re: you not liking that questlandia tied who you formed a bond with where you were sitting in real life. Instead of forming a relationship with the person on your left, maybe you can hand out playing cards and you formed a relationship with whoever pulled the card 1 higher than yours?</p>
<p>Say you pulled the 3, so you form a relationship with whoever pulled the 4, and the person who pulled the 2 forms a relationship with you.</p>

              <p>This is more centered on <em>Questlandia</em> than <em>The Farrier’s Bellows</em>, but for those who found the game interesting, the designers (Hannah and Evan) have been developing a second edition/sequel game and documenting it on a podcast called <em><a href="http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/design-doc/" rel="nofollow noopener">Design Doc</a></em>.</p>
<p>This new version has unfortunately just recently been put on hold a bit in favor of another game that’s going to be faster to bring to market, but they’ll pick it up again, and the backlog is still interesting if you haven’t heard the podcast before. It’s really been interesting to me to hear their process of going back over an old design and seeing what they want to keep or not, and what they thought worked or not. If you’ve got extra pod bandwidth in your life and are interested in game design nitty-gritty, I think it’s worth a listen!</p>

              <p>I listened to this episode yesterday and enjoyed it very much. So far, The Farrier’s Bellows team has done a great job on every episode I have heard. I would love to have a follow up to this episode covering Noirlandia as well.</p>

              <p>I’d seen Questlandia mentioned here and there before but never with enough detail to make me understand what made it special the way you did in this episode. So thanks for adding yet another game to my ever growing list of “I have to get around to playing these some day”… <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
