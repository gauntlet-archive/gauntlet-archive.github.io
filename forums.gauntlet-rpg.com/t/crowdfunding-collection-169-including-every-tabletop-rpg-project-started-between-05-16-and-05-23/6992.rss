    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/05/23/crowdfunding-collection-169/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #169, including every tabletop rpg project started between 05/16 and 05/23&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

I hope you enjoy the Whitsun holidays, if you are celebrating or get the monday off. The week saw a nice number of very cool crowdfundings being launched, who’ll you find in this collection.

Let’s start with &lt;b&gt;Into the Motherland&lt;/b&gt;, a science fiction roleplaying game, set in an afrofuturist world. The design of the world, and variation of cultures ones character can be from, looks quite cool, and once you’ve backed it you will get a look upon the rules with the quickstarter of the game. The creators appeared competent in their presentation, and I recognize BD Walters as well as That Bronze Girl from various VtM Actual Plays. All this to say, I do have faith in the team. Check the project out! I’ve flagged it for later evaluation, whether or not I can squeeze it into my budget. Something the game has in common with &lt;b&gt;Somniauts&lt;/b&gt;. In this game, the character will unravel mysteries by using weird science to delve deep into dreams. The rules are available on the games website, and are influenced by games like The White Hack and The Black Hack. I do like the illustrations, which reference the dreamscapes of Dali, Escher and Moebius. Thus I do recommend checking the game, and supporting it. &lt;b&gt;Knock-Down Drag-Out&lt;/b&gt;, at the other hand, is a rather „down to earth“ game, set in the „Country Noir“ genre as introduced by works like Ozark or Winter’s Bone and others. I like the illustration, and the rulelite game system has a card based mechanic for chases, which apears to be cool. Check it out, if the genre speak to you. To raise up the mood, let’s take a look at &lt;b&gt;The Awfully Cheerful Engine: An RPG of Action Comedy!&lt;/b&gt; project, The game is set to emulate 80s games, and thus offers pulp action from Indiana Jones, to Urban Fantasy and onto Spaaaace. Basically everything from Danger Mouse up to Rick &amp; Morty. The system is a ruleslight d6 pool system, that sports 4 attributes. The character creation can be experienced with their website and is fun. While I am not really a fan of the genre, the project enticed me to consider it – if I had the cash for it. Then there’s the superheroe game &lt;b&gt;Good Guys Finish Last&lt;/b&gt; by Postworldgames Jim Pinto. Well, the revival of the existing game. While I am not a fan of the genre, or the title, it looks good and I trust Jim Pinto to deliver, based on my experience with his other projects. Thus it might be well worth having a look.
If you are a fan of Horror, you should check out &lt;b&gt;Collector&lt;/b&gt;. The micro rpg offers a post-apocalyptic setting, in which the characters try to get enough gold, to pay the goddess Ubato of the Black River, to escape the limbo into the beyond. The game is designed to work as a „gateway“ game to entice casual players of the gritty campaign and get them hooked. The structue and mock up of the game looks fine, the 2d6 based system fast. I am tempted and recommend it. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;A Shape in the Dark&lt;/b&gt;. The game offers to experience horror stories akin to those shared at campfires, and aims to attract people to play, who weren’t previously interested. I like the idea, and quite a bit of the design, but won’t watch the Actual Play to see it’s system.
Of course there are more cool projects. Most notable, at least to my interests &lt;b&gt;The Story Engine: Deck of Worlds&lt;/b&gt;. A set of cards meant to enable players and game masters to create worlds and settings at a moments notice. I loved, backed and rejoiced in the final delivery of the previous Story Engine project. While I might have to back out, purely because of budget reasons, I wholeheartedly recommend the project. There’s a project to fund the &lt;b&gt;Ludonarrative Dissidents&lt;/b&gt; podcasts. Which will be hosted by Ross Payton, Greg Stolze and James Wallis. An interesting combination. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;LEDGES&lt;/b&gt;, basically things you can hang onto your GM screen, to have a kind of shelf, which looks rather cool.
You’ll find those projects, and quite some more, in this collection:
