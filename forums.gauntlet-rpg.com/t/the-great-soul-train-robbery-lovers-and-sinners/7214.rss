**On the road to hell there was a railway line. An express train to the infernal city of Dis, crewed by furies and carrying treasure and souls to damnation. You’re going to rob it.**

You’re a motley crew with mixed motives. Gunslingers, snake-handlers, homesteader widows... Desperados all. When you attempt to rob the train to Hell, will you claim your prize, or be overcome, damned, or broken by the heist?

To celebrate the release of the [physical zine version](https://great-soul-train-robbery.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders) of my game [The Great Soul Train Robbery](https://cloven-pine-games.itch.io/the-great-soul-train-robberyzine-edition), we will play a thrilling one shot of allegorical Weird Western shenanigans.

NUMBER OF SESSIONS: This is a one-shot session.

DURATION: 3.5 hours

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 4 players total. One slot is reserved for a subscriber to my Substack, [Murmurs from the Cloven Pine](https://clovenpine.substack.com/).

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: We will use CATS, the X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and the Open Door Policy. This event abides by the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

SET UP INFO: We will play over Streamyard. Expect a set-up email from me about a week before the session, with a link to a Google sheet character keeper.

BREAKS: two ten-minute breaks (and more as requested)

RECORDED: Provided all players give permission, the session will be recorded and posted to the Cloven Pine Games Youtube channel.

PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: No, rules will be taught in play.
