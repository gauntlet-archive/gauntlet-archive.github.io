    <title>For a PbtA hack, how much should you explain about the system?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/for-a-pbta-hack-how-much-should-you-explain-about-the-system/3001</link>
    <description>I can see two schools of thought about this:

1. Assume this is your reader&#39;s first PbtA game, explain it all.
2. Assume most people are finding your game through the community, reference core materials and give a sense of the basics.</description>

              <p>I like that everyone has sort of their own twist on the same concepts. This is really helpful. I’m working on writing a full PbtA system at the moment, so I assumed I’d need to spell everything out, but his is affirming. I have a lot of ideas of little 10-page hacks and if the purpose is bite-sized changes, it’s hard to figure out where to draw those lines.</p>

              <p>In early versions <em>Fourth World</em>, I only included things that changed from the sources I was hacking, with a note that those sources were “required reading”. Feedback told me that this was confusing. Eventually, my conclusion was this: if you are hacking some of the basic moves of a game, even if your text only mentions the stuff you are changing, you should have a reference sheet that contains the original moves and those you have changed together. That way, players don’t have to guess, or go back and forth between books.</p>
<p>The more generic sections like “How to Play” or the bestiary, I left out, and no one seemed to mind.</p>

              <p>I was thinking less about moves and more about the general “how to play this game” part.  Stuff like, “When does the GM make a move?” and the like.  Which isn’t strictly speaking an “advice” section, but is still something that you probably don’t need to write on a hack.</p>

              <p>I try to make games which are standalone as much as possible, since I can’t assume they’ve played any particular prior game. And honestly, at some point, it’s just less laborious to say “it works like X” rather than “okay, so take Move X from this game, but change Y and Z”.</p>
<p>Unless you’re talking about advice sections, etc. In that event, I’ll sometimes leave that out unless I’m going to put a lot of effort into the game. But I feel that (with the exception of early playtest stages that aren’t intended to be widely distributed) any text I put out there should be theoretically playable by anyone who stumbles across it.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what I try to get at, it’s a World of Dungeons hack that I may or may not flesh out or revise in the future, dashed off very quickly. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1qyOaT4kFBcl9QbiCxC0p1ZBE9D8m76fDW3jY69Jfc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1qyOaT4kFBcl9QbiCxC0p1ZBE9D8m76fDW3jY69Jfc/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

              <p>Calris seems to have the right of it, I think.  If you’re making something that’s never going to be “published” (Say, because it’s based on an IP you don’t own) you can probably skimp on this stuff – though if you do, I’d suggest SAYING so.  Put in a clause that says “Hey, I’m not going to explain how Powered by the Apocalypse games work; I’m expecting you to know that.  If you don’t, go check out &gt;insert game here that you think does the best job of teaching how to play PbtA Games&lt;”</p>
<p>But even that is unnecessary at early playtesting stages, since you’ll be running it, and you’ll know the people you are handing it off to to run at middle stages.</p>
<p>But yeah. If it’s a “hack” and billed as such, then I think most people won’t see it as a complete game anyway.</p>

              <p>If you’re thinking of the game as a “hack” then making the text as small and compact as possible is a good idea, since you can focus what’s special about <em>your</em> game rather than recapitulating a bunch of material found elsewhere. That said, most successful games that get published <em>will</em> need to explain it all, so if you’re pretty sure you want to publish the game then maybe go ahead and start on figuring out how to explain things.</p>
<p>In practice, I would write a minimal hack, try play-testing it and sharing it with folks who are familiar with the space, and then based on its reception consider writing a more “complete” game as a follow-up.</p>
