    <description>EDIT: Thoughtless original name edited out in the title, until I can come up with something better.

*This has an unfortunate name collision with &quot;Stars and Wishes&quot;, which is another tool that I love, but please note that is not what I&#39;m talking about in this thread.*

The idea is that, in a long term campaign, you make a metagame vote for certain things to appear or not to appear in the game, by quickly annotating your character sheet.

Sometimes, in games, we take a high score / skill value / advantage, because we want that thing to feature prominently, and show off how awesome our character is compared to others with lesser ability.

Other times, we take such defensively: I want a high willpower because I dislike losing control of my character, or etc.  We take &quot;wealthy&quot; because we don&#39;t want to keep track of every penny.  We&#39;re trying to bar our characters from having that kind of problem.

The gameplay technique is simple.  Put a star on your character sheet next to the things you want to show off (to let your PC &quot;star&quot; in the game), and an X next to things you want to avoid (to &quot;bar&quot; them from affecting you).  The GM can then look for patterns in what the players want to have challenged or featured, and what they want to avoid.

Note that &quot;bars&quot; are different from Veils: veils are something you don&#39;t want to see in the game at all.  Bars are something you don&#39;t want to affect your character.

See also &quot;Play Unsafe&quot; for some thoughts by John Wick on encouraging the former type of play, and discouraging the latter (super-summarizing John&#39;s ideas, so probably misrepresenting him a bit here).</description>

              <p>In the 3rd edition of Over the Edge, every character has a question mark trait, that you identify by just putting a big <strong>?</strong> on the sheet next to it. This is a trait that the character wants to think of themselves as, but might not be. So a Generous PC is actually generous, but a Generous? PC might not be under some circumstances. A Heartless? assassin character highlights their struggle with the morality of killing, and might eventually decide to abandon that life. That sort of thing. It’s a flag for the GM and other players to challenge that trait, to tempt them to see if they’ll act differently in some situation. In my experience, it worked really well.</p>

<p>My only concern is that it might encourage the sort of play culture which expects the GM to do all the “work” and to please the players. Sometimes that’s appropriate, but for most games and most tables, I consider it an unfortunate and unhelpful approach to gaming. Start with the assumption that the GM is there to please and entertain the players, and you have a potential really fragile and difficult play culture.</p>

              <p>EDIT: Thoughtless original name edited out in the title, until I can come up with something better.</p>
<p><em>This has an unfortunate name collision with “Stars and Wishes”, which is another tool that I love, but please note that is not what I’m talking about in this thread.</em></p>
<p>The idea is that, in a long term campaign, you make a metagame vote for certain things to appear or not to appear in the game, by quickly annotating your character sheet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in games, we take a high score / skill value / advantage, because we want that thing to feature prominently, and show off how awesome our character is compared to others with lesser ability.</p>
<p>Other times, we take such defensively: I want a high willpower because I dislike losing control of my character, or etc.  We take “wealthy” because we don’t want to keep track of every penny.  We’re trying to bar our characters from having that kind of problem.</p>
<p>The gameplay technique is simple.  Put a star on your character sheet next to the things you want to show off (to let your PC “star” in the game), and an X next to things you want to avoid (to “bar” them from affecting you).  The GM can then look for patterns in what the players want to have challenged or featured, and what they want to avoid.</p>
<p>Note that “bars” are different from Veils: veils are something you don’t want to see in the game at all.  Bars are something you don’t want to affect your character.</p>
<p>See also “Play Unsafe” for some thoughts by John Wick on encouraging the former type of play, and discouraging the latter (super-summarizing John’s ideas, so probably misrepresenting him a bit here).</p>
