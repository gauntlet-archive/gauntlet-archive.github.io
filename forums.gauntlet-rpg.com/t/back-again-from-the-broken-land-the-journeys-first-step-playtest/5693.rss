You are little people who walked into a big war. The Doomslord’s forces were gathered in the Broken Land, and for some reason your small fellowship played a key role in their fall. Now, laden with stories to tell and burdens to bear, you set off on the journey home. But the Doomslord’s Hunters are still out there, and it’s a long way to walk…. Back again from the Broken Land.

Back Again from the Broken Land is a one-shot PbtA game of small adventurers sharing stories on a long walk home. It is inspired by the emotional, even bittersweet stretches of  *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. It is being developed for publication in Codex: Cozy.

1 slot in this session is reserved for Leah.This is a one-shot playtest session. It will be recorded and posted to Youtube if all players agree.

Aiming for a story of homecoming, with elements of fantasy and adventure and melancholic interpersonal moments, rated PG-13. The X-Card, Open Door Policy, and Lines and Veils will be in use. This event abides by the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

The Doomslord has fallen, but, for a trio of small adventurers, there is still a long walk home ahead. Liriel the Shepherd, Belby the Burglar, and Harding the Turncoat set out on their journey, during which they will share stories, reveal burdens, and brave perils. Will they elude the Hunters? And how will our fellowship have changed by the time we reach home?<br>
