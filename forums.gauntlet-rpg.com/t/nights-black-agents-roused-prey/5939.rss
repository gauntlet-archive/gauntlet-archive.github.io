**If you&#39;re someone who has not played with me as a GM and are interested in playing this GMT friendly game, message me.**

This is for five December sessions of  *Night&#39;s Black Agents*  (with modifications, see below). These will be GMT Friendly at 2PM Eastern on Tuesdays. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged but not required. Because of the schedule uncertainty the December holidays creates (especially this year), we will try to be extra generous making things work or running with a partial crew. 

I will be reserving one seat for someone who hasn&#39;t played with me as a GM. General sign ups open Dec 10th. 

*Night&#39;s Black Agents*  is Pelgrane Press&#39;s GUMSHOE game of burned spies against Vampires. We will be playtesting a modification of the rules. [You can see notes on that here](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-tinkering-with-spies-a-nba-retuning). Rules will be taught. Note that it is still a game with a good deal of crunch from the number of skills/abilities. This is a dry run for the rules in anticipation of doing a longer-play quarterly game in 2021. In session one, we’ll choose discuss tone and safety, create characters, and set up our cell. CW: vampirism, political intrigue, betrayal, supernatural horror, violence.

**The NBA Pitch:**

&gt; *The Cold War is over. Bush’s War is winding down.*

&gt; *You were a shadowy soldier in those fights, trained to move through the secret world: deniable and deadly.*

&gt; *Then you got out, or you got shut out, or you got burned out. You didn’t come in from the cold. Instead, you found your own entrances into Europe’s clandestine networks of power and crime. You did a few ops, and you asked even fewer questions. Who gave you that job in Prague? Who paid for your silence in that Swiss account? You told yourself it didn’t matter.*

&gt; *It turned out to matter a lot. Because it turned out you were working for vampires.*

&gt; *Vampires exist. What can they do? Who do they own? Where is safe? You don’t know those answers yet. So you’d better start asking questions. You have to trace the bloodsuckers’ operations, penetrate their networks, follow their trail, and target their weak points. Because if you don’t hunt them, they will hunt you. And they will kill you.*

&gt; *Or worse.*

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
