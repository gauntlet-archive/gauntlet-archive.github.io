    <title>Only the Damned - Spire (8 sessions)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/only-the-damned-spire-8-sessions/7395</link>
    <description>CONTENT WARNING: Violence, murder, cults, religion, colonialism, racisim as part of setting, betrayal.

DESCRIPTION: You have joined the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress, a paramilitary cult that worships a forbidden goddess, and sworn in blood to avenge the wrongs placed upon you and your people. You have made an oath to fight the high elves, to subvert and capture their resources, and to take Spire back into dark elf hands once more. 

It is a cruel and thankless task, and your family would most likely report you to the city guard if they found out what you did at night. But it is a task you have sworn to perform, and you will kill for it. You will die for it, too.

The story of Spire is one of rebellion. You and your friends will become drow freedom fighters, clawing back their city through subterfuge, sedition and brutal violence. They will have to risk their relationship with their community to save it from the cruel overlords of Spire – what are they prepared to lose to liberate their people? Who are they prepared to hurt, or kill, to see Spire under drow control once more?
