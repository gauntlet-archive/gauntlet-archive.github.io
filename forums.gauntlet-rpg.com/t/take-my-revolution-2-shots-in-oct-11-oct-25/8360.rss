    <description>Your school is beautiful but incredibly strange. There are those who call themselves Swordblooms, and they Duel each other in order to impress World&#39;s End and gain the Divine Sword...in doing so, they will create a revolution. They&#39;ll change the world, for the one they love. You are now one of these Swordblooms. The school is alive, and it won&#39;t let you leave. You have no choice. You must duel and take your revolution! Or you can fade away into the shadows...

*Take My Revolution*  is a GMless casual TTRPG heavily inspired by the anime *Revolutionary Girl Utena* , where students who possibly aren&#39;t actual students duel with swords and hearts in a surreal high school that&#39;s possibly not an actual high school, with mechanics based on the frameworks of *Mobile Frame Zero: Firebrands* and the use of playing cards from *The King is Dead*.

**Touchstones:** Revolutionary Girl Utena, Revue Starlight, Gideon the Ninth, Thirsty Sword Lesbians

**Duration** : 2 sessions, 3 hours max, with 5 to 10 minutes breaks on the hour. Participation in both sessions are encouraged but not required.

**Number of Players:** 1 more player needed, with a spot reserved for Thomas Manuel.

**Content Warning** : PG-13, Teens getting injured, teen angst and emotional turbulence, possible teen romance if desired. 

**Safety Tools** : Lines &amp; Veils, The X-Card, and an Open Door policy. All of which will be explained before the session. It will be run under the Gauntlet Code of Conduct

**Venue** : Zoom. The session will not be recorded. 

**Contact** : Players will receive an email about a week before the first session to confirm the commitment and receive links to play materials. If you sign-up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
