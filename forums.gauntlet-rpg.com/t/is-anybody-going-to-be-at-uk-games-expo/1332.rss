    <description>(Mods, please feel free to delete/close this if not appropriate, or a direction you don’t want discussion to go)

I wonder if there is anyone UK based here who is planning to be at the UK Games Expo at the start of June? I’ve never been before, but I’m considering it, and it would be nice to say ‘hi’ in person if anyone here is going to be there. 

Cheers</description>

<p>I wonder if there is anyone UK based here who is planning to be at the UK Games Expo at the start of June? I’ve never been before, but I’m considering it, and it would be nice to say ‘hi’ in person if anyone here is going to be there.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
