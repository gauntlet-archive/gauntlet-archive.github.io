    <description>Tell us about your current game design project. Choose just one, even if you&#39;re working on more than one. Choose the one you most want to tell us about, whether it&#39;s currently at the conceptual stage, final polishing, or anything in between.

Tell us whatever you like, but definitely these three things:
* The elevator pitch
* Why you&#39;re excited about it
* What your hopes are in relation to it

Thread rule: no unsolicited critiques or &quot;that sounds a lot like this other game&quot; posts.</description>

              <p>Yeah i have dreamed of creating something interesting. Esepecially i was interested in mobile apps, but frankly i don’t have enough skills for doing this, so i try to get from various sources, like Youtube. I even tried to enter some professionals courses and this was in vain. I always liked those apps where you can play casino games and even placing bets like melbet registration <a href="https://melbetonline.pk/registration/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://melbetonline.pk/registration/</a> and wanted to create something like this…always, maybe i need more time, who knows</p>

              <p>I recently launched a game jam, and really hope that some of you take an interest. I also posted it on the Gauntle here: <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/2nd-coinsides-adventure-sparks-game-jam/8700" class="inline-onebox">2nd CoinSides Adventure Sparks Game Jam</a> Cheers.</p>
<p>The jam is for 1500-word modules that should fit in just about any running campaign. A bit like a side quest or extra bit of lore, all centered around a coin. There are prizes and I’m working hard to make it fair and fun.</p>

              <p>Heya! First time poster after long time listener to Jason Cordova on various channels.</p>
<p>I’m working on a game called KNIGHT. People are Arthurian style knights, questing about the land for the High Queen of Avalon. The game involves collab style gaming, where players are creating a map filled with adventure points between them before going back to their knightly house and doing various things. It’s also got a generational aspect - knights only get about ten adventures before they retire, to which you play your heir.</p>
<p>It’s rules light, with a mix between procedures as in Blades in the Dark and a player facing version of Into the Odd. I was influenced strongly by Trophy’s consequences, but have yet to integrate anything with it. Had a few playtests and ran a full campaign of 30 sessions with my after-school kids.</p>
<p>The process has taught me the pain and joy of layout design and youtube tutorials for InDesign :D.</p>
<p>If people are interested I have a <a href="https://fullyarmouredgames.pixpa.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">webpage</a> and a <a href="https://discord.gg/Kvy3MwJG" rel="nofollow noopener">discord</a> .</p>

I’m thrilled with Rev.Ivre  because it’s a drama workshop in disguise. I hope to learn workshop animation know how.<br>
With Used to fly and Core, the feeling is more serious and open. These are about collaboration, wrapping my head around another person’s project and crafting high ludic potential material. A new territory for me, working on Setting, a bit daunting, the wind of adventure.</p>

              <p>I have written most of my Shonen puzzle game in one-page modular mini games. I am now working on the most meta part, that’s how to weave character arcs stepping stones (think Jenna Moran’s Chuubo or Nick Wedig’s Baba Yaga) and external conflicts.</p>
<p>I’m excited because it’s a Grail to me: linking external and internal conflict in a symbolic way (exact analogy would kill the interpretative game). Few games do this, and my “formula” promises to be accessible enough <strong>and leave sufficient cognitive space to do fun things with the ext/int symbolic relationship.</strong></p>
<p>I hope to hold that promise. I just passed the major obstacle. The problem I see from here is first to pick apart the advice from the rules (eg: stakes setting and raising when how and why). And second to keep it simple, although character progression, harm, and other important subsystems all want to converge into this play phase: Conflict. This will take some analysis (feels like playing Tetris with subsystems). But writing-wise, this means I have too much ideas and they’ll keep coming. All problems I love having.</p>
