    <title>Did You Get To Play Anything Cool At Gen Con?</title>

    <description>Well, it&#39;s been a little over a week since Gen Con 2019 wrapped and I imagine that everyone has had a chance to decompress and return to the ordinary world. Now that we have had an opportunity to reflect on our experiences there, did anyone get to play anything noteworthy at Gen Con?

I played in only one game. By the time I went to register, all the games I wanted were sold out. I bought some generic tickets, but this was my first year going to Gen Con without having 16+ hours of programming to run, so I was treating the experience more like a vacation than I usually get to. I&#39;m not gonna lie, I took a lot of sweet, sweet naps in my hotel room.

The one game I did get to play was Unspeakable: Sigil &amp; Sign. It was run off the books by some of the developers. It&#39;s a game that is being released as a partnership between Make Believe Games and Cubicle 7. It uses Mark Rein-Hagen&#39;s newish Axiom system, and it&#39;s the third game they are releasing with that engine.

I&#39;ve never played an Axiom game and while I found the presentation to be lovely (lots of cool little cards and dice and stuff to interact with), it&#39;s still very trad with lots of key words written on both sides of the card and which face is up means different things, and the position of the word on the card has different interactions. I dunno, it sort of left me cold.

The conceit behind Unspeakable is that you play the cultists in a Cthulhu horror scenario, rather than the investigators. That is really the best part of the game and I think that as a concept it still has a lot of promise. It was a little White Wolf-y with lots of little factions you can belong to and stuff like that.

I&#39;m really bummed I missed Casket Land at Games on Demand, but my copy is on it&#39;s way. Anyway, what did everyone here get to play?</description>

              <p>It’s brutal. This was my third consecutive year in attendance and I only made it out because to fancy friends of mine treated me to it for my 40th birthday. It’s just such a huge sink hole for my resources, it makes it really difficult to commit to annual attendance.</p>
<p>That said, it’s a great con and I get something a little different out of it each year. Without trying to sound trite or melodramatic, each year it shows me a different face. And I love that about Gen Con. In the early 2000s I went to SDCC three times in a five year span I think. This was before the Marvel movies took off and really changed everything, though the tenor of the show was already in flux when I started attending. Every year that I went I felt like I was having a regurgitation of the previous year’s experience. It was a copy of a copy of a copy. Very quickly it became not worth the time, money and effort.</p>
<p>But Gen Con is always new and exciting. This year I went in and I wasn’t even super jazzed for new releases or anything. Yet I ended up have a poignant trip, seeing new things and learning.</p>

I was interested in how it replaced dice rolls with cards, and how that actually added to the tension of the situation!</p>

<p>Jim, you’re too kind—not only was I thrilled to have you playtest the game, but the Indian food was indeed delicious. I had fun running the session, and I certainly aspire to the <a class="mention" href="/u/jmstar">@Jmstar</a> comparison being accurate. It’s definitely a hyper-specific game (as the title suggests, it’s hard-framed to the three day period of Halloween, All Saints’ Day, and All Souls’ Day) but I hope it enables gamers of all stripes to tell stories about darkness, faith, and sisterhood. More info <a href="http://Bit.ly/AutumnTriduumList" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, for anyone interested.</p>
<p>The rest of my GenCon leaned heavily towards <a href="https://www.magpiegames.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Magpie Games</a>’ offerings, including running one session of <em><a href="https://www.magpiegames.com/masks/" rel="nofollow noopener">Masks</a></em> and playing in two (exploring some new playsets from <em>Masks: Unbound</em>, Spiderweb and Iron Red Soldiers). Plus I got to play my first session of <em><a href="https://www.magpiegames.com/epyllion/" rel="nofollow noopener">Epyllion</a></em>, a game about young dragons and the magic of friendship. I was an art dragon (the Crafter playbook) who gave out magic tattoos.</p>

              <p>GenCon is work for me, so I only had 3 slots free to actually play in. I ran <em>Cartel</em> in the Magpie Room on Thursday and Friday. Both games were with folks who had never played, and signed up out of curiosity.  They were both plenty of fun and a welcome respite from the day in the hall. <em>Cartel</em> is basically done, and I’m looking forward to the full release later this year.</p>

              <p>It’s a game by Alex Dodge that is in playtest and I don’t think it is generally available. It’s a hybrid tabletop/larp about a heist gone wrong; you play a crew that got away with the money from a bank robbery but one of you is definitely a rat. Through some very clever mechanics, you try to figure out who set you up, and then kill them. It takes about an hour and is really fun.</p>
<p>Similarly <strong>Gander Reveal Party</strong>, by Chad Wolf, is in playtest and <strong>The Fobolex Interstellar Corporate Retreat</strong> is by myself and Alex Roberts and has never been released, I don’t think.</p>
