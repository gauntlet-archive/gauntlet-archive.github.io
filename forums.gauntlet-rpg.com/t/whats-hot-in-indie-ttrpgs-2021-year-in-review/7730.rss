    <description>I&#39;ve posted online the What&#39;s Hot in Indie TTRPGs 2021 - Year in Review. This is over 10,000 words of opinion and data with contributions from over 20 designers, podcasters and roleplayers as to the games and trends of the last year, plus data from Kicktraq, DriveThruRPG and itch.io. With nearly 3,000 standalone ttrpgs released and 4 projects each raising more than $1m in crowdfunding, the increased digitisation of play and the emergence of entirely new (or very old) design philosophies, what were the ttrpgs and trends of 2021 for you?
