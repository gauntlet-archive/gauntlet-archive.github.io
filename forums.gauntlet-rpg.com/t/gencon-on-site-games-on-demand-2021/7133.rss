    <description>GenCon On-Site Games on Demand 2021 - Any Interest?

Hey Everyone,
GenCon On-Site Games on Demand is looking for in-person GMs to run games at  **GenCon 2021**  in  **Indianapolis, IN**  from  **September 16-19, 2021** . We need enough GMs to run 3 concurrent tables of games in the morning and afternoon of each day of the convention and would love to have you join us!

How Does Volunteering Work?
* All games need to be 4 hour one-shot tabletop RPGs
* We will also need help hosting the registration table.
* We will make schedules work as best we can. The earlier you let us know the better.
* We do our best to make sure everyone gets a table, but sometimes there won’t be enough players for every GM to run a game in every slot they’d like.

Time is of the essence. We need to confirm the event with GenCon ASAP.

Thank you!
