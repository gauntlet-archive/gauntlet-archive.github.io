This is a one-shot run of Bed, Bath and Beyond, a one-shot hack of Brindlewood Bay about an elderly gay couple investigating disappearances in their Bed &amp; Breakfast by [Alicia Furness](https://twitter.com/AliciaFurness) and [Chris Bisette](https://twitter.com/pangalactic) published in [Codex Starlight 2](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/codex-magazine.html). This is a single session of four hours in length. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (March 7th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our session. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants. 

Brindlewood Bay is a game in which a group of elderly women, members of the mystery book club the Murder Mavens, investigate murders in the town of Brindlewood Bay while a secretive supernatural conspiracy plots in the background. In Bed, Breakfast and Beyond, two players will play as an elderly gay couple running a Bed &amp; Breakfast, from which people have been disappearing in strange circumstances. Together you will explore the eerie Room 3, and the history of your relationship with one another.

Content Warnings:  This game centres on the investigation of missing persons and a looming supernatural mystery. There may therefore be themes of horror and/or violence. This game is also centred on a romantic relationship between the two player characters, and this is fundamental to the premise and mechanics of the game - if this is a situation you are not happy roleplaying then this is probably an unsuitable game to play. (Though we will not be eplxoring any graphic sexual content). We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
