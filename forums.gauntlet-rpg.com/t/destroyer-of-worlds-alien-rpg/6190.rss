Destroyer of Worlds - ALIEN RPG

NUMBER OF SESSIONS: 4 sessions on Thursdays in January

DURATION: 3 hours

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 4

CONTENT WARNING: Body horror, graphic violence, swearing, military, corporate greed

DESCRIPTION:

&gt; All right, people, what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed? Another glorious day in the corps! A day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm. Every meal’s a banquet! Every paycheck a fortune! Every formation a parade! I love the corps!
- Sgt. Apone


In Destroyer of Worlds, an ALIEN cinematic scenario, you play a marine in the Colonial Marines. But when you’re suddenly pulled off your ship and put on special assignment to track down four AWOL marines in an oil mining colony on the edge of rebellion, you might be in over your head. An insurgency is building on the ground, and the threat of a UPP invasion is looming. Find the missing marines, don’t start a riot, get out. Sounds easy right?

**A note on cinematic scenarios in ALIEN:**

ALIEN cinematic scenarios are created to give the feeling of a movie. They are structured in a 3 act arc, and the scenario has a series of pre-scripted events. Additionally, players take on a pre-generated character. Each character has its own personal agenda that they should act towards in each act, and these agendas may come into conflict with other characters.

Players should be open to playing a pre-generated character with a set agenda. The story we’re telling is how these characters handle the quickly developing events while pursuing their agenda.

SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: With player permission we’ll use Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card, and script change, and open door tools

RSVP OPEN ACCESS TIME: Dec 9th, 6:00 PM EST

TECH: Roll 20, Zoom or equivalent. Links will be sent one week prior to game start.

BREAKS: Breaks at the top of the hour for 5 to 10 minutes and as needed.

RECORDED: With permission and assuming I can learn how to do that before we play. I’ll ask each participant in private to okay the release of videos.

PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: None. Rules will be taught as needed.
