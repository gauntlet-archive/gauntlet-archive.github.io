    <title>Against the Dark Conspiracy: Riddles in the Dark</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/against-the-dark-conspiracy-riddles-in-the-dark/7344</link>
    <description>The all access time for this game is September 8th, 2021 at 3 pm EST.

Here are four November sessions of the soon to be released Against the Dark Conspiracy by esteemed Gauntleteer, Alun Rees.

In Against the Dark Conspiracy, the players are Operators who previously made their living in the world’s overlapping crime and espionage communities. During that time they discovered the Vampire/Demon/Fae Conspiracy beneath the skein of what passed for normality and have banded together to fight against it.

We will use lines and veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door to stay safe while we play.

This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. We will use Streamyard and a character keeper to play. I will record and post the session to Youtube if all players consent.

I am reserving a seat for the game’s designer Alun Rees.

Session 1: Sunday November 7th, 2021. 9 am EST.
