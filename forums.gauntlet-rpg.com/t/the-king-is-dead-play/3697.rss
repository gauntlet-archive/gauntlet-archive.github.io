    <title>The King Is Dead Play</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-king-is-dead-play/3697</link>
    <description>Our usual group got together last night and, not feeling the heaviness that is our Blades campaign, pulled out my still in shrink copy of The King Is Dead.

This is the $45 copy, so it included everything except a deck of cards. I had been smart, and stashed a standard deck in the box as soon as I got it. Hooray for past me.

This game was _wonderful_. The intrigue and muster cards put something right in front of us we could use; the lands, units, and troops on the table flavored every interaction and triggered imagination. These bits made it feel like we were overseeing military campaigns, while having no system relevance at all!

Marvelously done. This game has come a long ways from when we first playtested it years ago, and the bits -- while initially somewhat confusing -- really helped.</description>

<p>Note: there are open-source resources and assets to duplicate the majority of material in the boxed set, just hover your mouse over a playing piece to see the flavor text!  But, the mod is missing the manual (necessary to play) and Intrigue &amp; Muster decks for the players (supplemental material).  I might fix the latter, I don’t plan on providing the former.</p>

              <p>My beginner tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s fun to make a mess in this game: persue reckless action, change loyalty on a whim, just go for it.</li>
<li>Don’t feel pressure to improvise a ton of dialogue.  Letting the prompts guide the scene keeps things tighter and more interesting.</li>
<li>Don’t have every player in every scene: you’re not leaving someone out, you’re letting them be the audience.</li>
<li>Cut a game sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>Know which cards are useful (high cards and Jacks) but don’t obsess over it.</li>
<li>Reincorporate themes and concepts the other players introduced whenever possible.</li>
</ul>

              <p>I had a really fantastic game of this at BigBadCon last weekend… Sebastian Baker was one of the players (he was Dillestone, I Oake… He called me out in a Heated Argument and I subsequently led a War on him in the penultimate Game, it was awesome).</p>
<p>It was so good that I was inspired to put together a Tabletop Simulator mod of the game, using a variety of open-source assets from other parts of TTS (I had to do <em>something</em> while I waited for my box to arrive).  It’s basically not much more than some chess pieces and little wooden tower tokens over a map, but it also has dynamic counters the audience can tick for the games that require a tracked score or rounds and player cards for Qualities and the like.</p>
<p>I gotta find some folks to run it with.</p>
