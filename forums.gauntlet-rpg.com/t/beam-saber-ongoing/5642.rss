*Beam Saber* is a game about the pilots of powerful machines in a war that dominates every facet of life. They are trying to do their time and part, and get out physically and mentally intact. The organizations that perpetuate The War through all of known space are too incomprehensibly huge to take down. There is no “winning” The War, there is only surviving it. Hopefully you can make things a bit better before you move on.

Session 0 will probably be entirely faction, squad, pilot and vehicle creation - we may not get any in-character scenes! If you&#39;re excited about world-building, *please* sign up for session 0! If you&#39;d rather just create a character and jump into an established setting, please *don&#39;t* sign up for session 0! This will, ideally, be a rolling campaign, so there will be plenty of opportunities to come and go.

&gt;**System:** [*Beam Saber*](https://austin-ramsay.itch.io/beamsaber) by Austin Ramsay
&gt;**Duration:** Three hours
&gt;**Breaks:** Three breaks, once every hour (10 minutes)
&gt;**Tools:** [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/), [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/), [Roll Dice With Friends](https://www.rolldicewithfriends.com/) (or whatever RNG/dice you&#39;d like)
&gt;**Recording:** Yes, but made public only if granted consent by all of the players
&gt;**Attendance:** Signing up for session 0 automatically signs you up for session 1. Signing up for all other sessions is ideal, but not required
&gt;**All-Access Time:** [date=2020-07-28 time=00:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
&gt;**Content Warnings:** War and violence
