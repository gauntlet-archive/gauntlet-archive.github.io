Emperor Palpatine is dead. But the Empire still controls parts of the galaxy and it&#39;s up to the New Republic to free more planets from the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. To accomplish this important goal, the New Republic needs new pilots.

That&#39;s **you**.

Two weeks ago you graduated from basic flight training. You know how to fly a starfighter, but now you&#39;re standing at attention on the flight line in a run-down docking bay at the far end of Vanguard Station, your flight suit still clean and your lieutenant&#39;s bars still shiny, a canvas duffel bag of belongings at your feet, and a veteran pilot yelling at you about how she&#39;s going to turn you into a finely honed weapon capable of blasting TIE Fighters and making attack runs on Star Destroyers.

Welcome to Starfighter Academy.

-----------------------------------

For June, I&#39;m running a mashup of  *Storm Furies*  and the setting of Tachyon Squadron - Starfighter Academy.

-----------------------------------

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. If you&#39;ve seen The Mandalorian TV show, that&#39;s a good inspiration for what&#39;s happening in our setting.

Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

**CW: Violence, Imperial power abuse, violence. Strong emotional ties.**
**System**  : Paragon system
**Duration**  : Four 3 hour sessions
