    <title>Queensday - Captain Blood&#39;s Odyssey</title>

    <description>The Caribbean, 1688. Filled with Spanish galleons, French frigates, and English merchant ships, ripe pickings for pirates under the command of Captain Peter Blood. You, and the rest of the crew, were English rebels who were transported to the West Indies colonies, and fled the plantation for a life of piracy on the high seas. But the winds of war in Europe begin to shift the sails of ships upon the Caribbean. If England offered you clemency, would you sail under their flag once more?

Captain Blood&#39;s Odyssey is a Descended From the Queen game based on the 1922 novel, Captain Blood: His Odyssey, by Rafael Sabatini and designed by Deirdre Donlon.

This one-shot session will run up to three hours, probably a touch shorter. The session will be run on Zoom and may be recorded for my own review, to improve as a facilitator, if all players agree; and may then be posted on YouTube (again, only if all players agree).

The expected tone is somewhere from PG to R, with possible references to violent or traumatic acts committed on or by the players. We will be establishing Lines, Veils, and Ask First at the start of session, as well as the X-Card and Script Change tools and the Open Door policy during play.

7pm EST, Sunday March 29.
