    <description>So, I&#39;ve been thinking about this subject for a while, about how to create games that feel to the player in a way that is resonant with what the character is experiencing. Dread is a great example, using the Jenga tower to generate the tension and suspense of the horror scenario. There has to be ways of handling this with just dice and cards, though, and that&#39;s something I&#39;ve decided to explore at more length in a blog series.

[The first of that series is now available.](https://goatsongrpg.wordpress.com/2020/02/12/designing-for-gamefeel-introduction/)

I am definitely interested in hearing people&#39;s thoughts about this subject, and have a few discussion questions if you want to engage but aren&#39;t sure where to begin.

Which games have elicited the strongest emotional responses from you?
Which games have felt the most distant from the action during play for you?
What kinds of experiences and feels are you interested in seeing further explored in this series?</description>

<p>My personal preference for resolution probabilities for games (especially RPGs) should fall within some memorable handful of choices.</p>

<p>You pull poker chips out of a fanny pack, hoping for the right color. Not everyone will have a fanny pack to make this easy to play at home, but what a cool concept! As mentioned by sjbrown way back on Feb 12th, this is also a cool way to display the resolution to the table, or for the McElroys, to a gigantic audience.</p>
<p>One of the games I’m working on is inspired by this. Instead of poker chips in a fanny pack, some players eat from a mixed bag of normal skittles and sour skittles. I haven’t playtested this yet, but I’m really looking forward to the players’ sourface expressions revealing whether their action succeeded <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Reading this post made so many things click for me, <a class="mention" href="/u/meinberg">@Meinberg</a>! Thank you! I was particularly interested in the idea of questions being ‘tools’ you can move around the table like an index card or die, and your breakdown of how dice mechanics can enhance or diminish the inherent “mystique” of polyhedrals.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about how <em>Imp of the Perverse</em>  uses a die mechanic that really slows the game down, but counterbalances it by having every die represent something particular and consequential: That’s not just another Black Die, that’s whether or not you let this stress spill over into your relationship with your estranged sibling! Also, the slowness of the die mechanic forces the player to deeply consider what’s going on in their protagonist’s head…very appropriate for psychological horror.</p>
<p>It also made me think about how a die mechanic can encourage asking questions, or how dice and questions blur into each other: In <em>Spire,</em> if work or familial experience have granted you the “Library” domain, you get a bonus when acting in a library, moving through library-like spaces, and having conflict with librarians. You’re constantly asking “Where am I from?,” “Where is this NPC from?,” “Do they move through the world in ways I can understand?” And that constant questioning encourages building a character with a history and a strong communal context, rather than a stoic loner.</p>

              <p>Actually came here to shout out Zombie World! I played it and goodness me, the bite deck makes that game tense as anything.</p>
<p>For other games I’d point out, Fall of Magic’s physical edition does a very good job with this. It’s a combination of gamefeel and conveying rules through components. Everything from the box to the canvas scroll the game is printed on to the weighty metal counters and hessian bag they’re stored in makes the game feel aged and timeless, which absolutely informs how people approach their play. The counters are double sided (with related concepts on each side, e.g. an egg and a bird, a river and the sea, a sword and that same sword shattered), and while never explicitly mentioned in the rules, I haven’t seen a game yet where a player hasn’t played around with that idea - flipping the coins to decide how the proceed, or changing permanently to the coin’s other side to show a change in their character’s outlook and there’s only 5 coins (mandating a maximum of 4 players). The scroll brilliantly conveys a sense of mystery and surprise as you steadily unfurl it, and subtly hints to the players that they should be advancing (even though it does give you the option to loop back at places). Best of all it has a brilliant reveal moment when somebody moves their token to the torch icon and says “what does this torch mean?” at which point you clear the table, and flip the scroll to reveal a whole other map printed on the back.</p>
<p>I’d also point towards the intersection between LARP and TTRPGs. Mist Robed Gate has an (actual, real) ornate knife in a silk cloth as the key resolution mechanic, with you pressing the side to your friends’ skin to show your character threatening them, or sticking the knife through their character sheet to show an attack.</p>
<p>I can’t find it right now but a very recent horror RPG has the mechanic that if you look behind you or into the eyes of your possessed friends, you are possessed by the fictitious monster prowling around the room. Which also reminds me of 10 Candles, where the game ends when all the candles on the table go out, which can be due to character action, or somebody breathing too hard, making the players very tense.</p>

<p>It’s based on Apocalypse World, but doesn’t use dice or playbooks. Instead, it uses various decks of cards.</p>
<p>There’s a mechanic in it that wrenches up the tension… The bite card. If you get the bite card, your character becomes a zombie. And in order to achieve various things, you have to draw from the deck containing the bite card. The more cards drawn from that deck, the more likely someone is to draw that fateful card.</p>
<p>Listening to the podcast, it sounded like the players were deeply immersed in the story they were unfurling. And the bite card was a palpable presence throughout play.</p>

              <p>Didn’t get a chance to read these updates until now - this one is great, useful terminology and discussion that I don’t really have any questions about or critique of.</p>
<p>All that’s left is to answer your questions:</p>
<p>A) <strong>What sort of modal game experiences have you most enjoyed?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed OD&amp;D &amp; B/X for a long time, the jarring shift from thinking through puzzles, negotiation, and exploration to fast messy and dangerous combat marks that combat as a sort of climactic collapse of player choices into risk and danger.</p>
<p>B) <strong>What games with nonmodal rules have felt like the biggest stretch to you?</strong><br>
The memory that jumps out is Torchbearer, simply because it’s so close to the classic D&amp;D editions I mostly play in tone and goals.  I liked the ideas of the system, but in practice the identical game of bonus stacking and sheet interrogation for chopping a ghoul with an axe and using elven memory and dance to make it remember its former life and despair felt way too gimmicky. I totally love the idea of forcing the undead to remember life as a means of overcoming them - but forcing everything into the same mechanical sausage casing is jarring.</p>
<p>C) <strong>Do you often feel like you have trouble knowing how long to talk at the table?</strong></p>
<p>At times, I tend to be verbose and have a fairly strong personality.  Luckily I’ve had a lot of training in meeting management and public speaking - so I think I usually manage it unless I’m super excited and/or drunk (which is not entirely uncommon when playing games).  As a GM I find I do better at controlling pace and managing the flow of play while giving quieter players an opportunity to be involved as well - but I worry my descriptions can run long.</p>

<p>Which games have felt the most distant from the action during play for you?</p>

<p>Old <strong>Deadlands</strong> had combat mechanics that sometimes required seven rolls with different types of die and numbers just for one action. I had to abandon that game, and that was under the period where I was really resistant to heavy systems.</p>
<p><strong>Fiasco</strong> have a random generated ending, and I never felt that the randomized ending seldom mirrored what actually happened during the session. In some sessions, quite the opposite actually.</p>
<p><strong>Dogs in the Vineyard.</strong> The die mechanics is too slow and calculating and breaks up the dialogue too much. That said, the mechanics of making all dogs (type of inquisitor) be like assholes is brilliant, but that’s more a case of emergent complexity (when all components forms one result) rather than what happens in the moment - in the system - enforces the how the game feels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which games have elicited the strongest emotional responses from you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://froudounich.free.fr/PDF/PSYCHODRAME-FINAL01.pdf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Psychodrame</a> is using Dogs mechanics, but in a better way. The cards (instead of dice) are hidden, which makes the dialogue flow better, because the opponent can’t peak and the dice and do tactical calculations. Another thing is that you don’t use things that defines you, but feelings - which are easier to play out. I highly recommend to try this game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/dont-rest-your-head-2/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Don’t Rest Your Head</a> actually frightened me; I mean, them mechanics themselves did that! It’s using a form of <a href="https://www.mechanics-and-meeples.com/2013/05/28/psychology-of-gaming-loss-aversion/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">loss aversion</a>, and I wished more games did that. <strong>Dread</strong> is using it, in a way. Depends on how much you want to bend the definition, because the Jenga tower is more about the tension of drawing than the tension of making a choice, as in DRYH.</p>
<p><a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Montsegur 1244</a> is a game I haven’t played through, but I heard that people sink immensely into the role and thinks that death is a better way than abandon their religion … and this from secular Scandinavians. It’s a game without resolution mechanics, and I could tell that they followed the structure of how to achieve flow/immersion - based on Nordic LARP theory. The game pumped information to the players that they had to interpret based on their characters. By doing that, you’ll get immerse into the game.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17821/svart-av-kval-vit-av-lust-i-will-answer-any-questions" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Svart av kval, vit av lust</a> (Black of Despair, White of Lust) is a Swedish game that is what Vampire should have been. The mechanics consists of letting your beast go to solve problems, and to sometimes obey the beast’s inner desires (suggested from other participants). The mechanics creates a “If I do what I want, I will tread a path of blood” feel, and I even had one guy screaming “Fuck you” (both upset and amused) to the rest of the participants for the choice he had to make.</p>

              <p>Back to the original topic, I LOVE this idea!  I really enjoy Dread for this reason.  I would love to try more games with this sort of feedback loop.  I have yet to try Dust Devils, I think the idea of using poker hands as the mechanics to a western rpg is genious!  I haven’t played it but Ten Candles is a fascinating concept using candles to represent life force and how much time is left.</p>
<p>I think examples of these where they still use dice are Mothership and the San Jenaro Digest 1 game Clerics.  Mothership because of the stress -&gt; panic feedback loop.  The more stress the character has the more likely they are to panic and you feel this as a player.  Clerics because of one simple rule, whenever the PC’s as a player try to boss  around the NPCs (the rest of the party) because the clerics are the “wisest”, the rest of the party is to act deliberately opposite.  It really gives the feel that the clerics really are the only clever characters and the DM is a dick <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I think a good example of using improv rules to give a specific game feel is A Penny for your thoughts.  I haven’t played this one either but the idea of giving improv prompts to recover your memory is inspired.</p>
<p>Personally, I would most like to see more games with gambling or bidding mechanics.  What’s riskier than risking your life on an adventure?</p>
<p>I am currently designing a game about old west using the old west gambling game Faro.  It is my first attempt at something like this.  The idea is that going west in that time was a gamble thus the gambling game mechanic supports that feel.  Faro by itself is a dull game like roulette but the gambling chips are the metacurrency for the story.  If you lose all your chips, your character dies.  If the player doubles their chips  they get to dictate their happy ending.  If the deck runs out and the players are somewhere in between they get varied success / failure and varied agency in finishing their character’s story.</p>

              <p>very fair points, I’ll concede Burning Wheel is not a perfect example of what we are talking about, but I will say the tag system is more flexible than you assume. Yes, having the “big hat” tag will provide you a bonus to the scenario provided, but not having the tag is not a no-go. If you narratively position that your character had procured a big hat, you could convince the GM that they can use that hat for a one-time bonus, and if you consistently rely on it, there are mechanics that let players nominate you for the “big hat” tag at the end of any session, at which point you get more control over when you can invoke the tag.</p>
<p>To bring it back on topic, I think BW has better GameFeel than DnD because while its mechanics are less dense, they are also more rigorously defined in what they are meant to simulate (both by explicit author writing and in what “flavor” the mechanics are given). You could can run a game involving a group of characters travelling a fantasy world and building bonds to achieve some lofty quest in either game, but BW will do it better (opinion) at the expense of doing less things than DnD (ignoring how well DnD does those additional things).</p>
<p>I think there is something to be discussed in how much lifting “genre” or flavor does towards reinforcing mechanics. If Night Witches was pitched as a game for playing as pilots (no era specified) it would do what it was designed to do just as well but would be more difficult for players to “tune in” to the ideal play style.</p>
<p>Perhaps the difference between indie and classic design is how much genre is defined versus implied by the mechanics? Night Witches lays out what it’s about very explicitly, which does wonders for helping players enter the desired headspace. DnD and BW rather define their setting through the content. DnD definitely assumes the name is doing a lot of heavy lifting and BW’s rules only imply (there are rules for hitting people with medieval weapons, casting spells, and creating characters of different fantasy races), but I don’t recall it outright saying “this is a game for LotR style adventures” beyond listing LotR and other related stories in its bibliography.</p>

              <p>It again strikes me - and I say this without malice or judgment on either tradition - this is a gulf between classic design and indie design.  The indie games I am most inspired by are “small” - something like Night Witches (I haven’t read Dread, but I’ll believe you about it) where the genre does a lot of the lifting both with player expectation and the narrow scope allows rules to be perfect for just the one thing, the one scenario. This is great when one can manage it well, and yeah a concise explanation of intended play helps there.  I think it’s much less successful and much harder in “big” games - hence the greater importance of rules for crisis situations and rule voids.</p>
<p>Thus I don’t follow with your Burning Wheel example, though I don’t deny it does this for some people. My impression from your example is that it would lean too far into the gamification world for me.  E.G.  The need to have “big hat” as a tag to do big hat things throws player problem solving back to their sheets (though inventory/supply does the same thing in a classic game) and more importantly to the mechanics.</p>
<p>So say we had a big hat situation - the player wants to scoop up fish in a pond - darting minnows.  Obviously a big hat would be helpful for this.  In a classic game the hat might be an inventory item, it might be minimally described, and it might not even be an inventory item - clothing doesn’t tend to be in systems with tight encumbrance  rules (and this sort of thing is the source of one of those silly grognard debates: “do suits of armor come with helmets?”).  The availability, suitability and volume of the hat would be briefly discussed - dependent on established setting and character fiction - in a setting where everyone wears turbans - no big hats, a character that always talks about thier outrageous hair - no big hat, pseudo Renaissance faux France - big hats abound.  A GM at a table with good trust between the players might say yes - you can catch 3D6 minnows a turn with your big hat, might say nah, your hat is too clumsy to catch the fast minnows, might create a DEX test or something.  In the Burning Wheel version I presume that much depends on the character having a pre-picked “Big Hat” tag - and more tellingly that untagged things aren’t up for negotiation - because everything can be tagged.  Even with the Big Hat tag one falls into using the general test mechanic, there’s less space for a no needed test result (it’s minnows in a pool - it shouldn’t be hard) because there’s an assumption of tags offering bonuses to resolving things. The general test mechanic also well be its nature be mechanically bland - a problem Meinberg aims at resolving.</p>
<p>I agree skill systems in classic games are also problem - and for much the same reason - I like to limit them to fairly broad categories for things that cannot be reasoned through by the players or and GM (“Sleight of Hand” or “Tinkering” instead of “Pick Locks”) rather then throwing everything to a “Skill Test” in the way say 5E (and contemporary trad games more generally) manages to. Note as well that with those skill heavy systems the same problem of exclusion and presumed lack of competence in related areas can be a big issue - if it’s not on the skill list you can’t do it.</p>
<p>This is of course off the general topic.  Call me mostly convinced - but still leery of the ability to hit that medium of well defined play and gamefeel promoting rules in a “Big” system.</p>

              <p>Very fair, to avoid falling into the pit of a Death of the Author debate, I will specify that my comment “what the designer claims they want to emulate” is whatever explicit text is written in the rulebook. If the rulebook does not contain any text along the lines of “this is a game about X and Y”, then that complicates the vision presented, or at worst is a reveal that the author did not consider the game to be about anything other than being a ruleset.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not saying you’re wrong (I mostly agree with the statement) but I will refer back to my first post in this thread that thinking about game design as a balancing act between dichotomies will inherently limit what designs we create. I think <em>Dread</em> has outrageously expansive <em>and</em> evocative rules, with the caveat being they only cover situations that occur in a horror story.</p>
<p>I think <em>Burning Wheel</em>’s trait system is both more expansive and more evocative than the systems of DnD; by allowing you to tag basically anything (from “100-yard stare” to “big hat”) it allows more flexibility in what you can bring to conflict resolution without trying to be universal in the way DnD tries to be (for example, DnDs skill list is so clogged with minutia because it is inherently limiting in what actions are available and thus how it forces its players to approach problems). Compared to BW which says “you’ve got a background in sailing? Ok yeah, that totally means you get some mechanical advantage to dealing with ropes”.</p>
<p>Of course that’s not to say simpler is always more evocative. Finding mechanics that satisfy both is way harder than finding mechanics that only satisfy one, and those mechanics will be inherently more restrictive and exclusionary because they are more specific (for example, <em>Dread</em> is inherently limiting to physically disabled players)</p>

              <p>All this seems sensible - of course the tricky part is “what the designer claims they want to emulate”.</p>
<p>It seems to me there’s so much in designers assumed community of players, play style, ethos of play and such that designer assumptions almost invariably derail the designers goals.  Accepting this, basically the proposition that designer control will always be limited (not GM or player control - designer) I wonder about the limits of mechanics that support a specific playstyle, I wonder about unpredictable consequences, about resisting vs. accepting hacks.</p>
<p>For example,  Meinberg talks a bit about D&amp;D style d20 combat - how it lack a visceral impact that Meinberg wants in hand to hand combat.  That’s pretty valid, old D&amp;D combat is highly abstracted - dare I pun “bloodless”. It feels a bit, as Meinberg again suggests, calculated, like a sniper’s shot.  So the immediate thought might be: “I’ll just use multiple combat mechanics and systems that feel different!  One for ranged combat, one melee and one for fisticuffs!”  Yet now your game has three combat rulesets, and worse you’ve set an expectation that other kinds of combat (giant robot fisticuffs, mounted charges, dueling) should all have combat mechanics of their own.  Suddenly there’s a 400 page ruleset about combat, and you’ve developed a tactical combat game.</p>
<p>Simple rulesets are more expansive, but yup, less evocative - theoretically one could just have one system of rolls for everything, and every challenge (yes I know - Torchbearer) and the game risks being dull. Excess Gameification.</p>
<p>On the other hand you’ve got that tactical combat tome - maybe you add rules that feel right for every other area of endeavour and challenge as well even. How long does it take you to play through a walk to the park let alone a wrestling match with the pigeons? How much time is spent referencing rulebooks? Excess Simulationism.</p>
<p>Finding that balance is hard, and made harder the broader the game’s goals.</p>

              <p>“Fruitful Void” was exactly the phrase I was trying to remember!</p>
<p>As to mechanical reinforcement, I suspect we have more in common then not.  If I was writing a  “Witty Conversation” game I’d also want rules around bon mots and subtle insult. Though I think here the distinction exists between genre emulation and simulation.  For a genre game, and “My Dinner With Andre: The Roleplaying Adventure” would be very tight emulation indeed - the ethics of play an agreement among players to inhabit a single scenario and find the joy of play in how well they managed the emulation.  Simulation, such as the classic D&amp;D I like, has a different ethos, it wants (impossibly, unsuccessfully I’d argue) to offer a system that models anything, a whole world - almost any adventure genre.</p>
<p>Obviously the number of voids in a ruleset with that impossible ambition are greater then in a system like our Andre game.  I think though that the mechanics may take on a different texture and purpose as well.  As above Classic Ruleset mechanics seem to exist to only fill in the hard to rule on contested parts. I suspect this is intentional, or at least ingrained - the vestiges of a deep structure of wargame.</p>
<p>This goes beyond my initial thought, to which your response was more then adequate, and I’m still stumbling for how to express this distinction.  Ultimately though, or at least where I’m currently at, is agreement with the goal of intentional mechanics, but a growing sense of what “Gamefeel” - or what I like to call Ethos of Play and Design Principles encompasses.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your next post.</p>

              <p>Very interesting, my interpretation of <strong>a complete text should provide all the tools required for play</strong> was along the lines of <em>a complete text is one that, at a minimum, provides all the tools that would be required to play.</em> That is to say, a DnD style game that did not include rules for attacking things with weapons would be incomplete in that it does not deliver a mechanical basis for completing actions one would expect to attempt in that genre/style/aesthetic. TTRPGs are, at least to me, by definition esoteric; they can’t possibly cover the gamut or actions that will spring up during play, but in order to be <em>complete</em> and <em>elegant</em> the written rules should encompass the entirety of what the designer claims they exist to simulate (for example, consider a cyberpunk game with no rules for hacking, or a wild west game with no rules for duels, these are of course blatant example, but there are plenty of games that have rules cavities)</p>
