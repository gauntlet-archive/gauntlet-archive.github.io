    <title>Advice on a Flashback scene</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/advice-on-a-flashback-scene/4396</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to frame a flashback scene to flesh out a bond between two characters in a Star Wars World game I&#39;m running.

One character, Whomp Quince, is a twilek brain gearhead in a spider droid body that doesn&#39;t remember his life as a twilek.

The other is a rodian scoundrel pilot, Bozz Debrill, who we established knew Whomp before he chose to become a monk and put his brain in the droid and why he made that choice... But we&#39;ve left it to be fleshed out later.

I love framing flash backs that the players and myself turn into scenes relevant to the current story, but I&#39;m a bit stumped on how to handle this one.

I had an idea to frame scene where the two are in a starship race but am unsure how to guide to some sort of revelation about Whomp&#39;s past.

Do I just ask leading questions and create a montage with them based on the answers?

Do a create some sort of custom move for the race that result in choices that guide their narration?

Or something better that I haven&#39;t thought of?</description>

              <p>I love leading questions that lead to a montage, especially once you establish that their bond comes in part from the fact that they <em>both</em> lost the race, and have a reason to mutually dislike whomever won (by cheating them, of course, this is Star Wars).</p>
