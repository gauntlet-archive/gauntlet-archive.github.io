    <title>Thinking about a d5 system</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/thinking-about-a-d5-system/6829</link>
    <description>In the game I made recently ([Battlestreets](https://dannythewall.itch.io/battlestreets)), I used a dice pool mechanic, a basic &quot;count 4-5 as successes, and 6s as double&quot; with the idea that you build a power bar from the successes you accrue.

I still like that basic idea of using 6s as something special, then it occured to me, you could have a d5 system by rolling, say, 4d6, but remove the 6s -- they count as 0 for the total but are kept as &quot;power results&quot; to build a resource bank. What&#39;s left is a result from 0 - 20. What a sweet DnD-ish result with a nice bell curve!

I also like that 10 is the basic target number with a 55% chance a nice tier of difficulties at 12, 14, and 16,. (My attempt at [Anydice](https://anydice.com/program/219d7) here.) Unfortunately, if you use stat bonuses, you can only really get up to +3, as +4s will yeild almost a 90% chance rate, so it&#39;s not as granular as I&#39;d like it to be.

Still, I got excited enough about it that I wanted to share. :blush:  Is it unrealistic to think that this might be a thing? Even if the 6s removed got to be a cool resource, for stunts, etc., I think a lot of people might balk at it being a bit unconventional.</description>

              <p>This feels vaguely like a slight inversion of the dice rules for The One Ring.</p>
<p>In The One Ring, you roll a d12 (the “fate die” or something IIRC), and d6s equal to your skill.  You sum them all (Okay, fine, the d12 is really 1-10, zero and auto-success but we’re not talking about the d12 here I promise) and use the total to see IF you succeed… but then the number of 6’s rolled on the d6s are what tells you how WELL you succeed.</p>
<p>You’ve obviously gone for different maths, but I feel like the core conceit here is pretty similar.</p>

              <p>Finally, if you do make this a system, you can play with the 6s in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>For instance, for a temporary advantage that makes a relatively little difference but will <em>feel</em> very dramatic, allow a single ‘6’ to be kept and added to the other dice. A small change, in terms of probabilities, but will feel like a big deal if it comes up.</p>
<p>Allowing all 6s to be kept and scored would be a powerful “advantage”-type mechanic, which you could use to underscore some important themes in the game.</p>

              <p>I agree that adding four dice is not ideal, but fine for many/some groups.</p>
<p>It was bugging me that I know of a game that does a thing like this, but couldn’t remember.</p>
<p>It’s a bit of an obscure OSR game, called <em>Five Ancient Kingdoms</em>.</p>
<p>It’s less elegant than this idea, I think, but similar:</p>
<p>A basic roll is 2d6, but dropping any 1s (they’re counted as a zero, effectively). Roll two 1s, and you “zero out”, which is presumably quite terrible.</p>

              <p>I also like the the concept. I see two problems though:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can add four numbers together, but I really do not enjoy doing it. I assume that most role-players are the same.</li>
<li>Another disadvantage is that some of the players might hate the idea that rolling a six adds 0 to the outcome. I can hear some of my players: “The highest roll is the worst result plus some long-term bonus. Ah, man, that is demotivating!” It blame this on some weird evolutionary trait <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">

<p>Both problem disappear in a dice roller application.</p>

              <p>Haha well for now, it’s just “for” fun as I let the idea percolate. I like magical realism kind of stories and that intersects with supers and sci fi stuff, so I’m thinking this could be a kind of “build up your misfortunes until you unleash” kind of things. Taking away a 6 would more often than not lead to results below a target, so maybe call them “Danger” dice. In a player-facing game, this gives the GM a trigger (or allows a GM-less game), plus there’s an incentive to bank up the Danger to spend on stunts and special moves.</p>
