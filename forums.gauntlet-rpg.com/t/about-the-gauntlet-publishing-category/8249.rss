              <p>Hi all.<br>
I have been running a trophy gold game for some friends who are all DnD gamers originally.  The performance has been leaden at best.  My biggest issues seem to stem from players (especially those who are familiar with DnD, this is a reoccuring theme i would say) staying close together, not engaging with anything, not taking risks etc.<br>
If I tell them they see motion out in a field, there’s clearly something going on, their response is to sit around the campfire etc. and not go out to find out whats going on, despite the fact that they are hired essentially to guard a caravan.   It is very frustrating.  They had an encounter with a troll who, though dangerous, was by no means actually threatening them.  They didn’t ask one question of him.  They didn’t try to learn about him.  They basically stood around and waited for prompts.</p>
<p>Do you have any pointers on enhancing player engagement.</p>
