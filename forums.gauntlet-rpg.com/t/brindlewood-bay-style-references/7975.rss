    <title>Brindlewood Bay style references</title>

    <description>Hi! I&#39;ll be running Brindlewood Bay for a few weeks, and while I like the game and I&#39;m pretty excited about it, my biggest hurdle right now are some of the references. Like, what does `Martha&#39;s Vineyard` means? Being from México I don&#39;t have a lot of context for some of these, mainly:

&gt; All the Cardigans
Goin&#39; Fishin&#39;
Hippy Dippy
Martha&#39;s Vineyard
Speed Walkin&#39;
Up in Pumps

I can imagine them, but if you have a tv/film character to reference that would help me and my players a lot!

I had a similar problem with the Maven Moves, because I&#39;m not familiar with most of those shows, but they are character names and they are more easily googleable, so I get the gist

Thank you!</description>

              <p>And pumps are high heels, basically. I think of ‘Up in pumps’ as a bit glamorous, maybe a suggestion of wealth, well put together and stylish. But of course, all these names are as much suggestions and sensibilities as literal descriptions.</p>

              <p>Martha’s Vineyard is an island in Massachusetts where a lot of wealthy Americans spend their summers.</p>
<p>Hippy dippy is kinda outdated slang for someone involved in behaviors associated with the 60s or New Age trends.</p>
<p>Speed walking is a form of exercise that was trendy for a while with older Americans. It’s faster than walking but slower than jogging.</p>
<p>Goin’ fishin’ can mean literally that you’re going fishing, or that you just don’t plan on doing anything that could be mistaken for work.</p>
<p>Not sure about the other two.</p>
