    <description>****Apocalypse Keys: New Blood Initiative - For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you have not yet had a chance to play Apocalypse Keys****

“The End is Nigh.

This world is fragile. Many things howl at the edges of reality, many claws reach out to find a way in. There are ancient doors of power that connect this world to destiny. If harbingers of the apocalypse open enough of these doors, the world will end on their terms.

But you’re not going to let that happen, are you? You’ve come to love this world, even if it doesn’t completely accept you.”

Join me as I take a run at (and probably make a mess of) Jammi&#39;s game,  **Apocalypse Keys** , in playtest from Evil Hat Productions. You play monstrous agents of an organization called the DIVISION, tasked with protecting the world from terrifying evils while struggling with the darkness that calls out to you. The main touchstones are Hellboy comics and movies, the Penny Dreadful television series, Men in Black, and Doom Patrol.

We&#39;ll play through Darold Ross&#39; Mystery  *Weep Your Hands Clean* .

There will be 4 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.  **Note there is no session on May 9.**

Each session is 3 hours.

**NUMBER OF PLAYERS** : Three players in addition to the GM.

**SAFETY TOOLS IN USE** : X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy, Stars &amp; Wishes. The game will follow [the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

**VENUE/TECH** : Zoom Video, Google Sheets Character Keeper, Jon Grim&#39;s [rollwithme.xyz](http://rollwithme.xyz/) . Expect an email one week before the first session with the Roll20 link, and another an hour or so before each session.

**BREAKS** : Two 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.

Session will be recorded, but would only be posted with full player consent.  Currently the plan is to record only for the GM’s reference.

**PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED** : None – rules will be taught in play.
