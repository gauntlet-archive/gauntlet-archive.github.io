    <title>UnEarth + Extra Moves for World of Dungeons</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/unearth-extra-moves-for-world-of-dungeons/114</link>
    <description>UnEarth is a simple bootstrap for fantasy roleplaying based on World of Dungeons. Altogether, it&#39;s not very exciting - it&#39;s sort of a collaborative toolkit for DIY gaming. A stark and dry landscape.

_That being said, a little thirst can be welcoming in an RPG. Games that are too soggy can be a little impenetrable, after all._

It&#39;s called UnEarth for three reasons: It&#39;s unlike our Earth, you spend your time unearthing treasure from ruins, and you are also unearthing your potential. Functionally, it differs from WoDu with its advancement structure, ability methodology, and XP, each of which take cues from Dungeon World. You can find it here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YymKOnK1nCt6mrLG-O7JGFOJGRsvYtF62jGxR_0jwMk/edit?usp=sharing
**What I&#39;d most like to share, though,** are the &quot;optional rules&quot; further inspired by Dungeon World. WoDu&#39;s one-move core is simple and easy to remember, but many of the additional moves in DW are cool and helpful! These optional rules allow you to gain a measure of that utility without bogging things down too much. I&#39;ll present them here:
&gt;**Additional Moves**
&gt;* _Adventuring Gear_: Instead of noting every torch and length of rope in a character’s possession, the GM may supply a player with a number of uses of “Adventuring Gear.” Spending one of these uses allows a character to produce a timely and useful tool from their pack.
&gt;* _Discern Realities_: Instead of rolling to perceive every hidden door and lying tongue, a GM may supply a player with a number of uses of “Discern Realities.” Spending one of these uses allows a character to reveal a truth about a situation, to their advantage.
&gt;* _Spout Lore_: Instead of coming up with every trait of a bandersnatch or arcaneum, a GM may allot players a number of uses of “Spout Lore.” Spending one of these uses allows a character to reveal knowledge of a being or location; it’s always fun to ask how their character learned of this helpful tidbit.
&gt;* _Lucky Break_: A GM may award players “Lucky Breaks” to represent good fortune or divine favor. A player can spend a Lucky Break to re-roll any single die.

&gt;**Additional Attribute Value Bonuses**
Your value in each attribute may offer additional benefits:
&gt;* _Strength_: A number of uses of Adventuring Gear, replenished when feasible
&gt;* _Dexterity_: A number of Lucky Breaks, replenished at the start of a session
&gt;* _Constitution_: Additional hit dice to roll when leveling up (keep highest)
&gt;* _Intelligence_: A number of uses of Spout Lore, replenished at the start of a session
&gt;* _Wisdom_: A number of uses of Discern Realities, replenished at the start of a session
&gt;* _Charisma_: A number of hirelings at your command, replenished when feasible

What do you think of these? Could they use any tweaking? Would you like to use them in your own game of WoDu? If you do so, I&#39;d love to hear about it.</description>

<p>I haven’t playtested this at all, but I imagine that there is a challenge with coming up with an ability on the fly. I plan on making a list of examples, but the free-form nature of, say, FATE aspects is something that I have personally found challenging to work with in the past. I hoped that by putting characters in a dire situation, it might help spark creativity: “What ability or power do I really wish I had right now?” Now, you can have it!</p>

<p>I was not familiar with that game until now but I could see there being some confusion! I’ll have to brainstorm on that.</p>

A puzzle to be solved with prettiness, where possible. Again, way too busy for a puzzle like that right now, but the bait smells delicious.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m finding the economy of stat-based advantages completely fascinating! I think I’d like to play/run a game where ChaMod was # uses of “I know someone who might be able to help”</p>

              <p>UnEarth is a simple bootstrap for fantasy roleplaying based on World of Dungeons. Altogether, it’s not very exciting - it’s sort of a collaborative toolkit for DIY gaming. A stark and dry landscape.</p>
<p><em>That being said, a little thirst can be welcoming in an RPG. Games that are too soggy can be a little impenetrable, after all.</em></p>
<p>It’s called UnEarth for three reasons: It’s unlike our Earth, you spend your time unearthing treasure from ruins, and you are also unearthing your potential. Functionally, it differs from WoDu with its advancement structure, ability methodology, and XP, each of which take cues from Dungeon World. You can find it here:<br>

<p>UnEarth A game of excavation and discovery  Character Creation Attributes There are six attributes that all player characters have in common: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA)....</p>

<strong>What I’d most like to share, though,</strong> are the “optional rules” further inspired by Dungeon World. WoDu’s one-move core is simple and easy to remember, but many of the additional moves in DW are cool and helpful! These optional rules allow you to gain a measure of that utility without bogging things down too much. I’ll present them here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional Moves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Adventuring Gear</em>: Instead of noting every torch and length of rope in a character’s possession, the GM may supply a player with a number of uses of “Adventuring Gear.” Spending one of these uses allows a character to produce a timely and useful tool from their pack.</li>
<li>
<em>Discern Realities</em>: Instead of rolling to perceive every hidden door and lying tongue, a GM may supply a player with a number of uses of “Discern Realities.” Spending one of these uses allows a character to reveal a truth about a situation, to their advantage.</li>
<li>
<em>Spout Lore</em>: Instead of coming up with every trait of a bandersnatch or arcaneum, a GM may allot players a number of uses of “Spout Lore.” Spending one of these uses allows a character to reveal knowledge of a being or location; it’s always fun to ask how their character learned of this helpful tidbit.</li>
<li>
<em>Lucky Break</em>: A GM may award players “Lucky Breaks” to represent good fortune or divine favor. A player can spend a Lucky Break to re-roll any single die.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional Attribute Value Bonuses</strong><br>
Your value in each attribute may offer additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Strength</em>: A number of uses of Adventuring Gear, replenished when feasible</li>
<li>
<em>Dexterity</em>: A number of Lucky Breaks, replenished at the start of a session</li>
<li>
<em>Constitution</em>: Additional hit dice to roll when leveling up (keep highest)</li>
<li>
<em>Intelligence</em>: A number of uses of Spout Lore, replenished at the start of a session</li>
<li>
<em>Wisdom</em>: A number of uses of Discern Realities, replenished at the start of a session</li>
<li>
<em>Charisma</em>: A number of hirelings at your command, replenished when feasible</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think of these? Could they use any tweaking? Would you like to use them in your own game of WoDu? If you do so, I’d love to hear about it.</p>
