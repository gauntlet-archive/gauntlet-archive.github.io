On the road to hell there was a railway line. An express train to the infernal city of Dis, crewed by furies and carrying treasure and souls to damnation. You’re going to rob it.

You’re a motley crew with mixed motives. Gunslingers, snake-handlers, homesteader widows... Desperados all.

You all have two stats, Lover and Sinner.

Use Lover to make human connections, to act with honor, to hold onto hope, to resist opportunities for vice, and for selfless acts.

Use Sinner to do dirty deeds, to act with brutality, to lie through your teeth, to resist pleas for mercy, and for selfish acts.

Will you claim your prize from the train, or be overcome, damned, or broken by the heist?

Content notes: Likely some violence and vice as the Desperados reflect on their past sins and pursue their present schemes. Aiming for PG-13.

This one-shot game will begin at 7pm EST and last for 3 hours.

Safety tools on the table will include the X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and the Open Door Policy. For more information on the Gauntlet&#39;s safety tools, please refer to our Inclusivity Policy on the website (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html)

We will be playing over Streamyard (a video and voice tool) and this game session will be recorded and, with players&#39; permission, posted on Cloven Pine Games&#39; YouTube channel.
