    <description>New MexiCon is a small RPG convention in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We focus exclusively on indie and small press games, the kinds of things that don&#39;t receive much attention at other venues.

We just launched the kickstarter to pre-sell badges. If you&#39;re interested in these kinds of games and are in the southwest US, I hope you give it a look and consider joining us in April!

We have backing tiers for a badge, a badge and a hotel room, and just a support tier if you can&#39;t attend but want to help us out.
