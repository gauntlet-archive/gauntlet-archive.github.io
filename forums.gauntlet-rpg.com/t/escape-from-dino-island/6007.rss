    <description>ESCAPE FROM DINO ISLAND

Priority for new members: For the first 3 days (until October 27 at 7 pm EST), Please only RSVP if you have joined The Gauntlet in the last 3 months.

The all access time for this game is October 31st at 7 pm EST.

Here are 3 sessions of the fast paced and easy to learn PBTA game, Escape from Dino Island created by Sam Tung and Sam Roberts.

This is a thrilling adventure game about intrepid heroes trapped on an island overrun with creatures from a lost age—dinosaurs! Think Jurassic Park, King Kong, and Lost.

We&#39;ll use communication and consent tools including the X-Card, Lines/Veils, and the Open Door to help everyone stay comfortable as they are consumed by Dinos.

This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you plan to attend. We will use Streamyard and Roll20 to play. I will record and post the session to youtube if all players consent.

Note that we may only need two sessions to complete our story. If that happens, we will cancel the third (December 15th) session.

Session 1:  December 1st, 2020.  8 pm EST.
