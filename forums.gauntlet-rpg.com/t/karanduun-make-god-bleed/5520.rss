***General RSVP Opens 7/4***
This is for five sessions of *Karanduun: Make God Bleed* by LIQUORCANINI. Find out more here: https://tadhana.itch.io/karanduun Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. Rules will be taught. In session one we’ll discuss tone, choose the game frame, create characters, and get to playing.

***Karanduun*** is a high-flying, Filipino heroic fantasy Tabletop RPG in a setting inspired by Filipino Myth, Folklore, and Folk Catholicism. You play as young heroes who must make their legend known and become a legendary Karanduun by making God (whichever oppressive system and tyrant that is) bleed.

***&quot;BATALA IS DEAD, AND THE HOLY TRINITY HAS KILLED THEM. IN THE END OF THE UNIVERSE, WILL THEY SING OF YOU?&quot;***

Karanduun are those that are as fast as lightning, and as strong as the hurricane. Karanduun are those that, with a single command, fell entire armies and break the hearts of gods. But God is dead, and the Holy Trinity has killed Them. The Multiverse spirals into Kawalan, oblivion and entropy, due to the Hatred brought about by the forces of the Holy Trinity. Yes, there is no hope for this doomed world, but in its dying breath, the wake of the Karanduun, it might have been glorious.

Will you be remembered? Climb the Angel&#39;s Ladder and Make God Bleed.

*What is Alamatpunk?* Alamatpunk is the plight and struggle of heroes rising in power, ascending the Angel&#39;s Ladder, overthrowing oppressors, and achieving their destinies. They are *Alamat,* meaning *legend* or *folklore* in Filipino, for the heroes and the settings are inspired by Filipino legends, traditions, folklore, and mythology. They are *Punk* because they are stories focusing on fighting back against an oppressive regime and an overwhelmingly powerful outside force with nothing but you, your friends, and your ideals and beliefs to power you.

Other inspirations for *Karanduun* are *Book of the New Sun, Shin Megami Tensei, and Kill Six Billion Demons.*

Each session will run 2 1/2 to 3 hours. If you sign up and your attendance or RSVP changes, please also send me a message at edige23 at gmail. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. We will use Zoom for our sessions. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The Gauntlet Code of Conduct will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If your sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
