This is a run of [Thirsty Sword Lesbians](https://swordlesbians.com/) by [April Kit Walsh](https://twitter.com/GaySpaceshipGms) set in the world of Greek Mythology. I am no classicist, and no deeper understanding of the mythology beyond a pop culture level will be required to appreciate the game. At the time of writing, this game has a kickstarter in process and the game will be played using the early access rules provided from that campaign. The series will be 5 sessions long, though I may continue into February. The first session is scheduled for New Years Day and there is a slim chance it may be cancelled if real life plans intercede on my end, or there is insufficient availability. Sessions will be three hours in length. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (November 5th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants.

Thirsty Sword Lesbians is a game of telling queer stories of action and adventure. Our heroes will meet their rivals sword-to-sword, but battles can be won by words or lips as much as steel. They may be great heroes, demi-gods, or other denizens of myth and legend. They may be of any or no gender. But they will be fabulously queer and dangerously powerful. They may not escape their fates, but they will definitely break hearts on their way to it. Together, we will write their epic stories of Harryhausen wonder.

Content Warnings: We will be drawing on Greek Mythology as a keystone for this game, and there is certainly no end of problematic content therein. We will have a discussion on to what extent we want to engage the underlying mythology as part of our game setup. Likewise, the game does assume at least in part a dominant patriarchal power to fight against, and we will gauge how far we want to go with this - though that said I will not be plumbing the full depths of virulent Grecian misogyny. Action-adventure level violence will almost certainly be a part of the game, though not gratuitous levels of graphic violence. Romance is a key theme of the game, and engaged by the game mechanics, though again we will avoid any explicit sexual content as part of play. On a semi-related note - and as a sort of anti-content-warning - this game is explicitly queer and this particular run is welcoming of characters of any or no gender who identify as queer. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.

<p>Content Warnings: We will be drawing on Greek Mythology as a keystone for this game, and there is certainly no end of problematic content therein. We will have a discussion on to what extent we want to engage the underlying mythology as part of our game setup. Likewise, the game does assume at least in part a dominant patriarchal power to fight against, and we will gauge how far we want to go with this - though that said I will not be plumbing the full depths of virulent Grecian misogyny. Action-adventure level violence will almost certainly be a part of the game, though not gratuitous levels of graphic violence. Romance is a key theme of the game, and engaged by the game mechanics, though again we will avoid any explicit sexual content as part of play. On a semi-related note - and as a sort of anti-content-warning - this game is explicitly queer and this particular run is welcoming of characters of any or no gender who identify as queer. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience.
