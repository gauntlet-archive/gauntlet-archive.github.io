This session is scheduled for a maximum of 3 hours and will be recorded to share if all players consent. General RSVPs begin on May 23, 2019 at 12:00 Noon EDT. 

This is a short one-shot freeform game about a talk radio show at the end of the world. Players collaboratively create a cataclysm during the course of play, and the conventions of radio are gradually abandoned in favor of moments of genuine human connection. This game is inspired by spontaneous moments of transcendent radio. 

[Long Time Listener, Last Time Caller can be found on DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/236713/Long-Time-Listener-Last-Time-Caller)

[Safety tools in use for this game](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/tools-of-the-table.html) will include the Open Door and the X-Card, and a content discussion establishing Lines and Veils will be held prior to recording.
