    <title>One Supposes Introductions Must be in Order</title>

    <description>My name is Victor, I am a fortyish writer and game designer from Wyoming. I&#39;m a member on several RPG forums, but this one stood out to me because of its focus on both indie games and OSR games-- matching my own (main) gaming tastes and calming some of my frustrations about these games becoming opposing camps and even political shibboleths.

I got started with AD&amp;D (1e) in 1993 and switched over to 2e and *Player&#39;s Option* in 1997 and 3.0 and 3.5 at launch... in addition to branching out into numerous other games. I&#39;ve got a general &quot;I&#39;m With D&amp;D&quot; attitude, and my other favorite games are *Street Fighter: the Storytelling Game*, *Barbarians of Lemuria*, *Marvel Heroic Roleplaying*, and *Dresden Files RPG*.

My current *official* Works in Progress are *Shroompunk*, an OSR game that reimagines D&amp;D if Appendix N had been all NES and Filmation, and *Cascade City*, an urban fantasy game that replaces all of the traditional Gothic Horror guts of urban fantasy with *wuxia* and *xianxia* guts and planetary romance guts and cyberpunk guts and so many guts, more guts than your body has room for.

Unofficially I&#39;ve been trying to &quot;fix&quot; 3.PF multiclassing for fifteen years and I&#39;m not going to stop until I succeed-- and there are are a few other parts of the system I want to poke at while I&#39;m in there. Probably going to try to run a *Spelljammer* game with it, if I ever get it presentable.

*I submit myself to the judgment of the Gauntlet.*</description>
