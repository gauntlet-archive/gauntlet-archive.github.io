    <title>PbtA stat line arrays or free assignment?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/pbta-stat-line-arrays-or-free-assignment/1371</link>
    <description>So Apocalypse World, of course, uses stat line arrays where you choose one of a number of pre-set stat lines. This works well, in my opinion, because the conceptual design of the playbooks is so strong. This manifests not only with regards to the different playbooks’ main stat (the Brainer is always weird) but with regards to their secondary stats as well (X is always at least a bit Y / X is never Y).
On the other hand, many other PbtA games have free stat assignment, offering players more room to customize playbooks and playing them in different ways, leaning into different strengths or weaknesses.
Of course, different games will have different requirements, but do you have a personal preference? And what are the angles that I might be missing in how this choice affects a design?</description>

              <p>And then there is the game <em>Liberte</em> (there should be an accent over the e, but this keyboard doesn’t support that) that has <em>no</em> stats, but uses Black Bile (aka Melancholy) as a currency players spend to improve their changes to succeed, although if they roll too well, then the consequences of success come home to roost as well.  Black bile is ‘earned’ when the character is humiliated, shunned, etc. (varies by playbook), which drives character interactions in an intense and interesting way, since you want to have at least some Black Bile handy.</p>

              <p>My approach in Last Fleet is similar to Bluebeard’s Bride, I guess. Each playbook has a fixed stat at +2, a fixed stat at -1, and then the remaining three are assigned freely at either +0/+0/+1 or -1/+1/+1. So you preserve the focused experience, with no risk of accidentally b0rking the playbook, but with some choice.</p>
<p>Honestly as a player I couldn’t care less whether I get a choice or not. I like choosing moves, because they’re interesting. Stats are kind of boring, so if the designer wants to limit my choices I’m fine with that. If they want me to choose, fine, I can manage that.</p>

              <p>Another voice in favour of stat line arrays here (especially with the +1 option).</p>
<p>The real strength of PBTA games is that you can laser focus the design on a specific experience.  You can have a set of Basic Moves and Skin moves which very precisely emulate a genre.  I think that stat line arrays feed into that.</p>
<p>As a player I don’t want to be worrying that I’ll pick the ‘wrong’ stats for my character and my moves.  The limitation of skin moves already means that my character is channelled in a particular direction - I want a steer on the stats that support that direction.</p>

So the playbook has a built-in speciality, but the rest is a simple binary choice. This only works with a small array of stats, but it does make character generation sleek so you can get onto the suspense.</p>

I think it’s an intresting middle ground between assigning stats any which way and giving set stat lines. Similar to Night Witches, not all playbooks have even stat distribution which allows for playbooks like The Jobber (a wrestler whose purpose is to lose to other wrestlers) to hit their tone more consistently.</p>

              <p>Stats are really the least interesting part about customizing your playbook. <em>Dungeon World</em> needs the versatility, others are better served with making it a quick and easy choice.</p>
<p>Stats in PbtA are not even that descriptive… they really just tell you what a character is more likely to get their way with or not.</p>
<p>That is really brought home by <em>The Veil</em>. If you got Mad +2 this does not mean you are an angry person. It just means that when acting out of anger you are much more likely to get what you set out to do.<br>
In fact, a choleric character is likely one that has a bad Mad Stat but just uses it very often.</p>
<p>Your <em>Apocalypse World</em> character can still be sexy as hell with a low Hot, I feel. It’s just it gets you into more trouble than it gets you out of.</p>
<p>(Btw, in <em>Dungeon World</em> (with the weird Stat/Modifier confusion), you increase a Stat every level, leading to Modifier increases.)</p>

              <p>I don’t mind which get used. For games like Dungeon World the openness of the stats works well. For games with less stats or a much more intense focus (e.g. Monsterhearts), having one or two arrays to pick from is great. MH2’s descriptions also mentioning what kind of Skin you might want to experience with each array is a nice touch.</p>

              <p>Dungeon World - arrange all 6 stats as desired, but no option to increase stats after char gen.<br>
Monster of the Week - choose an array, but you can raise any stat after char gen.</p>
<p>So DW lets you start more competent, but MOTW gives you room to grow.</p>
<p>Most players like some amount of choice. Personally I like games with open choice for post char gen, so direction and breadth is up to you.</p>

              <p>So Apocalypse World, of course, uses stat line arrays where you choose one of a number of pre-set stat lines. This works well, in my opinion, because the conceptual design of the playbooks is so strong. This manifests not only with regards to the different playbooks’ main stat (the Brainer is always weird) but with regards to their secondary stats as well (X is always at least a bit Y / X is never Y).<br>
On the other hand, many other PbtA games have free stat assignment, offering players more room to customize playbooks and playing them in different ways, leaning into different strengths or weaknesses.<br>
Of course, different games will have different requirements, but do you have a personal preference? And what are the angles that I might be missing in how this choice affects a design?</p>
