    <title>The Ten Minute Scene</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/the-ten-minute-scene/1926</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on a game that is structured into ten minute scenes. We playtested last Saturday and I was struck by the powerful effect that this constraint had on play - ten minutes is not much time, so it focuses play wonderfully. In my case each scene has some specific prompts for things that must occur within it, and the harsh time limit meant that players immediately engaged with the scene&#39;s core concern.

My game is a freeform larp, so diegetic time and actual time are pretty much 1:1, and setting a timer seems like it would be less effective for tabletop, where there are more variables in how player time has to be spent. But as a designable surface, time and its limitation seems really fruitful. 

I&#39;m reminded of the improv exercise where you play a scene, then play it again in half the time, and then half again, until it is just a frenzied gesture. 

Let&#39;s talk about existing tabletop and live action games that incorporate time as a tool in their design, or games that could make use of this.</description>

              <p>In <em>A Cool and Lonely Courage</em> I recommend 10 minutes or less per scene. There isn’t a timer or hard rule about it, but because we normally focus on the key conversation that arises from a scene, that length seems about right</p>

              <p>I have run my first playtest for <em>Last Words</em>, a laog with scenes going for exactly 5 minutes each. Here is a recording if you are curious how that goes:</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="Zi7FGdZ_7JE" data-youtube-title="Last Words Playtest" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>I very much enjoyed the sharp endings. However, the situation surely is a bit different in the game: one player is in total isolation for the whole game: they can talk to one other player but can’t hear anybody. Instead, they communicate with the third player through a Google Drawing. One player can hear the others but plays with closed eyes or in darkness. So 5 minutes can feel very different (longer) under these circumstances.</p>

              <p>For that very reason, <em>Our Mundane Supernatural Life</em> was my game of the year 2018. The experience is enhanced by mapping out the scenes of the game in advance. The <em>downtime</em> between scenes is limited because of that. I used that in <em>The Election of the Wine Queen</em>, too: play is structured in three acts, each act has four to six scenes which are pre-planned by the players. Then you can go through them without interruption.</p>

              <p>I use soundtracks with informational cues in larp sometimes. My game <em>Perfection</em> has 90 minutes of uninterrupted play, and a soundtrack that tells you when 30 and 60 minutes have passed. I have another (unpublished) game called <em>The Wonderful Year</em> where someone is infected with the plague every time you hear church bells in the diegetic soundtrack.</p>
<p>This feels like it would work less well for tabletop, because there’s usually a layer of procedural friction with things like die handling or negotiation or scene setup, but I guess you can play freeform tabletop as well.</p>

When a character acted in their areas of expertise, their player could start the time on their stopwatch, and while the stopwatch was running they had total narrative control.

<p>We actually played the same scene three times and were told to play with different levels of intensity, but I’m not sure we did that. But the scenes were maybe 90 seconds long, which meant the conversation didn’t get very far.</p>
<p>The first time we played the scene I approached it using a strategy of working up to asking the other person for something slowly. The second time I let him take a little bit more of the lead. But in neither case did we get to anything of substance.</p>
<p>The third time I played the same scene I just started by laying out an ultimatum for the other player, since I already knew what they were after, and just wanted to play a scene that would actually be interesting, and provide a fun experience for the actor playing opposite of me.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this was a result of the short time, playing the same scene 3x, or both.</p>

              <p>So AFAIK there’s no RPG that actually does this, but there’s board game where you play a music track and the timing of the music tells you when stuff happens mechanically. That would be super-cool in roleplaying, like if you had a track long enough for a session.</p>

              <p>Kiss her Before the World Ends uses timed scenes.  I haven’t played it yet but I’m really keen to do so and the scenes are super short.  First round scenes are 4 mins, second round are 5 mins, third round is 3 mins and I think some of the downtime resolution between scenes is also time limited.</p>

              <p>Sarabande is a Nordic LARP that does really cool stuff with music and time and repeating rhythms. You play Parisian artists in the Montmartre and one of the few rules is that, as artists, you can only express yourself through art. No dialogue, but you can monologue, song, dance, paint, recite free form poetry, mime, etc. each scene is framed with about a two minute piece of music to establish that every day is much like every other day, followed by ten minutes covering the events of that day, repeating for about two hours.</p>
<p>Had a stunning experience with it with about a dozen strangers a couple years ago, almost all of whom I greet with hugs every time I’ve seen them since</p>

              <p><em><strong>Puppetland</strong></em> has the rule “All stories take an hour, but an hour is not always an hour.” I don’t have any experience how that works out in play, though.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>One of the best campaigns (a <em><strong>Nobilis</strong></em> game) I played in had a timer for scenes. Every scene lasted 5 minutes (I think. Maybe more or less). At the end of 5 minutes, you could request an additional 5 minutes. This meant that we could split our large party of characters, but no one was sidelined for too long. And it meant the action was more focused, rather than flabby and meandering. There were other factors that made the game great, of course, but when we played that game or other games without the timer it was less good.</p>

              <p>The Storybrewers’ <a href="https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/freegames/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Our Mundane Supernatural Life</em></a> uses a random timer (2-5 minutes) for each of its twelve scenes, and I’ve found that it helps achieve the game’s goals of being a slice of life simulator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play through the scene. The scene may not end until the timer runs out—and when the timer ends, it must end immediately.<br>
If the drama finishes too early, that’s fine. Show us the trivial, mundane and everyday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The characters have individual and shared conflicts, and in the couple of games I’ve played of it, these timers (and the way the day is broken up) helped us keep the characters and setting up-front, with the conflicts taking a back seat.</p>

              <p>I’m working on a game that is structured into ten minute scenes. We playtested last Saturday and I was struck by the powerful effect that this constraint had on play - ten minutes is not much time, so it focuses play wonderfully. In my case each scene has some specific prompts for things that must occur within it, and the harsh time limit meant that players immediately engaged with the scene’s core concern.</p>
<p>My game is a freeform larp, so diegetic time and actual time are pretty much 1:1, and setting a timer seems like it would be less effective for tabletop, where there are more variables in how player time has to be spent. But as a designable surface, time and its limitation seems really fruitful.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of the improv exercise where you play a scene, then play it again in half the time, and then half again, until it is just a frenzied gesture.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about existing tabletop and live action games that incorporate time as a tool in their design, or games that could make use of this.</p>
