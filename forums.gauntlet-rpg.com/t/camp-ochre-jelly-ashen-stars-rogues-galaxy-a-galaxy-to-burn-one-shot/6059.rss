**This is a practice game for Camp Ochre Jelly.**

Times are hard for a crew of criminals in today&#39;s galaxy. The Bleed is on the brink of war: The Combine has been building up its naval fleet to bring that anarchic area under its heel once and for all, while the Rebels are making a propaganda push for hearts and minds. All this has caused business in the underworlds to dry up. But maybe there&#39;s a way to turn this saber-rattling in your favor?

**Ashen Stars: Rogues&#39; Galaxy**  is an investigative game where you play a crew of criminals in deep space, discovering dirty secrets and unraveling mysteries. It is set in the far future, in a wide outer area of the galaxy called the Bleed, imperfectly patrolled by a multi-civilization cartel called the Combine.

**CW: Violence, violence against law enforcement, profanity, revolution, poverty, crime.**

**System** : Ashen Stars by Robin D. Laws and published by Pelgrane Press (GUMSHOE Engine, Warp Play rules, Rogues&#39; Galaxy hack)

**Duration** : One 4 hour session

**Breaks** : 3 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue** : GM&#39;s Zoom

**Recording** : Yes, with permission before and after

**Attendance** : Open door policy

**Safety** : [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools (Lines, Veils, Script Change and X-Card) will be in use.
