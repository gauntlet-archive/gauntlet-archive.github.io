Japan. The year is 1889. After months of deliberation, a Constitution is about to be approved, giving absolute power to Emperor Meiji. In the last two decades, there have been profound political and social reforms that have cleared the way for “modernization:” the abolition of feudal privileges, the establishment of European-style political, police, and judicial systems, restructuring of the army, etc. But not everyone is happy with these changes.
In these convulsive years, *yokai* sightings and encounters have increased tremendously. Some blame the barbarians, others accuse nostalgics of the *bakufu* times, and a few even dare to hold His Majesty responsible. The truth is nobody knows the reason behind the uptick in sightings for sure.
As a member of the Yokai Hunters Society, you took an oath to help cleanse the world of these abominations known as *yokai.* Hunters work discreetly and never abandon their obligations. They live seemingly normal lives and their daily routines until they receive a splint with engraved spirals—then the hunt begins.

These are four sessions of [*Yokai Hunters Society*](https://punkpadour.itch.io/yokai-hunter) by Chema González. Being able to attend every session is ideal, but not required. You must sign up for each session you wish to attend.
We’ll use [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/) (you shouldn’t need to download the application if you don’t want) and [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/). I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary information and links.

**Content Warnings:** light psychological horror, bodily harm, an air of (historical) xenophobia and/or nativism, human-like creatures as a horror element
**Safety Tools:** We will use [Script Change](http://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/) and [Lines and Veils](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/30906/what-do-the-terms-lines-and-veils-mean#30913) during our sessions. We will adhere to the [Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

              <p>Hey! <a class="mention" href="/u/chema">@chema</a>, we unfortunately only got a single session played and, doubly unfortunately for both you and <a class="mention" href="/u/kwarnberg">@kwarnberg</a>, I…completely forgot to record them <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/no_mouth.png?v=9" title=":no_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":no_mouth:"> I can say, though, the game ran smoothly and, despite my hemming and hawing about the “difficulty” of the system, the players readily exploited their equipment, experience(s) and the setting to get their advantages and modifiers. All that to say that I think we all “got” the system better than expected and it made pushing for those creative solutions feel very natural.</p>
<p>That first session felt pretty quick, but we did character creation as well. The tables worked really well to produce different and immediately interesting PCs that the players really ran with.<br>
I ran the players through a pretty simple yokai case to get a feel for the playing the game and it produced quite a nice, little story — the Yokai, the spirit of a mother whose child was lost, was kidnapping children from a poorer part of Tokyo. The were able to find the yokai since it always brought hyper-localized rain where ever it was and the PCs soon found how <em>weird</em> it — the ground was soaked and muddy, but none of the structures nor they themselves were wet (it had a feeling mineral oil rather than water). Despite a burn on one character’s arm, they were able to deduce the problem with some interaction and then put the yokai to rest by holding a small, makeshift funeral for the yokai’s long-dead child.<br>
Aside from all of that, there was some intrigue with the rich wife of an American naval officer possibly becoming one of the PC’s (who was a painter) patron…</p>
