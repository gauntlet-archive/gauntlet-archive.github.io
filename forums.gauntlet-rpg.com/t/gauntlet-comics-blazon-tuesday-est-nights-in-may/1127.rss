You were just a person. Maybe a great one, maybe just one with potential. Then an alien being came down from the skies and told you that the universe needed protectors. That there are only so many who are up to the job. That you&#39;re one of them. That alien being gave you a badge.

The badge -- the Blazon -- gives you incredible powers. Almost effortlessly, it lets you do what you did before at the peak of human ability. With an act of will, it can harness the heart of a star and make those feats supernatural. And at a greater cost, a personal cost, it lets you gird yourself in armor of starshine and fly through space, going toe-to-toe with battlecruisers.

But there are others out there. Those who wield their powers not in the service of Law but of Chaos. Those whose badges harness singularities that sing with a hunger for souls. Those who make their homes on moons made of cancer and who glow not with starshine but with a sickly rainbow of colors that should not be.

And then there&#39;s the seduction of the Balance. The urge to show mercy or give vengeance rather than do justice. And who&#39;s to say where that line lies?

-------

In the RPG Blazon, PCs are people with the extraordinary potential to serve Law or Chaos. They’re drafted into a cosmic conflict over the fate of the Balance. They are called upon to give justice and render judgment.

They’re empowered by non-sentient badges that let them summon great cosmic power. We’re talking energy constructs and space combat, of course!
