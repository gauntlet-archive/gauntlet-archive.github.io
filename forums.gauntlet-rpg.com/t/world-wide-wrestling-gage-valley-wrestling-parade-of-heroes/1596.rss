So, April 23rd is my 40th Birthday and while i&#39;m not doing much to celebrate on the day I would invite folk to join me in the evening to play a game of World Wide Wrestling.

This game is inspired by the real life event &quot;Collision in Korea&quot; which you can find out more about with the links on the event page.

The event will start at 8pm and run for 3 hours.
