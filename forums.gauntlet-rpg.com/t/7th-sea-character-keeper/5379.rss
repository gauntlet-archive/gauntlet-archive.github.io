    <description>Does anyone know if there&#39;s a 7th Sea character Keeper?  Ideally for 1e, but 2e will suffice.  Wanting to try some things out with that game.</description>

              <p>Hi! A character keeper is a sheet for people to keep their character information on, so it’s all accessible from one place like a Google Drive or Dropbox folder. I did see the Gauntlet’s Drive folder of resources did have a 7th Sea one. I think it might even have been first edition.</p>
