    <description>I&#39;m working on a Sci Fi hack of TG and I&#39;m currently designing the ship combat rules. I wanted something pretty light that would still engage all the players. I&#39;d love some feedback and ideas about what I have so far. 

Tech Skills – one per Job (option for more in Char Gen), link to ship combat and systems (as listed below by action type)

**Ship**  – works like a hero, can take six conditions (each with specific downsides)

* Scratches and Dents – no effect
* Engines take a hit! – (-1D to Pilot Rolls)
* Targeting System Malfunction (-1D to Attack rolls)
* Drive System Damaged (-1D to Engineering Rolls)
* Ship’s Systems Damage (-1D to all Ship Rolls)
* Dead in the Water (no movement or weapons)
* Start a clock for atmo loss (or impose another appropriate consequence)

Stock Ships have a single weapon and a single point of armor (use as in normal combat)

* Additional armor, weapons, and Supply boxes can all be added as projects in the Station phase
* Armor costs 1 Cred to repair in the Station phase

**Each PC can take one action per ship combat turn, Fire a Weapon, Fly the Ship, Repair the ship, Engineering, Comms, or help another crew member.**
At the beginning of a round of combat each crew decides which actions to take and what order they will occur in. Ship Dice to not carry over from turn to turn - use &#39;em or lose &#39;em.

**Fly the Ship**  – rolls 1 die, (2 w. Pilot) 4-5’s = 1  *Maneuver Die* , 6 = 2 MD

Each MD can do one of the following:

* Bring to Bear – add one die to the combat pool
* Evasive Maneuvers – roll Xd 4+ prevents a Condition
* Flee – each 4+ ticks one segment on the Fly Away! Clock. Escape when filled

**Engineering**  – rolls 1 die (2 with Engineering) 4-5 = 1  *Engineering Die* , 6 = 2 ED

ED may be spent to:

* Power to the Guns – add 1 die to combat
* Overclock the Engine – +1D to Pilot rolls
* Divert Power to Ship Systems - +1D to Repair Rolls

**Repair**  – rolls1 die (2 w Mechanic) 4-5 = 1  *Repair Die* , 6 = 2 RD

RD may be spent to:

* The right tool - Add +1D to a Risk Roll to Repair a Damage Condition
* Get that clamped Down! – Make a Repair Roll
* Ship Supplies can be ticked to add +1D to a repair Roll

**Fire a Weapon**  – make an attack roll against the enemies Endurance

Roll 1D (+1 for Heavy) add 1 Dark D if you’re willing to risk damage

* If the highest 2 dice beat enemies E then either destroyed or crippled, your choice
* if the enemy isn’t destroyed you can roll any 6’s from the combat roll to reduce the enemy ship’s E

**Comms**  – allows for communication and negotiation, roll an appropriate skill to barter, plead or command</description>

              <p>Well, I’m in the playtest phase of design now, so once I’ve had a chance to stress test it you’ll get exactly that. I need to adjust some other design bits and systems to fit it in properly too.</p>
