    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/02/16/crowdfunding-zine-collection-160/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Zine Collection #160, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/07 and 02/15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This time around there are 153 ZineQuest projects, 84 of those a tabletop roleplaying games and gamebooks. There are 48 „normal“ projects as well (I put those in another article).

These are way to many games, to give each one a shout-out. Thus I’ll be sticking to those, which I backed or marked for later considerations.
Thus I will start with &lt;b&gt;Tension&lt;/b&gt;. It focuses on the tensions between a detective and a criminal, not unlike shows like „Hannibal“. As I am a fan of the series, I decided to back the project. The game &lt;b&gt;Denial &amp; Yearning: A Trashy Lesbian Romance Novel Game&lt;/b&gt; offers quite exactly what the titles describes. An additional note I would add, is that it is one of the „two player“ roleplaying games, that you’ll be playing with one other person. I backed &lt;b&gt;Once Upon a Time in New Centauri&lt;/b&gt;, based on its optics and theme, yet the project surprisingly ended between publishing my German edition, and this one. Thus, it only gets an honorably mention. The sourcematerial &lt;b&gt;The Journal of Fantastic Linguistics&lt;/b&gt; offers a look at crypto linguistic (how „made up“ languages work). I am quite fascinated by languages in general, and thus jumped in.
Then there is &lt;b&gt;Natalia’s Guide to Necromancy&lt;/b&gt;, that introduces more necromancy and vampires into D&amp;D 5E. The &lt;b&gt;Vampire Cruise&lt;/b&gt; OSR adventure, sport my favorite creature as well, alas, only as antagonists. These, and many, many more projects, you’ll find in this article.

&lt;b&gt;English Crowdfundings&lt;/b&gt;
