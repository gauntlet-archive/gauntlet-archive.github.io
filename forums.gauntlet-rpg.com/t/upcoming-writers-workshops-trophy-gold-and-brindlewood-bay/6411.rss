    <description>Gauntlet Publishing will be hosting two more writer&#39;s workshops in the coming months, Brindlewood Bay Writer&#39;s Workshop 3 and Trophy Gold Writer&#39;s Workshop 1. More details for each are below...

**Brindlewood Bay Writer&#39;s Workshop 3**
Brindlewood Bay Writer’s Workshop 3 will be held on February 28th from 1PM - 4PM Eastern. We’ll be meeting via Zoom. The focus of this edition of the workshop will be “Advanced Mystery Writing and Campaign Structure.” In order to participate, you must have a complete draft of a mystery or campaign structure for your Carved from Brindlewood game (or a complete draft of a mystery for Brindlewood Bay itself). 

This workshop will be structured like an open discussion. I (Jason) will read and circulate your draft beforehand so long as you send it to me by February 20th. Drafts will only be circulated to other participants of the workshop. 

If you’re interested in participating in the workshop, please send an email to jason.cordova@hey.com, subject line: “Brindlewood Bay Workshop 3.” In your email, please include a short description of the game you are working on. You can use the same email to send me a draft of your mystery/campaign structure when you’re ready to circulate it among participants. 

**Trophy Gold Writer&#39;s Workshop 1**
Trophy Gold Writer’s Workshop 1 will be held on March 7th from 1PM - 4PM Eastern. The focus of this workshop will be writing incursions for Trophy Gold. In order to participate, you must have a complete or in-progress draft of a Trophy Gold incursion. Trophy author Jesse Ross and frequent Trophy contributor Gabriel Robinson will both be in attendance. 

This workshop will be structured like an open discussion. I (Jason) will circulate your draft beforehand so long as you send it to me by March 1st. Drafts will only be circulated to other participants of the workshop. If your draft isn’t ready by March 1st, you can still participate in the workshop, but you should have some questions you’d like to discuss prepared for the group.

If you’re interested in participating in the workshop, please send an email to jason.cordova@hey.com, subject line: “Trophy Gold Workshop 1.” In your email, please include a short description of the incursion you are working on. You can use the same email to send me a draft of your incursion when you’re ready to circulate it among participants.</description>

              <p>The workshop will be recorded, so you’ll be able to watch it even if you can’t attend.</p>
<p>There isn’t an SRD, but you’re welcome to rework any of the rules you wish for your own hack, and you can quote my text, as needed. The only thing I reserve the right to is the color and setting.</p>
<p>The hacks are just now starting to get underway. If you join the Gauntlet Publishing Discord, you can read about many of them and follow their development. <a href="https://discord.gg/qM9frCpvYG" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discord.gg/qM9frCpvYG</a></p>

              <p>I wish I could attend the Brindlewood Bay workshop. Unfortunately it will be at 3am my time. Is there a current SRD for the system for reference? What other Brindlewood Bay adaptions would you recommend I play and feel out in preparation for a first draft?</p>
