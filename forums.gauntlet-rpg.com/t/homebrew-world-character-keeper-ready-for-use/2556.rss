    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/homebrew-world-character-keeper-ready-for-use/2556</link>
    <description>After some help getting started from @Michael_G_Barford, I&#39;ve finished a (fancy schmancy) character keeper for [Homebrew World](https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2018/07/homebrew-world.html), my drift of Dungeon World (a sort of DW2.0 streamlined for one-shots and mini-series style play). 

https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2019/07/online-version-of-homebrew-world.html

It&#39;s actually all of HBW converted into Google Sheets format, including the GM stuff, basic moves, etc. 

I&#39;d be all sorts of interested in feedback, either from folks just poking around at the sheets or using them for actual online play.  

Specific questions:
* Are the character sheets on the **PCs** tab actually useful in play?
* Do you find yourself wanting to (or just accidentally) needing to edit content? Copy/paste stuff?  Otherwise break the spreadsheet? :)  If so, what and why?

Thanks!</description>

<p>It should be open to anyone.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m noticing:</p>
<p>It seems to work correctly for most character types/playbooks (I haven’t tried them all!). However, for the Wielder (which was the first one I tried), I get the message with any field I try to select or modify.</p>
<p>EDIT: Check out the Druid’s Drive. I chose one, but it’s unhappy for some reason. This doesn’t seem to happen with other playbooks!</p>
<p>I hope this is more helpful than frustrating!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the “Heads up! You’re trying to edit part of this sheet…” warning is unavailable. It appears to happen there are any protected-with-warning cells in the group being collapsed. (Well, not <em>any</em>… it’s kind of inconsistent. But I couldn’t make it go away and keep the warning messages for accidental edits.)</p>
<p>The “inserted row” behavior was a bit of an illusion, i think. I had an extra empty column between each playbook, so when you collapsed the playbook, it ended up with two empty columns instead of one.  I just cleared out the extra column.  You still end up with a stray column for each playbook, but it’s not as bad.</p>

<p>Here’s a novice-to-apprentice-user-level bug (or PEBKAC), presented in the classic reporting pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Steps to repeat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow link to the Google Sheet.</li>
<li>Use “File &gt; Make a copy” of the Google Sheet.</li>
<li>Select the “PCs” tab.</li>
<li>Click the respective [-] icon above any of the texts reading “If unused, click the [-] icon above the column headers to collapse.”</li>

<p><strong>Expected experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The column of content below the indicator “collapses” or disappears in some way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actual experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A modal box appears with the mesage " Heads up! You’re trying to edit part of this sheet that shouldn’t be changed accidentally. Edit anyway?"</li>
<li>Clicking OK produces creates a new spreadsheet column to appear to the left of the column with the [-] icon.  (i.e. as if the command “Insert &gt; Column left” had been selected.</li>

<p>Weird. It looks off for when I first load it, but then quickly corrects.  I added a little more buffer space. Maybe that will help.</p>
<p>Oh! Also, I was missing an entry on the left hand box.  Fixed.</p>

<p>Good point. It’s tough, cuz I don’t want to add <em>more</em> vertical scrolling the whole thing.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Two reasons for the vertical orientation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having 10 tabs to sift through seems overwhelming and bad</li>
<li>From my experience playing with folks on the Gauntlet, people <em>really</em> like having the ability to see everyone’s character sheets all in one place. And I generally agree. Being able to see your sheet while you’re playing gives me time to think about ways I can riff on your Drive or our relationships or your moves.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve thought about trying to make something that gives you, like, 1 tab for each player, with a “HUD” section displaying abbreviated contents of everyone else’s playbook.  But I’m not sure that’s even possible, much less feasible.</p>
<p>Small font size is definitely a sacrifice to the constraints of space.  I expect folks might have to zoom in a bit.</p>

</aside>
<p><em>Someone</em> rolls damage for monsters in DW/HBW.  Standard rule is that the player rolls the damage that they take, but plenty of folks drift that to the GM rolling damage. Either way: 'vantage here works the same as elsewhere… roll an extra die, discard the lowest or highest.</p>

              <p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>This looks great! I flipped and read through it, but didn’t actually use it in play, so take that into consideration.</p>
<p>Stream of consciousness thoughts:</p>
<p>Most of it works really, really well. I was thrown by the Shield having two checkboxes for a moment (you can’t check the second one), but that makes sense. Having clickable checkboxes is far easier than writing and erasing, too (for example, for Experience)!</p>
<p>Being able to choose between Backgrounds and having those populate the fields below works really well. This kind of touch makes using this really quick and really space-efficient, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>Under “GM Stuff”, the “Damage” box is too small, and doesn’t line up quite right with the one beside it.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet is nicely set up so that it’s not <em>tempting</em> to do anything game-breaking, but some more space for notes could be useful, perhaps (not just at the bottom, but in other spaces, too). I’d have to try it in actual play to see! Having the character sheets that <em>vertical</em> could be awkward (as opposed to having them as rows or as separate tabs), or it might be just great; I’m not sure.</p>
<p>(I’m sure people will find ways to ruin the spreadsheet, but they should be able not to!)</p>
<p>I have no idea what +advantage or -disadvantage does for monsters. They don’t roll, do they?</p>
<p>Some of the font size (especially the reference material) is really small, but I suppose someone with poor eyesight might have some Zoom settings engaged on their browser or Google Sheets settings already.</p>
<p>Excellent work! I would definitely use this. Lots of nice little touches, like how the Debilities, when selected, highlight the relevant stats.</p>

<h3><a href="https://spoutinglore.blogspot.com/2019/07/online-version-of-homebrew-world.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Online Version of Homebrew World</a></h3>

<p>I just finished creating an online character keeper for Homebrew World . Check it out!     Current online version    You'll need to save you...</p>

<p>It’s actually all of HBW converted into Google Sheets format, including the GM stuff, basic moves, etc.</p>
<p>I’d be all sorts of interested in feedback, either from folks just poking around at the sheets or using them for actual online play.</p>
<p>Specific questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the character sheets on the <strong>PCs</strong> tab actually useful in play?</li>
<li>Do you find yourself wanting to (or just accidentally) needing to edit content? Copy/paste stuff?  Otherwise break the spreadsheet? <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  If so, what and why?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>
