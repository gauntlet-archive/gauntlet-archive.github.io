    <title>Night Witches: 1943</title>

    <description>&quot;There was a night bomber regiment in World War Two composed entirely of women. Natural-born Soviet airwomen.These 200 women and girls, flying outdated biplanes from open fields near the front lines, attacked the invading German forces every night for 1,100 consecutive nights. When they ran out of bombs they dropped railroad ties.&quot;

This is the fifth monthly series in a run of Night Witches that will span a number of months and eventually encompass the entire Great Patriotic War. We will likely be flying over the frigid waters of PERESYP&#39;: Driving the Fascist beasts off the Taman Peninsula requires a new kind of flying—often above the Sea of Azov and Black Sea, over water at night. Without landmarks this requires dead reckoning with the careful coordination of airspeed, heading and time. Extremely technical flying in foul weather, combined with stiffening German resistance, makes for very stressful nights in the cockpit.

This series is comprised of 4 sessions. You must volunteer for each individually. It&#39;s best if you can volunteer for all of them, but not required. If you played in any previous series, you may carry over your pilot or create a new one.  

CONTENT WARNING: This is a game about war, and explicitly a game about the price women pay to wage it. Violence and death, including the death of player characters, are an inescapable aspect of this game. We will use the X-Card and Script Change to assure as safe a play space as possible, as well as Open Door Policy. Sessions will be recorded for reference, but only released for public consumption if all players consent.

Tuesday nights at 8:00 PM Eastern US time the last 4 weeks of October (no games October 1 because it&#39;s my birthday!)
