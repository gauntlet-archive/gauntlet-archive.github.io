![1599px-1867_Edward_Poynter_-_Israel_in_Egypt|690x289](upload://isrYNEkpt8kZHOS9h2tkDzNVulf.jpeg)*Looking for 2-5 players who want to put their own twist on an old tale!*

**What is this game?**

*Ma Nishtana: Why is this Night Different? (PLAYTEST)*  is a GMless, narrative RPG where players tell their own rendition of the Jewish exodus from Egypt ☀️, exploring relationships between the characters and making their own choices to deliver the Hebrew people out of peril. This is a story for Jews, non-Jews, and the Jew-“ish”. All are welcome around the table. ✌️

**Setting Expectations** 

This game distorts the Exodus story. It also reorganizes and excludes certain conventional components of the Seder. As such this experience may be challenging for some. &quot;Lines and veils&quot;, the &quot;x-card&quot;, and an open door policy will be safety tools encouraged to use in this game. We will take a break every hour.

**How to Play**

Ma Nishtana is played in a series of scenes, called “Rituals”. At the start of the game everyone selects a character. A designated Ritual Guide (RG) sets the scene and guides a discussion about how it should be staged. All players collaborate to establish the story’s details. There are no dice.

**What should I prepare?**

*Something to drink*

*Something you do not particularly like, but are willing to eat*

*Something dirty and something to clean it with*

*Something that is old or has been in your life for a long time*

*Something you can break or rip*

***Content Warnings:***
Oppression, violence, religious discrimination. This game distorts and takes liberties with the conventional Passover narrative.

***When is the Playtest?***
[date=2020-12-16 time=10:00:00 timezone=&quot;Asia/Tokyo&quot;]

***When does a general sign up open?***

***What else should I know?***
