    <title>I Have The High Ground</title>

    <description>I Have The High Ground is a collaborative two-player duelling game of banter, posturing and capes by Jess Levine. The game is not an action-packed fight to the death—though that might occur in the battle which follows your duel—but rather a portrayal of the smoldering tension between two individuals about to risk their pride, their reputation, or 
even their lives. 

No rules knowledge is required and all rules will be taught during play. 

Subject matter in the game includes violence and the threat of violence, and potentially flirtatious banter. We’ll use safety tools including lines and veils, the X card and the open door. The game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

I’ve scheduled 3 hours to make sure we have enough time, but I expect we’ll finish closer to 2 hours. We’ll play over Streamyard with short breaks on the hour. I won’t record the session. 

I’ll email a week before the session to confirm attendance and share play materials. 

Open access time for sign ups is 1pm 23rd August AEST.
