    <description>PIPEDREAM​ is a #SWORDDREAM roleplaying game (adapted from adapted from ​Cthulhu Dark) of detectives, problem-solving, and rural mysteries in a fantastic world; or a farcical drug comedy.

You are members of an exclusive smoking club, the Lodge of the Wisefellows​, in the quiet halfling country of Irisfields​. As Wisefellows, you are occasionally called upon to solve mysteries and act as community troubleshooters.  Fortunately, you have been supplied with magical Elder Weed, ​which provides cosmic insights when smoked. Unfortunately, you are in actuality ​irascible scoundrels who do not belong anywhere near a crime scene. Also, if you imbibe too much of the weed, you may forget the troubles of the world and become lost in your own smoke. Permanently. It’s your first official case.  Good luck.

Content Warning: comedic drug use. This game will be played more as a farcical drug comedy, as I prefer the lighthearted over-the-top drama style of game. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. The game will go ahead with 2 or more signups.
