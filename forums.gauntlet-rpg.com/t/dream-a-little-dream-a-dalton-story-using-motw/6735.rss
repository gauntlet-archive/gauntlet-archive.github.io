    <description>Dream a Little Dream -- A Dalton Story

Monster of the Week



Dalton Kentucky is welcoming tourists in 1984. Local storytellers, crafts-folk, and artists are hoping out of towners will bring much needed cash. Outside the hills and hollers the world is wrapped in Reagan&#39;s America. Here in the valley, folks have gotten along for decades but the intolerance of the past still haunts memories. When a gay couple is murdered, old bigotry raises it&#39;s head and a spectre of hatred finds purchase. Our heroes must face the threats of the present as well as confront the atrocities of the past.





This game will deal with Homo/Trans/Queer-Phobia. It will confront bigotry and historical violence. It will delve into a dark past while allowing the PCs to shine a light of defiance. There is likely to be body horror, difficult choices, and religious intolerance. It is meant to be difficult, emotional, but ultimately uplifting. There will be a CATS discussion before play, lines and veils, the X-Card, and elements of &#39;Writers Room&#39; as safety tools. There will also be a curated list of Playbooks. Attendance in all session is preferred, but not required.

This is a 3 hour, 5 session run.
