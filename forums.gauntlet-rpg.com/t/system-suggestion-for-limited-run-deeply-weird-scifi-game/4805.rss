    <title>System suggestion for limited run, deeply weird scifi game?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/system-suggestion-for-limited-run-deeply-weird-scifi-game/4805</link>
    <description>Since my group has an excessive amount of time at home, we&#39;re going to run a limited-event side campaign. I could use some help with system suggestions that meet the following criteria:

* No more than 3-5 sessions, but not a oneshot either.
* Genre is lighthearted weird scifi. All characters, settings, and plots must be inspired by something from [this amazing 70&#39;s Scifi Art tumblr](https://70sscifiart.tumblr.com/).
* Something with a little crunch would be good.
* Explicit mechanics to support both players and GM introducing setting &amp; narrative would be nice (I&#39;m imagining some of the tools that Scum &amp; Villainy provides players via flashbacks, etc)
* Playable with basically no GM prep at all.

If Troika&#39;s classes were less Fantasy-ish, I&#39;d frankly just run that. I suspect what I&#39;m looking for is Troika, but in space. I know of a few scifi systems (Coriolis, Eclipse Phase, etc) but I think I&#39;d have to shoehorn them into the gonzo feel I&#39;m going for.

Any pointers?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Pro tip:<br>
Use the Troika character generator linked below and mash the generate character button until you see a background that matches the aesthetic you’re going for. The generator typically links to the source for third party backgrounds, and you may discover a whole set of backgrounds that suit your needs.</p>

              <p>Wow, thanks everyone for so many suggestions! There’s a lot of reading I have to do. Based on this, right now my shortlist is…</p>
<ul>
<li>Offworlders</li>
<li>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells (this looks like exactly the tone I’m going for. OSR gives me pause, but apparently they sprinkle in some storygame goodness)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further research also turned up a couple of “Dungeon World but scifi” games like Infinite Worlds that also sound interesting.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of game suggestions in here that sound fantastic, but would require a fair amount of reskinning to make it work. Normally that kind of thing is my jam, but since one of my key goals is laziness I’ll have to hold off on that. (A shame - Mindjammer looks neato)</p>

              <p>There’s a mammoth of a game called Mindjammer, its Fate Core based and it’s very modular in the sense you can take parts of the game out and it still works. You could reskin the parts you want to use and play. The main book in paper has 497 pages full of rules for different kind of things. You can make it as rule light or as crunchy as you like.</p>
