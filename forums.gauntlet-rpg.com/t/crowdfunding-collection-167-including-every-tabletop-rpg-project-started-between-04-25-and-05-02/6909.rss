    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2021/05/02/crowdfunding-collection-167/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #167, including every tabletop rpg project started between 04/25 and 05/02&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Following the May celebrations, I am back on time. Thus let’s get to the projects.

&lt;b&gt;Garden of the Giants&lt;/b&gt; is a game in which you’ll be playing anthropomorphic mice, who’ll experience adventures akin to those from children tales. The presentation is beautiful, and I like the setting. Plus, there is a preview for interested backers to check out. I think it’s worth having a look. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Courts of Blades&lt;/b&gt;, which focuses more on politics, diplomacy and skullduggery in a renaissance setting. You’ll be playing a coterie caught in the web of intruiges and drama, with a system based on Blades in the Dark. Worth having a look too. If you like to have 9 games with one project, &lt;b&gt;Pretentious Games for Villains and Bastards&lt;/b&gt; would be right up your ally. The games are made to be played in a one shots or micro-campaigns. anbieten. The kickstarter projects offers a little description of each of the games, for you to check out.
If you fancy Fantasy and PbtA, &lt;b&gt;Fantasy World&lt;/b&gt; should be right up your ally. The game offers an interesting looking setting, which doesn’t seem to be a standard Edo one, and it will be available in English and Italian! Maybe you like your Fantasy with more of a Sword and Sorcery drift, in which case you should have a look at &lt;b&gt;Blood, Sweat &amp; Steel&lt;/b&gt;. Systemwise it is based on Fudge, and the project highlights game specific rules.
If you are a fan of Science Fiction, I would recommend having a look at &lt;b&gt;ChangedStars&lt;/b&gt;. The game offers a bright yet prelious future, inspired by utopian, feminist SF works, as well as contemporary gritty ones. The whole game is d6 based with 4 attributes and looks solid, with quite interesting illustration. Thus it does see me tempted. &lt;b&gt;Ironsworn: Starforged&lt;/b&gt; transports the Fantasy Ironsworn setting and rules into the Science Fiction genre. The game can be played alone, with two players or with a „regular“ amount of players. The system is PbtA inspired, and the makers proved their mettle with previous projects. Check it out.
Maybe you are looking for a game book? &lt;b&gt;ROTATOR&lt;/b&gt; offers the first entry to a Science Fantasy story, written by a creator living in Ukraine. It features cool illustration, and is worth having a look for those alone.
There are of course more interesting projects, like the &lt;b&gt;Eldritch Sands&lt;/b&gt; setting for D&amp;D 5E, the bright green, printable &lt;b&gt;Hollow Dice&lt;/b&gt; with braille readability, or the &lt;b&gt;Shelf File of Holding&lt;/b&gt;, to stuff all your Kickstarter books into a nice DCC folder thing.
