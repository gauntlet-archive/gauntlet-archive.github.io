    <description>Hey folks!

In this post, we will highlight games for the upcoming week which have open seats and therefore the opportunity to add some more gaming fun to your week.

### [Dark Designs in Krevborna](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LXysVz2rlu42nvYzCQ2)
[date=2019-03-19 time=20:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
@RichardRuane will be running a hack of his very own &quot;Dark Designs in Verdigris&quot; that was published in Codex Emerald.  This game will take place in the gothic horror setting of Krevborna and feature the folk horror of Hexmoon Sabbath!

### [Masks: Phoenix Academy](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LXX1FIYUSSuUq1hek1w)
[date=2019-03-20 time=19:00:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot;  timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
@RoryM is running Masks using the Phoenix Academy as the core setting.  The Phoenix Academy is a special school for teens that are &#39;gifted&#39; and this setting can be found in the Masks supplement _Unbound_.   This is your chance to try out Masks if you have never had the chance!

### [The Watch](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LWcBrJhmcs8USFLZNw0)
[date=2019-03-23 time=16:30:00  format=&quot;LLLL&quot; timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]
@DavidMorrison will run The Watch, the critically acclaimed game in which you play women or non-binary soldiers who are the last defense against The Shadow.   Don&#39;t miss out on the opportunity to play 2017&#39;s Indie Game of the Year!</description>

              <p>Just chiming in to say this post is a great idea. It helps to dispel this notion that it’s impossible to get into Gauntlet Hangouts games!</p>

              <p>Gonna jump in here and comment on two of these games:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Dark Designs In Verdigris</em> is some of the best WoDu hacking going on right now. It is a great system and chargen is kind of charming. And I can also say the Jack Shear (author of the Krevborna setting) does great work. (I’ve been charmed by his Umberwell setting myself.)</li>
<li>
<em>The Watch</em> is a powerful game. It delves into some dark subjects, especially in the realm of gender, but it really can deliver. It’s got some great tech in it to to minimize the fighting and just focus on the fallout.</li>
</ul>
