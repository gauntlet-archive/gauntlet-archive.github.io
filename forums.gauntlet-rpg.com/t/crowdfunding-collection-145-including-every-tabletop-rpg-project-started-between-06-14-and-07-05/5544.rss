    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/07/05/crowdfunding-collection-145/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #145, including every tabletop rpg project started between 06/14 and 07/05&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The collection has no fewer than 70 projects, which makes it massive. Thanks to reason of time, the sheer amount and my health, I didn’t took a deep dive into every project, but hope to offer an interesting overview..

You will find that the &lt;b&gt;Slayers&lt;/b&gt; roleplaying game present you the opportunity to hunt monsters in a city that will be formed by your players. Next to 4 different classes the game sports an asynchron combat system, which I find very, very fascinating. There is a magazine based series of rpg games that will have have its first issue called &lt;b&gt;Adventure Presents: Tartarus Gate&lt;/b&gt;. Within just 54 pages you’ll find a complete SciFi horror game that has everything included required to play, but the 3 six-sided dice. If you like to design your own setting, the &lt;b&gt;BYTE&lt;/b&gt; RPG offers a d8 based system to facilitate it. Along with 7 ready made settings for those who aren’t that much into world building. If you are more a world building purist, and you are looking for „realistic“ rules, checkout the &lt;b&gt;5A System&lt;/b&gt;. It might got you covered.
If you are an anime fan and love the works of Studio Ghibli check out &lt;b&gt;Monster Care Squad&lt;/b&gt;. In this game you’ll play as elite veterinarian who have to care about mythical creatures. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;My Anime Story&lt;/b&gt;, if you like to implement your favorite anime setting yourself. Though the description is a bit bare bones.
Fully fleshed and aimed at kids it the rpg &lt;b&gt;Fairies of the Mistglade&lt;/b&gt;. Which has separate tiers for the age groups of 3 to 5, 5 to 8 and 8+ years old. With varying approaches to arithmetics to support the development of the children playing. The second edition of &lt;b&gt;SLICE&lt;/b&gt; on the other hand is designed by kids for kids. Which occurs to me is a sure way to make sure that kids are actually interested in it.
Straying away from children ~ maybe onto more people in puberty ~ who want to play a big, evil badguy, the &lt;b&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/b&gt; has that covered. You assume the role of overlords who want to plunder, burn stuff down and kill the heroes. Thus you got a villain meetings and fitting campaign. If I were 20 years younger, I’d think that’s cool. Though the system does actually sound interesting. If you are interested in classic fantasy, maybe check out &lt;b&gt;Alpha Duo&lt;/b&gt;. You can download the base version of the rules system for free. Then there’s the old school fantasy game &lt;b&gt;Chronicles of the Secret Time&lt;/b&gt; from Italy. Which looks very cool and is worth having a look.
Fans of rule-lite game should check out &lt;b&gt;Vizor&lt;/b&gt; with it’s dynamic character creation and utilization of cards, and/or &lt;b&gt;Runt&lt;/b&gt; which focuses on a narrative approach and is genre agnostic.
If you open up the &lt;b&gt;Storybox!&lt;/b&gt; project, you’ll get 8 narrative games in one kickstarter, and with Our Innermost Thoughts you’ll have 5 experience to explore yourself.
Maybe you are looking for a gamebook? Then check out the classical game book Myrrk Book One. It sounds legit. &lt;b&gt;The Dark Village&lt;/b&gt; isn’t classic at all, but I think it is a good fit for the category and worth checking out.
Next to all those games, I think you should give the &lt;b&gt;Campo de Mitos&lt;/b&gt; setting by Paco Jaen a chance. It takes the mythos to a place in Gibralta and looks very cool. The &lt;b&gt;Sinful RPG&lt;/b&gt; sourcebook will enable to add sinful sprincles into your scenario. Where I am just in love with the design of the &lt;b&gt;Elixier Dice&lt;/b&gt;. They got swirly, glittery stuff in them… beautiful! Though the dice from &lt;b&gt;Dice Macabre&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Dawn and Dusk&lt;/b&gt; got nice designs as well. Well, and if you are prone to say &lt;b&gt;No More Dice&lt;/b&gt;,… that project offers an abacus like alternative to roling. It might be among the &lt;b&gt;Things Heroes Say&lt;/b&gt;? Which is a collection of RPG phrases.
