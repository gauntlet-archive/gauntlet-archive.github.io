    <title>Splitting &quot;Moves&quot; into two categories</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/splitting-moves-into-two-categories/7443</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen a bit of the discussion on calling moves &quot;Moves&quot; and I thought, well, why not play with it!

So [fantasypunk](https://thegiftofdice.itch.io/fantasypunk), the game I&#39;m working on, has a bit of an OSR legacy (toned down through my hack), but I still want to nod at some classic trad fantasy game tropes for fun (only the not f-ed up ones, please).

So I am splitting moves into Moves and Features (or feats)

Things that you do remain in moves. Passive things go to Features.

Nothing huge or revolutionary, peeps! I know!

Feel free to drop your thoughts, opinions and even suggestions!</description>

              <p>Hi Gabe! Sure thing. An organization describes a move that allows you to have a small group at you disposal that helps you. Here is an example. This is from the playbook of the Factotum.</p>
<p><strong>THE HARGRAVE HOUSE INFORMALS:</strong></p>
<p>You skim money from the Hargrave House accounts in order to maintain a network of spies and enforcers throughout London. When you put out a word that you need help from someone in your network, select one of them from the list below and roll with Presence.</p>
<p><strong>On a 10+,</strong> they show up right away and do as you wish; any rolls associated with actions they help you with are taken at Advantage.</p>
<p><strong>On a 7-9,</strong> as above, but they take awhile to show up or they want something in exchange for their help, Keeper’s choice.</p>
<p><strong>On a miss,</strong> word gets back to you that they are dead, frfrom violence, consumption, or worse; cross them off the list.</p>
<p><strong>On a 12+,</strong> they also tell you something they have seen; the Keeper will give you helpful information or a Clue, their choice.</p>
<p>◒ Elsie Willow, a prostitute (red hair, laughs a lot, moth eaten dress).<br>
◒ Kip Longfellow, a street urchin (quite short, smells of hay, weirdly red)<br>
◒ Silas Gren, a butcher (muscular, bloody apron, looks older than he is)<br>
◒ Velma Thenwicket, a governess (pretty, usually stern, always tired)<br>
◒ Pig’s Ear, a pickpocket (hirsute, smells… bad, surprisingly poetic)<br>
◒ Brother Samuel, a disgraced vicar (clean cut, smells of juniper, soft hands)<br>
◒ Barrel Staves, a hooligan (an absolute unit)</p>

              <p>Jason Cordova details four types of moves in The Between:</p>
<p>“Broadly-speaking, The Between has four different types of moves: moves that <strong>automatically do a thing,</strong> moves that <strong>give you something</strong> for Personal Quarters, moves that are “gangs” or <strong>organizations</strong>, and moves that <strong>have die rolls</strong>. Some of the more complex playbook moves combine two or three of these types into one move.” (The Between, page 121)</p>
