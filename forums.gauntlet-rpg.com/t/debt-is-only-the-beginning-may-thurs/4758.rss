    <description>This is for two May sessions of *Debt is Only the Beginning*. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged, but not required. Rules will be taught. In session one we will establish tone, create our characters, and get going. Content Warning: Poverty.

&gt; The classic image of a mage is a wealthy scholar, usually male, sequestered away in an ivory tower. Surrounded by books, familiars, and strange instruments of all sorts, he is content to perform his experiments and work his rituals in pleasant solitude, knowing that the outside world will never intrude on what is truly important.
&gt; 
&gt; Would that you could have that. Ivory towers don’t come cheap nowadays. You’ve maybe heard of a friend of a friend who crashes on his uber-rich friend’s ivory-colored silk couches, but you couldn’t afford so much of a swatch of the couch fabric, let alone the penthouse in which the couch sits. There are still some mages in the one percent.
&gt; 
&gt; You’re not one of them. The best you can do is throw yourself on their tender mercies.

We will be using Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. [The Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines and Veils and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
