    <description>I&#39;m currently writing a rules text that is written from the point of view of your character. So instead of being addressed from the designer to the player, like:

**When it is your chapter, your character is in the spotlight. The story bends toward them. It’s your coin to flip. Other characters can figure prominently, and should, but in the end it’s about your character, and what happens to them is your call.**

...it is addressed from the character to the player, like so:

**When it’s my chapter, I’m in the spotlight. The story bends toward me. It’s your coin to flip. Others can figure prominently, and should, but in the end it’s about me, and what happens to me is your call.** 

It&#39;s a weird voice! It feels oddly intimate. For a long time I&#39;ve been inspired by the notion of Dosmukhamedov-style character agency (the idea that characters in fiction have their own voice, and their own needs and desires, basically), which this emphatically is not, but I think having your character tell you what to do with them suggests a certain mind-set for play and a certain sort of strange intratextual relationship between you and your tiny little character.
I&#39;m sure other games have done this but I can&#39;t think of any! Lots of fiction that has a game character speaking directly to the reader/player, but for rules text I&#39;m drawing a blank.</description>

              <p>Something I really like about this voice is that, even in this short snippet, it evokes empathy. It doesn’t feel like an extension of me or my ego but like someone else that I’m responsible for - the opposite of PCs as stolen cars. I think I’d feel it a lot more if something happened to the character.</p>

<p>This is a good point. Does this style of presentation require each person to read their own rules to themselves? It might get weird and confusing if the GM reads everything out loud.</p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I suggest you to test the idea in practice with a group as soon as possible. I would go as far as rewriting in first person the basic moves of DW, or a similar game, and use those to test against a group that doesn’t know the system yet. Actually, testing the technique alone by applying it to a game that you know works can help you recognize if a problem at the table originates in this choice of style or in a rule of your game that needs changing.</p>

              <p>As many have said, this approach is very intriguing, but aren’t you concerned that the “voice” you’re giving the charater <em>in the rules text</em> could clash with the “voice” the character will eventually have <em>in play</em>?</p>
<p>To use an example, I remember a let’s player arguing they liked Fallout 4 <em>way less</em> than Fallout 3 because the protagonist had <em>his own voice</em> acted dialogue lines. For them it was as if the recorded voice of the protagonist <em>interfered with the way they wanted to play their character</em>. So in a way the protagoinst wasn’t <em>their</em> character but rather <em>the</em> character. This in turn detracted from replayability.</p>
<p>This is of course very subjective.</p>

<p>but couldn’t you have some mechanics where characters act outside of their player’s control?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think what you suggested is a mess. I think it makes perfect sense in the context of first person instructional voice. If we are trying to extract our own persona from that of the character we act as, it would make sense that the character has drives we do not agree with and are contrary to our (the player’s) goals.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think you could take it a step further. I would propose that for every negative drive a character has, <em>another player</em> gets roleplay rights when that drive manifests. The initial proposal of mechanically forcing the character to act in ways you as a player do not want to engage in is a great learning tool in the “play to lose” or “roleplay not rollplay” camps. Taking that extra step and having your character literally act outside of your control can be a very strong (probably too strong for what most people want out of a typical ttrpg) demonstration of compulsions and addictions for people to experience in a safe way. Narratively, it can make overcoming that compulsion a huge achievement.</p>

<p>It’s kind of a cheap hack, but I could imagine a system where you pick (or roll for, if you’re really trying to take away control from the players) a character flaw, like, say, “Greedy,” and then add some kind of mechanical effect, like, “When you’re in the presence of gold, jewels, or luxury goods, you must immediately strive to take them however you can.”</p>
<p>Again, this is a mess, but it is kind of a direct mechanical interpretation of what Dosmukhamedov is talking about, right?</p>

              <p>I can’t find any publications by Anzhelika Dosmukhamedov on the Internet, or in the National Library catalogue. I wonder if she is talking about the phenomenon where it feels like the characters make their own decisions within the fiction rather than being directed by the writer?</p>
<p>The idea of a rebelling character reminds me of those team-building games in which a blindfolded person is directed through an obstacle course by their colleagues. And of the type of Hermetic astrology where the goal is not so much to see your future in the stars, but to find ways to escape destiny’s influence.</p>
<p>The closest existing game I can think of is <em><a href="https://rulebook.io/games/everyone-is-john/rules" rel="nofollow noopener">Everyone is John</a></em>, which requires all the players to share one character, John, and compete to have control over him.</p>

<p>To get at your last paragraph, I think a nice example would be each player being a Greek/Roman God and the PC being their favoured hero. That tension could then be exploited as it would be more natural to come to a head with “my hero is too beaten and broken to continue serving me adequately, do I reward them for their service or discard them for a fresh new model?” very Darkest Dungeon vibes.</p>

              <p>I love this. What I like most about it is that it gently discourages players to identify with their characters. It might be that success in this game isn’t about the character ‘winning’; or maybe the character will plead with the player to help them get as much treasure as possible. This is a fun thing to play with!</p>
<p>Another thing I like about this style is that it gives players a sense of an appropriate idiomatic character voice. I suppose there might be some players who would feel constrained by this; for me it would be a fun challenge.</p>
<p>I wonder if there’s a risk that writing like this will create the expectation that the game will feature the character rebelling from their player master in some way? (If not - there’s an idea for another game…)</p>

When your character is just a puppety construct of yours, it’s easy to overlook that creepiness. But when they turn round and talk to you — and especially when they look you in the eye and point out how utterly, slavishly dependent on you they are — that’s a whole other thing. Are you content for that creepiness to be a theme of your game?</p>

              <p>(sorry, I pressed post far too early on my previous post, please ignore)</p>
<p>I’ve seen this style of presentation before in games, but very rarely. The one example I’ve dredged up from memory is in the card game Blue Moon, designed by Reiner Knizia. It’s a two-player duelling game (in the same style as Magic the Gathering), and the gameplay effects on the cards are written in such a way that when I play a card, I read its text out loud to you.</p>
<p>This image shows what I mean: <a href="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/imagepagezoom/img/vyaVYGBwfh7xXp2ktt-KgcWxPVM=/fit-in/1200x900/filters:no_upscale()/pic158424.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cf.geekdo-images.com/imagepagezoom/img/vyaVYGBwfh7xXp2ktt-KgcWxPVM=/fit-in/1200x900/filters:no_upscale()/pic158424.jpg</a> – the “you” on the cards means “you, my opponent” and the “I”/“my” means “me, the player who is playing this card”.</p>
<p>In gameplay, it feels both strangely intimate (as you say), and also strangely stilted. But even as someone who does this kind of stuff for a living, I’m struggling to put my finger on why. If I had to guess, I’d say it is partly out of unfamiliarity, and partly because it feels weird that the card is <em>writing me a script</em>, telling me exactly what to say to my opponent. It really surfaces the ‘scripted play-acting’ element of a card game.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, you’re talking about something a bit different: not providing scripts for players to say to each other, but rather allowing my character to speak directly to me out of the page. I think that’s a really interesting idea, and it clearly has strong effects. But I also think you will have a significant barrier of understanding to cross before readers get what’s going on. The exchange above with <a class="mention" href="/u/calris">@calris</a> illustrates the kind of “huh?” reaction that I think you can expect from readers. Having got over that barrier, I think it could be really cool and interesting.</p>
