This is a single session one-shot game of Lizzy &amp; Darcy from the anthology [You &amp; I: Roleplaying Games for Two](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255136/You--I-Roleplaying-Games-for-Two). The game allows the players to re-tell and re-fashion the story of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, exploring some of the what-ifs and what-might-have-beens along the way. The game is a GMless structured freeform with an act structure that broadly follows the narrative beats of their courtship and key decision moments, but how exactly they befall and the consequences are yours to decide. The game uses a basic playing card mechanic to inspire but also constrain as in keeping with the time.

The game itself will be taught as part of the session, so no knowledge of the game is needed. A basic knowledge of, and interest in, the characters is recommended.

If we have 2 players then I will facilitate. If only 1, I will step into the other role.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) will be in use.
