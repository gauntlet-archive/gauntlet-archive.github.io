    <title>Any GMs interested in an animated campaign?</title>

    <description>Sorry, I wasn&#39;t quite sure where to put this.

As the title suggest I&#39;m trying to find the right fit for an animated campaign I&#39;ve been developing for about a year and I was told there&#39;s a lot of great GMs here. It&#39;s a heavily produced project, atmospherics, ambience tracks, music, animation. There&#39;s a lot going on with it, but you can essentially think of it as an actual play with methodically placed audio done in post and occasional animation to accompany the plot. It&#39;s also all encased in a template provides the viewer with all kinds of information about the game.

I guess you could say this is a bit of a mutant as far as TTRPG shows go, but it&#39;s a passion project of mine, so I&#39;m going to push everything it has as far as I can...which brings us to this. I&#39;m trying to find a GM that can help bring my work to life. Maybe someone here is interested or knows someone who would be, but if you think it&#39;s something you&#39;d be into let me know. :slight_smile:</description>

              <p>We use Dungeon World as it can get a lot done quickly and lends itself to colorful story telling. That said, what we are looking for specifically is a competent GM. Someone who’s good with their voice, their elocution and the various other aspects of the role such as monster creation, world building, improv and the like.</p>

              <p>I would LOVE to do this.  The only thing I know of like this is D&amp;D Story Animated.  I listen to this series and would love to be included in something like this.  It would take some work and I am not sure what it would all include but I can say I find them very entertaining (even though I often find D&amp;D somewhat tedious in real life. - straight up not gonna play D&amp;D 2, 3.5, or 4 ever again).  What systems would you be interested in doing this with?  How are you thinking of creating the group?  So…many…questions.  To be clear I have no art skills.</p>
