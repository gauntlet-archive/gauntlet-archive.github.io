          <p>Something a few people mentioned here, and is stated in the <em>Blades</em> book itself, is how many of the mechanics are left up to the players to tweak in order to define their own experience. I like that in theory, but I also think it could be made more explicit, rather than being left to theoretically form for each group over time as they play.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’d be useful to include some sort of checklist to go through with your group during the rest of your setup, where you’d talk about these things explicitly. I might be missing it, but I don’t think the game itself has something like this. Some of the recurring mechanical points of confusion/customization I’ve seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How will resistance and armor work in our game? Do you nullify harm or downgrade it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will Tier work in our game? Will we ignore it? Will every roll against a higher Tier faction be made at reduced effect, or is it just a general indication of difficulty for a mission? (thinking of this thread on the Blades forums: <a href="https://community.bladesinthedark.com/t/newbie-gm-wrestling-with-tier-and-reduced-effect/949?u=deusexbrockina" rel="nofollow noopener">https://community.bladesinthedark.com/t/newbie-gm-wrestling-with-tier-and-reduced-effect/949?u=deusexbrockina</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does Standard effect look like in our game? Maybe provide a few examples, like “if you’re trying to attack someone, do you kill them outright, or will it take multiple wounds? If you’re picking a lock, hacking a computer, etc. etc.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people might prefer to let these things come together naturally as they play, but I think I prefer the idea of having a conversation up front.</p>
