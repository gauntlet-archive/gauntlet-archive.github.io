    <description>*Emotionally volatile monsters play DnD in the 80s.*

Saturday afternoons in January AEDT

Monsterhearts 2 is a PbtA game about the messy emotional lives of teenage monsters. This series is set in the suburbs of 1987, where your Principal has decided (inexplicably?) on a convenient way to deal with Springwood High&#39;s troublemakers: forcing them to join the school&#39;s DnD club, and making the bad-boy jocks, stoners and mean girls hang out with the nerds. As they roll the dice they&#39;ll discover unexpected depths of similarity and difference, and begin to learn each other&#39;s most dangerous secrets. But the worst fears of the 80s are also true: DnD really is an occult conspiracy, and it’s pushing the characters towards real magic and murder.

I emphasise that this is not an 80s DnD simulator, and no actual rules knowledge (of Monsterhearts 2 or Red Box DnD) is required or expected. Some familiarity with DnD tropes and/or 80s teen movie tropes is probably useful, but not essential. 

The game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct and use safety tools including lines and veils, the X Card, and the open door policy. 

Sessions will be three hours on StreamYard, with breaks on the hour. Attendance at all sessions is encouraged but not required. I&#39;ll be recording only if all players consent.
