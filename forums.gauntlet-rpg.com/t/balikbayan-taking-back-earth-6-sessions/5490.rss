**NOTE: Please only sign up if you&#39;re interested in playtesting!** BALIKBAYAN: Returning Home is still in beta, and I will be using a slightly different version of the published game.

The all access time for this game is  June 29, 2020 8:00 PM Manila Time (GMT+8)

*It is the far future. Earth has been abandoned for generations. Humanity left for brighter stars, richer planets and shining colonies. To fuel their dreams of a better tomorrow, the humans turned to the Elementals and their magic. This magic is an invaluable source of power and labor. Machines were created to harness and enslave the Elementals .You were one of these Enslaved Elementals. You are machines that echo the legendary magic you once possessed. You and your friends are among the few who have managed to return to Earth. What remains of Earth’s cities is falling apart. The Corp won’t let go of you so easily either. But shining through the cracks is a magic that is ready to be reborn.* ***Can you outrun The Corp long enough and bring forth the Rebirth of magic? Will you survive this revolution you’ve started, or will The Corp recapture you?***

I will email everyone a week ahead to confirm attendance. A seat has been set aside for Max Kämmerer.

***BALIKBAYAN: Returning Home*** is a *Belonging Outside Belonging* game, but we are playing the GMed version of the game.

**Touchstones:** Shadowrun, Ghost in the Shell, other Cyberpunk stories but with a strong focus on machine-magic and revolution.

**Content Warning** : themes of oppression and violent capitalism may come up naturally through play.

**System**  : [BALIKBAYAN: Returning Home](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/balikbayan)

**Duration**  : Six 3-hour sessions

**Breaks**  : 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : Yes, but made public only if consent by all the players

**Attendance**  : Joining all four sessions is ideal but not required, the first session will mostly be character and cafe creation

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, an open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.
