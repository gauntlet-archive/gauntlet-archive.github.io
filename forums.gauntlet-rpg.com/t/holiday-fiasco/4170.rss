    <title>Holiday Fiasco!</title>

    <description>Here are two holiday-themed one shot sessions of Fiasco! These sessions are completely independent of one another; feel free to sign up for one or both. 

In the first session, we&#39;ll be playing the &quot;Poppleton Mall&quot; playset from the American Disasters playset collection. The movie inspirations for this playset include: Bad Santa, Mall Rats, The Blues Brothers, Dawn of the Dead, Elf

In the second session, we&#39;ll be playing &quot;The Last Christmas in O&#39;Hare&quot; playset by Brian Liberge. The movie inspirations for this playset include: 2012, Airplane!, Airport, Catch Me if You Can, Die Hard 2, Heist

FIASCO is an award-winning, GM-less game for 3-5 players by Bully Pulpit Games, designed to be played in a few hours with six-sided dice and no preparation. During a game you will engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It’s like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it’d take to watch one.

These sessions will be played using Streamyard and will be recorded and posted on YouTube if all players agree. We will have a tone/content discussion prior to play, including setting out lines and veils; the X-card will also be in use.
