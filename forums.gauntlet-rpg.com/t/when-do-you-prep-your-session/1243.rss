    <title>When do you prep your session?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/when-do-you-prep-your-session/1243</link>
    <description>As much as it pains me to say, I find prepping those few hours before the session, at the eleventh hour so to speak, my most fruitful time to prep sessions. Something I&#39;m thinking about doing in the future is to prep the following session right at the end of the current session!

Assuming you do at all, when is your favorite time to prep?</description>

              <p>Unless I’m playing a prep-heavy game (which I don’t really do anymore), I do more of a “get my head at the right place” prep (as in “consuming media that inspires me”) than prepping resources for the game itself. I tend to keep my prep at a maximum of one page of very sparse notes, just highlighting questions I want the players to answer and broad ideas for themes. That kind of prep takes at most one hour, and I usually do it the evening before the game.</p>

              <p>I run my weekly Waterdeep: Dragon Heist session on Wednesday evenings, and lately I’ve been trying to do the bulk of my reading ahead on weekends. Then, I use my lunches on Monday and Tuesday to review what I’ve read and adapt it for my group and into notes I can use during session. I find that not waiting until the last minute (i.e., the hour before session) has dramatically reduced how stressed I feel about running the game. When I’m not running a published adventure, I’ve got a lot of mileage (no pun intended) out of putting on my favorite game soundtracks during my commute and simply thinking about the game while driving.</p>

              <p>Before starting a new game I tend to spend a lot of time pouring over the rules trying to internalize them so when we play there is zero looking things up. Ideally, even if I can’t remember the rule then I can make a ruling that is in the spirit of the system if I “get” the rules system.</p>
<p>After that, I try to do very little prep. I might roll on tables to get an adventure seed that’s about a sentence long and expand during play or I might look over the clocks for any actions the players have put into the game, otherwise, I prefer to just bounce off the players’ actions during the session.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/michael">@Michael</a> I do the “explain things” in the car as well! Especially if I’m going to be introducing a new concept at the next session. I tend to teach systems piecemeal as we play (e.g., I never talk about combat until a session we’re about to have some, so I practice a little summary for it). Obviously this happens less over the life of a campaign but I find it really helpful.</p>

              <p>I like to start a few days before hand. It takes me about an hour or three to write down 20 points about the upcoming adventure. I try to get NPCs, locales, motivations and plots hammered out. I write it in short form, just little reminders that’ll jog my memory.</p>
<p>When I run my game, I know what’s going on. I throw stuff at the PCs and have the world react to what they’re doing. I fill in missing NPC bits on the fly.</p>
<p>This works well for games like Fate, Masks, or D6 Star Wars. I don’t think I’d be able to do it for D&amp;D or other games where you need detailed NPC stats.</p>
<p>All this being said, I actually don’t need any prep for my Vanagard games. The cards and runes provide all I need to make up everything on the fly.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to do a full on Vanagard RPG sometime. I major selling point will be less time for Norns to prep.</p>

              <p>GMless one-shots are my sweet spot, so there’s not much prep to be done. But for longer games, my prep mostly consists of coming up with a juicy way to launch the next session. For example, I just finished the first session of a two-part Dead Scare game, and the PCs had just made it to the church where most of the neighborhood is sheltering. So sometime the day of the next session, I’ll come up with a good idea for who greets them and what they find at the church – but everything beyond that will be improvised during the game.</p>

              <p>Depend on what kind of game I’m running. For my casual guys, I usually use the time I have to get to where we’re playing to think of something. For my long-running campaigns, I do more prep before, especially if we’re starting a new arc. I like to think about the basic premise and scenarios one or two weeks before the game (we play every two or three months on the weekend) while I’m walking, so that takes more or less an hour (unless I get distracted by dogs, bikes, trees or other things). Then I percolate on that a bit and usually plan to write things down two or three days before the game (but often I just type some things up during the train ride shortly before the game).</p>
<p>I have yet to run something that needs a lot of prep for the Gauntlet. I guess I might prep more for that, though.</p>

              <p>I’m a fairly low prep GM all things considered, but that doesn’t mean I don’t like rolling up lots of random dungeons when I have time. My workload at my main job tends to be feast or famine, so if I’m having a slow day I’ll usually prep some stuff. In theory I’d love to use <a class="mention" href="/u/jasoncordova">@jasoncordova</a>’s 7-3-1 technique every time but I rarely end up coming with more than one or maybe two things at a time. That said, Freebooters 2E gives a lot of great tools for generating dungeons and settlements and followers, so I have a lot of fun rolling those up when I have a chance. Otherwise I keep a running list of notes for campaign/encounter/setting ideas on my phone so I can add to it whenever I need. My main prep before a new session is going back over the notes from the previous session, and then if there’s anything of my pre-prepped stuff that I might be fitting in I’ll make sure I have those handy.</p>

              <p>Mentally I do a lot during my commute but that is often high level stuff, the more fiddly bits such as NPC stats (I’m running D&amp;D 5e at the moment) I tend to do the day of the session during my lunch break. Partially that’s to give me time to work out the likely elements that could come into play during the session but also because I put it off. I’m not a massive fan of how D&amp;D approaches stat blocks / monsters etc but for now I’m stuck with it.</p>

              <p>My prep has evolved a great deal over the years and become very slimline. After character gen I do some work to structure the stuff I’ve picked up into a one-page reference sheet that I keep updated over time. My format recently has been to list the players and their characters in one corner, list key threats in another corner, key NPCs in another corner and then the third corner varies by game (e.g. in a recent Blades campaign it was key factions).</p>
<p>After a session I’m normally buzzing with energy that I actively need to dissipate in order to be able to sleep. So I use the half hour or so after the session to write a note of what happened, campaign journal-style. If I’m still buzzing I might do a bit more, like noodle around asking questions about the game and/or developing threats. Or doodle pictures of stuff from the session.</p>
<p>Pre-session prep happens in the day or two before a session. I can’t always wait until the eleventh hour because of real life stuff, so I try to pick a time when I’ll actually be able to sit down and think. But - as a campaign wears on, I’m likely so comfortable with it all that the final 30 mins before the session is enough, and can serve as double-duty: prep and warm-up.</p>
<p>During the second stage I go over my notes from the last session, and other materials (my notes from character gen, notes from earlier sessions, previous prep notes). Most recently I’ve been using this to draw out short lists, generally some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stuff I know needs to happen and will almost certainly form the basis for a specific scene (a conversation someone said they wanted to have as a scene; the funeral of the guy who died last session; an imminent threat that can’t be put off)</li>
<li>Particular things I want to highlight if I get the chance, either for in-fiction reasons or for reasons of pacing etc (specific NPCs, threats, players who are owed some spotlight time)</li>
<li>Things I need to remember (prompts for Moves or other mechanics I keep forgetting to use, that kind of thing)</li>
<li>Active threats that I can draw on as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>My prep becomes more and more lax over the course of a campaign though, as each session creates slightly less buzz of “OMG exciting new game” and I feel less anxiety about knowing what I’m doing.</p>

              <p>I have two stages of prep for campaign play. One is a longer phase prior to, or after, session zero, depending on if it’s a collaborative world building game or not.</p>
<p>This is where most of my time is spent in prep: creating factions, making notes, thinking about fronts, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The second phase of prep is just after and just before each session. It’s never very long, and it often seems to get shorter each session as we have more and more plot hooks to draw upon.</p>
