    <title>Thirsty Cheerleading Lesbians (4 sessions in April)</title>

    <description>For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you&#39;ve joined the Gauntlet within the last six months, including anyone from GCOG. 

You’re members of the defending National Cheerleading Champions, maybe the greatest cheerleading team in the world - but for how long? The squad is struggling to hold together under the pressure of competing cliques, rivalries, crushes and break-ups, not to mention pressure from a conservative college administration. But if you can’t overcome your differences and channel your sexual tensions and petty feuds into elite athletic performance, hated nearby rivals from Trinity College are ready to steal your title. 

This will be a very light reskin of Thirsty Sword Lesbians to shift the game’s physical confrontations from swordfighting to competitive cheerleading. My goal is melodramatic sports comedy - Bring It On (an absolute classic!) is a key touchstone, but you can also think Mighty Ducks or Bend It Like Beckham, etc, with a heavy sprinkling of Netflix doco, Cheer. Expect a lot of heavily queer romance and flirtation, relationship drama, and fractious relationships that need to be mended if you’re going to succeed when it really counts. 

The game will/could include subject matter around competitive pressure, bullying, etc, but will stay fairly light and shouldn’t include anything that would be out of place in a teen movie. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door policy as safety tools, and the game will run according to the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.

You don’t need to know any rules, which will be taught during play. 

Sessions will be played on StreamYard and recorded if all players consent. The series will consist of four three-hour sessions with breaks on the hour. Joining all sessions is not required but you do need to sign up for all sessions you want to attend. 

Open access time is 8:30am on the 5th May AEDT.
