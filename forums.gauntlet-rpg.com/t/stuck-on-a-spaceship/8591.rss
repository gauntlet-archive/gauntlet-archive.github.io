    <title>Stuck on a Spaceship</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/stuck-on-a-spaceship/8591</link>
    <description>Just finished Dying Hard on Hardlight Station horror module from Mothership as a christmas special start for an Impulse Drive campaign.  Characters are an Infiltrator, Outsider and Scoundrel on a Vanguard ship - basically non-combat response team for space CIA for the good of the galaxy.  Mass Effect 2 with less guns.

One of the players is keen for an adventure just on the spaceship so they have more social Moves occuring.  I keep getting stumped thinking of anything other than a murder mystery.  Also I was wondering if there are any good improv prompt questions like you have for Dungeon Starters to help with single location plots - or &quot;base under siege&quot; like many Doctor Who episodes have.  Possibly an &quot;out of gas&quot; Firefly thing?</description>
