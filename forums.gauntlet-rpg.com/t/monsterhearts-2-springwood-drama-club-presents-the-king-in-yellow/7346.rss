    <description>***One seat in this game is saved for Ferret.***

Every year the Springwood High drama club presents a play, and their parents and classmates dutifully drag themselves along to watch them butcher present classics like  *Our Town* ,  *Bye Bye Birdie*  or whatever. What will happen when the drama club and its secret monsters find a banned play with terrifying powers, corrupting all who read it, eroding reality and demanding absolute conformity to the mysterious power of the Yellow Sign? And even more important, will your crush  *ever*  notice you? 

Monsterhearts 2 is a game about the messy emotional lives of teenage monsters. In this game, you play members of the drama club (or their friends, lovers, hangers-on and wannabes) as the eldritch power of an impossible text drags your school and city into the weird, uncanny orbit of an alien city called Carcosa. The game draws on classic high school movies, the Yellow King stories of Robert Chambers and other writers, and Jesse Ross’s set-up for a theatre-themed Monsterhearts game from Codex Emerald. 

Monsterhearts can include heavy themes and content around teenage sexuality, power and control, including both sex and conflict between PCs. The game will also include horror elements, but focus more on the weird, eerie and angsty than the horrific. We’ll be using Lines and Veils, the X Card and the Open Door as safety tools, and the game will run under the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html. 

We’ll be playing over StreamYard, with short breaks on the hour. Sessions will be recorded and posted only by consent of the players. I’ll send a group email about a week before the first session to confirm interest, share play materials, etc. 

Open access time for signups is 10:00am 5 September AEST.
