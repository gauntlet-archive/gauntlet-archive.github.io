    <description>I just need to say this...

I absolutely *loved* Discern Realities and even though I miss it dearly, I&#39;ve been really enjoying Fear of a Black Dragon over the last couple of years.

@jasoncordova, @coalhada, you create such a lovely vibe - very few podcasts manage to do this for me.  I find listening to it to be akin to settling back in a comfy leather chair in front of a roaring fire.  The dulcet tones, the obvious care and passion you put into your prep, and your insights all weave a magical spell.

So I wanted to post this just in case people don&#39;t compliment you on what you have created enough. Thank you, thank you, and long may it continue!</description>

              <p>I originally just came to the podcast to listen to old D&amp;D modules.  But the quality of the podcast is beyond any others I have ever found, and listening to any modules, even OSR ones you never heard of, is pure gold for learning what makes a module great.</p>

              <p>Interestingly, neither am I. I mostly run Dungeon World/Homebrew World, but I’m always on the lookout for cool OSR-style adventures that I can adapt.</p>
