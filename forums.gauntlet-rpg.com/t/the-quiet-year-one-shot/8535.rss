**Waitlisting only.**

&gt; *For a long time, we were at war with The Jackals. Now, finally, we’ve driven them off, and we’re left with this: a year of relative peace. One quiet year, with which to build our community up and learn again how to work together. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive the encounter. This is when the game will end. But we don’t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.*

The Quiet Year is a map game. You define the struggles of a community living after the collapse of civilization, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year. Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.

The game is played using a deck of cards – each of the 52 cards corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each card triggers certain events – bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck. At the end of the quiet year, the Frost Shepherds will come, ending the game.

The Quiet Year occupies an interesting space – part roleplaying game, part cartographic poetry.

**System:**  [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year) (no experience with the system is necessary, rules will be taught; familiarity with online whiteboard tools such as Miro is a plus)

**Content warnings** : Community discord and contempt

**Duration** : 4 hrs

**Breaks** : 5-10 min breaks on the hour

**Venue** : Zoom (a link will be provided the night before via email).

**Recording:**  No

**Safety Tools:**  Lines &amp; Veils, X-Card and Script Change. This game will follow [the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the Open Door Policy is in place, meaning anyone should feel free to leave the game, or cancel as needed.

**Play aids:**  Gauntlet playaids are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sO7iRkSkbzO523rw8mcQP0g6yXwKkI1Y) thanks to Gerrit, [playingcards.io](https://playingcards.io/) for virtual playing cards &amp; an online whiteboard collaboration tool for the map (probably Miro).

**Communication:**  via email for confirmation, Zoom &amp; Miro details
