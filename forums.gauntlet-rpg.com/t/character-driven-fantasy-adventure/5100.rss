    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/character-driven-fantasy-adventure/5100</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!

Wondering if you have any suggestions for games (preferably PbtA) that could do a sort of fantasy adventure/journey that isn&#39;t much about combat, dungeon crawling, etc. More about the characters forming relationships, exploring strange new places, meeting new people, etc. Somewhat surreal and melancholic.

Dungeon World seems to adhere way too closely to D&amp;D for our group&#39;s tastes. I&#39;m considering Fellowship, because despite a lot of the traditional trappings it looks like it could be molded into different types of stories, but it would definitely still be combat heavy. Any other suggestions?

I&#39;m kind of looking for a game that fits the emotional tenor of a Fall of Magic, while also having playbooks and dice and a GM.</description>

I would just like to mention how <a href="http://tiny.cc/FantasyWorldRPG" rel="nofollow noopener">Fantasy World</a> is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a DW hack… but actually a AW2 hack than, because it’s fantasy, started out adopting a few elements from DW too, which have now almost completely been shed away.<br>
DW is a nice game, but it just doesn’t do what I look for in a fantasy story.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/chalk_baphomet">@chalk_baphomet</a> see if the intro (with a handy TL:DR section) is more or less up your alley.<br>
Also, check out the <em><strong>Long Rest</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Journey</strong></em> moves. I have a feeling you’ll like them <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>My Veil hack’s very much about just life and existence for adventurers in a fantasy city. It can be a little Picaresque, depending on how you want to play it. It doesn’t really cover travel-- assumes a central urban setting.</p>
