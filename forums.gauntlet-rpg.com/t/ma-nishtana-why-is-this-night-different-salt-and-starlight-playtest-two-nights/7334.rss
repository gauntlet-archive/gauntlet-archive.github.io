We are more than excited to playtest **Ma Nishtana: Why is this Night Different?** again on the Gauntlet!

Ma Nishtana is a ritual experience inspired by the **Passover Seder** and the story of Hebrew Exodus from Egypt.You need not be religious nor Jewish to play. This is a **rotating-gm style story game** in which we play to examine the magic of ritual and collective action. 

This is a game in development and we are looking for players to give feedback to make this a more welcome game for everyone. The play session itself, including character creation and rules workshop is expected to last about **2.5 hrs with about 15 minutes left over for discussion** and reflection.

The story we tell together may deal with themes of loss, subjugation, violence, and deprivation. To navigate this tonal landscape we will be using lines and veils**, a version of **scriptchange**, and an **open-door policy** will be in effect. We will not be recording. [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play.

In the email we send on August 12, we will include a link to the character keeper so you can review and adjust the lines and veils.

We will be meeting over Zoom, the link of which will be sent in the email.


To perform the game’s rituals, we ask that you gather the following:
- Something to drink (water is fine!) 
- Something you do not particularly like, but are willing to eat 
- Something dirty and something to clean it with
- Something that is old or has been in your life for a long time 
- Something you can break or rip 

Here’s a link to the guidebook if you’d like to check out the game before signing up.[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6PNOGziPiMyFn33vtyq0loxPH66pTgiPf8qpZ0wBwU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6PNOGziPiMyFn33vtyq0loxPH66pTgiPf8qpZ0wBwU/edit?usp=sharing) 

One seat is being reserved for a designer who expressed interest in playing.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours.

There will be 2 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

Please let us know if you have any questions! benbisogno@gmail.com
