<p>I try very hard to neutrally explain the game tradition I play and know about without judging others too harshly.  I recommend you do the same, because as much as it‚Äôs fun to talk smack about classic games as ‚Äúboard games‚Äù where mechanical achievement is the metric for success, remember that there‚Äôs plenty of folks who see story/genre emulation/narrative games as little more then ‚Äúimprov theater‚Äù but that neither of these attitudes is productive.  There‚Äôs enormous amounts of overlap between classic, narrative and even contemporary traditional play that gatekeepers from each of these playstyles insist are wrong fun.  I don‚Äôt agree - I think there‚Äôs a lot to learn from an interchange between playstyles, even to the point of mechanical borrowing - for example I‚Äôve PbtA concepts like clocks and moves applied quite effectively in classic system sandboxes.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve managed to play a contemporary trad game using mechanics and play style from the classic dungeon crawl - that is tacticalish combat and vaguely superhero PCs with builds who need to worry about running out of rations and try to avoid combat encounters through RP or trickery. I suspect similar hybrids are possible among lots of playstyles. Perhaps Instead of dismissing ‚Äúmechanical achievement‚Äù imagine what it would look like and how it‚Äôd effect a game of the style you prefer? What effect does the explicit rule ‚ÄúYou WIN when you gather X amount of in game currency‚Äù do to the style of game you like?</p>

          <p>I hope for play to show a change from what was,  to find something new about myself and/or others, and to enjoy the company of my friends.<br>
If it doesn‚Äôt have closure, besides the closure of us going to our separate homes, but has meaningful or thought-provoking change, I‚Äôm okay with it.<br>
I don‚Äôt need resolution.<br>
I mean, the answer to most of these questions is usually ‚Äúit depends‚Äù.  If it feels like a game instead of a story, I might want some more transparency on success and failure.  If it feels more like a story, I‚Äôll be more accepting of this sorta thing.</p>

          <p>I like to think about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù an RPG in the same was as you might win an escape room or finish a scavenger hunt. For me (and maybe many people?) I‚Äôm not as worried about getting the best possible outcome (i.e. that I did better than everyone else), but I <em>do</em> want to feel like I engaged my skills (e.g. acting, problem-solving, creativity, etc.) and that I got to see and experience something new or unexpected.</p>

          <p>I am in no way trying to deliver a one-true-way speech, I apologize if my tone came off as that. When I stated that DnD is on the board game end of the RPG spectrum, that was not a denigration. I think DnD and other miniature-heavy, dungeon crawling genre games are as valid as any other style of RPG.</p>
