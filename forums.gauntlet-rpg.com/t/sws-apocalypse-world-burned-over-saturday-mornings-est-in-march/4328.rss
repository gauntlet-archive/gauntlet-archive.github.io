    <description>**Star Wars Saturdays: Apocalypse World - Burned Over - Dathomir**
![](upload://8mws494DooCtADh0D70UIHc48o4.jpeg)

Something&#39;s wrong with the galaxy and I don&#39;t know what it is. It used to be better, of course, it did, or so they say.

In the golden age of legend, with the Republic and the Jedi Order, when there was enough to eat and enough hope, when people could lift their eyes and see beyond the horizon, beyond the day. Children were born happy and some even grew up rich. The Jedi disappeared. The Republic was replaced by the Empire. Then, the Empire fell.

Now we&#39;ve got this. 

Lawmakers stand against the screaming elements and all comers, keeping safe as many as they can. Medics and Gearcutters run constant battle against there&#39;s not enough and blaster bolts fly and everything breaks. Volatiles, Vigilants, Weaponized, and Undaunted carve out what they can and defend it with blood and blasters. Operators search and scavenge, looking for that opportunity, that one perfect chance. Monarchs remember beauty, or invent beauty anew, cup it in their hands and whisper come and see, and don&#39;t worry now about what it will cost you. 

And Brain-pickers, oh, Brain-pickers see what none of the rest of us will: the world&#39;s psychic maelstrom, the terrible desperation and hate pressing in at the edge of all perception, it is the world now.

And you, who are you? This is what we&#39;ve got, yes. What are you going to make of it?

*We&#39;re adapting The Apocalypse World: Burned Over RPG, a post-apocalypse game, for Star Wars!*

Sawyer Rankin is a special guest for this series.

-----------------------------------

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will be recorded assuming all parties agree.
