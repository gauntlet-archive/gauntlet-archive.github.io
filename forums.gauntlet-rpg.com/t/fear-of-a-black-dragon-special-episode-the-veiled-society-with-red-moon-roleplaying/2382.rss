    <description>We have a special crossover podcast episode in the Fear of a Black Dragon feed. @Coalhada recently ran The Veiled Society for the folks at Red Moon Roleplaying. I listened to the whole thing and it’s pretty good! I’m not normally into DnD actual plays, but the production values are really nice and Tom is a very charming GM. If you need something to keep you entertained tonight, this would be a fun choice:

<p>Agreed, albeit it fell short in practice for me purely because of the constant music, which makes it very hard for me to follow the dialogue. Hearing a discussion of a module before play is novel and has lots of potential. It’s not always easy when listening to a play session alone to really grasp what an adventure is about, or what else it might have to offer, and this approach could work very well.</p>

              <p>I was rather looking forward to this. Recording quality seems pretty good, with the voices nice and clear, but as much as as I’d like not to be negative I’m afraid the continual music makes it impossible to enjoy. Was the intention to make it sound like an Ultima-style computer game? Sorry to say it, but no RPG recording has ever been improved by music or sound effects, for all that they seem to be increasingly in vogue.</p>
<p>Sadly, I had to abandon this one.</p>
