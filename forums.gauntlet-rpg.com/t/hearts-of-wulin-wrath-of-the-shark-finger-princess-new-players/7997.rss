    <description>## **For the first 48 hours please only sign up if you either a) haven&#39;t yet played or signed up for a standard Gauntlet Calendar session or b) haven&#39;t played or signed up for Hearts of Wulin.**

A figure of supernatural power has been devastating weddings. You have been called to help stop the Shark Finger Princess&#39; rampage so that a marriage uniting previously warring clans can occur. But is The Princess the real threat? Or are there other forces-- mundane and supernatural-- operating from the shadows. Hearts will be broken, loves confessed, and villains confronted. What entanglements and passions draw you to the event-- do you want to see the wedding happen?

This is for  a two-shot (June Saturdays 0900 US Eastern) of *Hearts of Wulin* using the supernatural and xianxia elements. *Hearts of Wulin* is a PbtA of wuxia melodrama in the vein of *The Untamed, Painted Skin* and *The* *Bride with White Hair*, but no familiarity is required. Rules will be taught. In session one, discuss tone &amp; safety, create characters, establish entanglements and get to playing. An array of NPCs will be provided as lovers, rivals, friends, and foes.

Rules will be taught. Attendance at both sessions is strongly encouraged; pleas sign up for both halves.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
