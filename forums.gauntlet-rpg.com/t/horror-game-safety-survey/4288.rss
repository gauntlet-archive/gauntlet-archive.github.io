    <title>Horror game safety survey</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/horror-game-safety-survey/4288</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to be running at least one scenario of **Dread** at PAX East and I&#39;m interested in having a quick, anonymous safety tool that allows players to set limits on what material they are not comfortable with. All the safety tools I&#39;ve seen (X-card, Lines &amp; Viels, etc.) seem like they must be invoked retroactively IE once a player has been pushed to or past their comfort level. I&#39;m hoping that I can have a tool which shortcuts the kind of feel for boundaries you get with familiar players without requiring everyone to spill their guts about what upsets them.

I&#39;ve written up a quick primer that I can have each player answer individually and return to me so there is no peer pressure involved or requirement to verbalize personal issues in front of strangers. I figure once I get the answers I&#39;ll just tailor the game to the lowest level answer in each category. List of horror themes are below, answers are the same for every one. 

Is there anything missing? Are the answers properly descriptive and non-judgmental? Is this too much of a hassle for a con game (for the players or the GM)?

*Please answer the following questions regarding your comfort levels with various kinds of horror. While we will probably not use every theme, assume there is a chance any of them might occur unless you specify otherwise. Based on everyone’s answers, only the **lowest** indicated level of each theme will occur.*

**Guts, Gore, and grossness**
*1. I’d prefer if none of this is included*
*2. I’m comfortable with a minimal amount of this content*
*3. I’m comfortable with this content, but don’t go overboard*
*4. The more the better*

**Bugs, disease, and creepy crawlies**
*1. I’d prefer if none of this is included*
*2. I’m comfortable with a minimal amount of this content*
*3. I’m comfortable with this content, but don’t go overboard*
*4. The more the better*

**Regrets, guilt, and personal trauma**
*1. I’d prefer if none of this is included*
*2. I’m comfortable with a minimal amount of this content*
*3. I’m comfortable with this content, but don’t go overboard*
*4. The more the better*

**Dismemberment, disfigurement, and body horror**
*1. I’d prefer if none of this is included*
*2. I’m comfortable with a minimal amount of this content*
*3. I’m comfortable with this content, but don’t go overboard*
*4. The more the better*

**Isolation, torture, and vulnerability**
*1. I’d prefer if none of this is included*
*2. I’m comfortable with a minimal amount of this content*
*3. I’m comfortable with this content, but don’t go overboard*

              <p>My immediate reaction is there is no neutral option. You jump from “im fine but not too much” to “the more the better.” What about: “I’m absolutely comfortable with whatever you have in mind”? Maybe that’s omitted by design</p>
