    <description>**Emperor Palpatine is dead.** 
![SWS-TheVeil-01|500x500,75%](upload://zF3uyj6ilrehpkKjV3HQBICtHPr.jpeg) 
Moments ago, the Alliance to Restore the Republic destroyed the second and final Death Star over the forest moon of Endor. The Empire is shattering even as you read this on your holoscreen back on Coruscant, the world that was once the Imperial Capital. And who are you? You&#39;re just some cybered-up punk trying to navigate a world in complete turmoil, ducking Coruscant Security, playing the angles with the Corporate sectors, and staying one step ahead of the Black Sun, the Criminal organization trying to take over the HoloNet Relays.

The Veil is a collaborative storytelling game Powered by the Apocalypse designed to tell cyberpunk stories of your own making. Use world-building tools to come up with unique settings that look and feel like the cyberpunk you and your friends have always wanted. Put questions that drive your characters at the heart of heists, mysteries, and conspiracies. Break a futuristic world and then try to put it back together. Play to find out what happens.

-----------------------------------
This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s Return of the Jedi) when the Empire was in control, Jedi were few and hunted, and the rebellion was growing in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries.

There will be 3 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. The sessions will be recorded as Unlisted on my YouTube channel, but will not be shared or released unless all participating players agree.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)) safety tool will be in use.
