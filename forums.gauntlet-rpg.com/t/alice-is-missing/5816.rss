*Alice is Missing*  is a silent role-playing game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town of Silent Falls.

After character creation, the game is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren’t in the same place together.

This is an event style game, so there is only one session.

**Media Touchstones:**   *Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, Firewatch, Searching*

**CONTENT &amp; TRIGGER WARNINGS**

*Alice is Missing* inherently deals with topics of lack of agency, death, grief, helplessness, loss, tense family dynamics, and violence. Player discretion is advised.

**Safety Tool:** X Card, Lines and Veils, Open Door

**Code of Conduct** : All participants agree to abide by the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)

**Technology:** Roll20, Discord, and Zoom. While extensive experience with Roll20 and Discord is not required, it&#39;s recommended players have basic familiarity with these applications. I will send information ahead of the game about how to test your connection and basic operations.

**Recording:** This session will not be recorded.
