    <description>*In this the Year of Our Lord 1701, did end the bloody career of the pirate Captain Jonathan Abraham Pallor, called Brimstone Jack.*
*He did not die on the gallows, nor by the sword, nor shot in two by cannon. He died of poison, administered to him by his cook, an assassin under the King’s orders. This is what happened next...*

*Drag forward the cook, the assassin Tom Reed, throw him to the deck. He’s spitting and proclaiming us dead men all, no captain no more, ship listing and hungry, and His Majesty’s Ship The Resolute even now hauls up its anchor over in Kingston Bay.*

This is for 3 sessions of Poison&#39;d, signing up to all three is recommended but not mandatory - you must RSVP for every session you will attend. Sessions will last for 3.5 hours. Registration opens to all on 21st May at noon (GMT+1)
Please note that the third session (18th July) coincides with the Gauntlet Community Open Gaming Weekend, so please be aware of that when considering your schedule.

We will play over Zoom, and I will record the game, but check in with everyone for consent before publishing. 

**Content Warnings:** 
This game concentrates on brutal violence and produces grim sin-filled pirate stories of vice and backstabbing, and not necessarily the swashbuckling fun usual of the genre.
Your media touchstone is more Black Sails than Pirates of the Carribean. 

Please note (if you&#39;re already familiar with the game) that I am removing the sin of &#39;Rape&#39; from the game, so that even in character generation we will not cross that line.

**Safety Tools:**
We will have the usual Lines &amp; Veils, and in play we will use Script Change and an Open Door.
