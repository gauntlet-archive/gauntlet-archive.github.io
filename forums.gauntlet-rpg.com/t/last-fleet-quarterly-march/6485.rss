This is a run of [Last Fleet](https://blackarmada.com/product/last-fleet/), a PbtA game of the last remnants of humanity fleeing from an implacable alien foe in a ragtag fleet, by [Josh Fox](https://twitter.com/armadajosh) of Black Armada games. Sessions will be three hours in length, and this initial run represents the first month of what I intend to be a quarterly series running the same time and day in April and May as well. Attendance in the first month of play does not constitute a commitment to play in subsequent months of the quarterly, though first refusal will be given to players in March for the following months. This game will be played using the open table policy, and you are more than welcome to sign up even if you cannot make all sessions - though this game will be played with a dedicated Session Zero and I would advise against only signing up for that. Please be aware that clocks change in March and if you are outside of Europe relative start times may be subject to variance.. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (February 8th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants. 

*The last of humanity are fleeing across space, pursued by the implacable inhuman adversary that destroyed their civilisation. They’re outnumbered and outgunned. Supplies are running low. The actions of a brave few could be all that stands between humanity and extinction.*

*Welcome to the **Last Fleet***

Last Fleet takes inspiration from Battlestar Galactica, and for this run I would like to stick quite close in tone and aesthetic to the 2000&#39;s series. We will flesh out more of the universe, our fleet, and the foe that pursues us as part of the initial Session Zero, but I would like BSG to be our key touchstone.

Content Warnings:  This is a game that focuses on military action against a terrible foe, and as such violence and loss are key themes in the game, including death of civilians. A key mechanic of the game focuses around building stress/pressure and often releasing this in destructive ways, as well as a sense of despair. Betrayal and toxic relationships are lucky to be features of the game, as is infiltration by/loss of control to an alien threat. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
