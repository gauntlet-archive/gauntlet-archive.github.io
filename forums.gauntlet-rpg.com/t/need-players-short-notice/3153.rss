    <title>Need Players - Short Notice</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/need-players-short-notice/3153</link>
    <description>Just wanted to clarify something...

There is no area in Forums for Short notice games? Slack channel has Need Players.

Patron $8 tier for Slack - Need Players (short notice games)
                                        AND for RSVP - Calendar.

So you can use Calendar and Forums without the $8 tier,  but not Short notice games.

So the $8 tier allows you to do short notice games and get first pick for calendar games.

IF your life-work schedule is short notice, you HAVE to get $8 tier else you&#39;ve got no chance of getting a game.

This does seem like the haves and have nots, is there no option for a Need Players section of the Forums?</description>
