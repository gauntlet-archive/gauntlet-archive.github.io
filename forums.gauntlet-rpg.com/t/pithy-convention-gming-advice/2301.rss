    <description>As we move into con season, I thought it would be good to pull together some specific, concrete, and tight advice for running at cons. As GMs we can be verbose, so this advice should be kept to one or two sentences at most. Here&#39;s my starter, please add any others you might have:

* While you’re waiting for players to arrive ask first comers about their con experience. Avoid talking about you own, and listen to their conversation.
* If a player mentions something they love about the game before the session starts, try to incorporate that towards the end.
* Tell players the structure of the session right away (cc, break, play, end time)
* If you’re doing at table character creation, tell players they can pick some things on the fly. This helps slower players.
* Use and explain safety tools.
* Take a break or two.
* Have writing implements.
* Demonstrate you’re keeping an eye on time.
* End early so players can make their next session.
* Do epilogues.
* Don’t dawdle.
* In the last 30 minutes hard frame scenes to get to a conclusion.
* Tell players at the start that in the last 30 minutes you may start to hard frame scenes to get to a conclusion.</description>

<p>Establish your phone policy clearly and enforce it during the game (I place mine face-down on the table and ask everyone else to do the same)</p>
<p>For games you’ll run repeatedly, laminate the character sheets or pregens and hand out dry-erase pens for markup. Sheet protectors will pinch hit if needed.</p>
<p>Assume no one will bring dice and pack along as many as you need for the full table to each get what they need to play.</p>
<p>Make sure you can easily tell players the nearest place at the show proper or online to buy/download the game you’re playing.</p>
<p>If you run online or have projects you’re working on, don’t be shy about having a few business/calling cards to hand out to players who want them.</p>

<li>Know generally where help is, from event organizers to security to your friends.</li>
<li>Remember that you are a player too, so make sure you have fun. If you aren’t, say so. If you can’t fix it, stop playing.</li>
<li>Take care of yourself. Stay hydrated. Stay fed.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to delegate. Let them draw the map, or play an NPC, or go track down the thing you forgot. Everybody wants to help.</li>
<li>Beyond safety tools, keep an eye on social dynamics and shut down people being talked over or pushed out of the spotlight by more aggressive or excitable players.</li>
<li>About halfway through, take a break and ask everyone to come back with something they really want to see in the second half, then angle for that stuff to happen.</li>

              <p>As we move into con season, I thought it would be good to pull together some specific, concrete, and tight advice for running at cons. As GMs we can be verbose, so this advice should be kept to one or two sentences at most. Here’s my starter, please add any others you might have:</p>
<ul>
<li>While you’re waiting for players to arrive ask first comers about their con experience. Avoid talking about you own, and listen to their conversation.</li>
<li>If a player mentions something they love about the game before the session starts, try to incorporate that towards the end.</li>
<li>Tell players the structure of the session right away (cc, break, play, end time)</li>
<li>If you’re doing at table character creation, tell players they can pick some things on the fly. This helps slower players.</li>
<li>Use and explain safety tools.</li>
<li>Take a break or two.</li>
<li>Have writing implements.</li>
<li>Demonstrate you’re keeping an eye on time.</li>
<li>End early so players can make their next session.</li>
<li>Do epilogues.</li>
<li>Don’t dawdle.</li>
<li>In the last 30 minutes hard frame scenes to get to a conclusion.</li>
<li>Tell players at the start that in the last 30 minutes you may start to hard frame scenes to get to a conclusion.</li>
</ul>
