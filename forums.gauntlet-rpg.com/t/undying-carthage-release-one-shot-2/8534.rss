    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/undying-carthage-release-one-shot-2/8534</link>
    <description>To celebrate this week’s release, I’m running *another* one-shot on the Gauntlet Calendar for Thursday, Dec 29th 8:30pm AEDT (9:30am GMT).

**All players will receive a free copy. Some set up will be done via slack/email in lead up.**

![Undying_Carthage_Cover](upload://1xTTOlZbtLBXuzIGUb3XYddAEl5)

&gt; *You are a predator: a vampire who stalks human prey in the night, feasting on their blood.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *Blood is life. It’s eating, drinking, breathing, and screwing, all wrapped up in one little, crimson drop. Your thirst for blood is blinding and drinking it – that’s ecstasy. Feeding from prey isn’t just sucking on a juice box; it’s going to a fine restaurant.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *You will go to any length to feed. The craving to do so is ever-present. Even when you swallow your fill of blood, the devil whispers in your ear, tempting you to drink more. Go hungry and the beast takes over. The beast is the relentless beating in your lifeless heart; it craves excess, cruelty, and destruction. Between feast and famine, restraint and recklessness, a predator’s unlife offers more than an eternal, blood-junkie existence. Immortality is the reward that awaits a predator who can balance on the knife edge.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *Predators are the apex: the union of man’s scheming ingenuity and beast’s instinctive ferocity. Though man and lesser creatures are sheep to the wolf, the wolf is among a pack of wolves. And in this pack, the most cunning and ruthless is the alpha. All predators envy that power and prestige. They nip at each other nightly, fighting over the scraps. Each hopes to one night rule the pack. Thus, from the greatest predator to the least, all are embroiled in a ceaseless conflict of intrigue and bloodshed.*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *This is what it means to be a predator. This is Undying.*
