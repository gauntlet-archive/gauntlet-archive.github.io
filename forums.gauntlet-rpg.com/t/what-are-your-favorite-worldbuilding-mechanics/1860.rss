    <description>Hey folks, I’m working on a game that will start and live on collaborative worldbuilding. I don’t want the game world to be created by the GM but shared by all the players, as one of my design goals is to spark interesting conversations around the game world itself, both before the game begins and while the game is being played. (The short pitch of this game is: create your -punk world — whether it&#39;s dronepunk, bookpunk or plantpunk — and play the struggle between the power owning the tech and the punks below).

This, of course, happens in every game in some way but I want to lean in toward the mechanization of worldbuilding, offering players rewards for creating interesting and complicated things in the world for the characters to struggle with. 

I played and saw/heard few games where the world is build on the fly, _Dungeon World_ being the prime example but I&#39;m also thinking of _A Quiet Year_ and _Microscope_. But what else is there? What are your favorite mechanics and techniques for doing worldbuilding at the table?</description>

              <p>I borrowed a lot of things from lots of games and simplified them until I had a bunch of questions I could ask the players to get them to help me build a setting big enough for a one-shot in less than 20 min. I included a few easy to implement premises that could apply anywhere and a few tables to spice thing up.

              <p>I would like to suggest the Kids on Bikes method. It gives about 10 questions about the town like what is the school mascot and what is your town known for and one economic adjective (booming, stagnant, prosperous, etc.).  Pretty nice way to get everyone into the same world.</p>
<p>Personally. I think I will borrow the “give an incentive for each antagonistic item added” idea at the beginning of the game for my western themed gambling mechanical rpg.  I really like this concept in a game run with a gambling mechanism!</p>
<p>I also think every game that doesn’t want to be generic or give dozens of pages of setting should be using the open questions or Ironsworn list or some kind of pseudo random list style of worldbuilding. It just seems SO effective in just the space of a few pages to narrow down the world AND give inspiration.</p>

              <p>In <a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2018/01/the-unbroken-circle/" rel="nofollow noopener">one game I made</a>, you had players create a series of cultural rules and practices, then decided which applied to your character. So you take the Page through King cards from a Tarot deck’s minor arcana, shuffle them and deal them to the players as evenly as possible. Take turns going around the table, putting out a card you were dealt and defining that cultural practice. Each suit and rank had a meaning: Kings were universal laws everyone must follow, Queens were common beliefs that it was unusual (but not unknown) to follow, Knights were contentious political topics, where there was a lot of disagreement about them, and Pages were weird fringe sects and beliefs. Cups were about basic needs of survival: food, shelter, etc. Swords were threats and dangers to the society. Pentacles were magical phenomena, and Wands represented cultural flourishing and personal growth. So you might have the Queen of Cups be “We are vegetarians” and that is true, for the majority of society. Or you might have the Knight of Wands be a contentious issue about religious practice int he society. Once these practices were all defined, you had a good sense of the culture. Each player would build on the previous ones, so you got a cohesive culture.</p>
<p>Then during character creation, you allied yourself with some (but not all) of the cultural practices. Every character followed all the King rank practices. Each player selected 3 Queen rank practices to follow, and one to be opposed to. Then they chose two Knight rank practices to follow and two to oppose, and one Page rank to follow and three to oppose. This led to no character following every part of the culture, but everyone following most of what made that culture meaningful and unique.</p>

              <p>One of the first things I discuss with new group/players is an idea I call Schrodinger’s World.</p>
<p>It boils down to the fact that until something is introduced (examined) in the game, it both exists and does not exist in the setting. Our characters (the “cat inside the box”) “know” which one is true, but we as the players or the GM  (the “scientists looking at the closed box”) don’t until we examine it in game. The idea has a lot in common with <a href="https://www.wizardthieffighter.com/2019/anti-canon-worlds-and-the-uvg/" rel="nofollow noopener">Ultraviolet Grasslands Anti Canon</a>. It helps in changing the traditional RPG idea that GM has all the answers. It is a great preamble for making (especially more traditional) players more confident with creating world details.</p>
<p>Then, leading questions and Jason’s “painting the scene” move are my bread and butter.</p>
<p>For a long fantasy campaign, I once created a “dictionary” (heavily inspired by <a href="http://ageofravens.blogspot.com/2011/09/dreamreading-dictionary-of-mu.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Dictionary of Mu</a> game) where all those new elements would be written up, by the person who introduced it, into a physical book (there was xp for writing and other mechanics that used the book entries). I also used the same mechanic in an occultish pulp game where players were discovering and cataloging the secret world of magic and monsters in our world. You can translate this idea to cyberpunk by using a wiki or just calling the notes an underground database.</p>
<p>Thinking of wiki, you can also check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon_(game)" rel="nofollow noopener">Lexicon</a>, which is about creating a world through encyclopedia/dictionary like entries.</p>
<p>…and as others have said - <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/" rel="nofollow noopener">Microscope</a>, <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/kingdom/" rel="nofollow noopener">Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year" rel="nofollow noopener">The Quiet Year</a> are all great starting points for getting techniques of creating a setting before the game proper.</p>
<p>From me, I can throw some smaller games that can serve as inspiration:</p>

              <p>Another more micro-element that I liked was in a Rogue Trader PbtA hack. Each playbook had a choice of 2-3 “ship features,” and the choice became part of the ship that everyone called home. (Not sure what you did when introducing new PCs.)</p>
<p>I could imagine something like that, where the playbooks each choose a feature of the world. The Captain could decide: airships vs land-tanks vs. leviathan-riders. The Scoundrel could decide if power was held by Nobles or Corporates or Technocrats or whatever. The Hacker could decide if “the network” was Wired or Psychic or Demonic or whatever.</p>
<p>Maybe make that choice the first thing each playbook decides, and do character creation round-robin, instruct everyone to make choices that build on, compliment, and contrast prior choices.</p>
<p>No idea if it’d work. Might be fun to try!</p>

              <p>Maybe more micro-level than you want, but John Wick’s “dirty dungeons” approach is interesting. The players make up what they “know” about the dungeon they’re about to explore, and bank a bennie for each bad thing they introduce. For every X minutes they spend, the GM gets a twist… something that they realize later is no longer true (or wasn’t true, or was misunderstood). Peter J turned this into a move for DW, wrote it up here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19705/dungeon-world-legwork-john-wicks-dirty-dungeons-as-a-basic-move" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19705/dungeon-world-legwork-john-wicks-dirty-dungeons-as-a-basic-move</a></p>
<p>I don’t know how’d you translate that into large-scale world building, but it could apply pretty well as a way to have players generate each score.</p>

<p>To create the system, I basically sat down and asked myself “what are the core elements of cyberpunk? looking at all the different takes on cyberpunk, what is consistent?” Then I asked myself, “Within those elements, what are all the different variations I see in cyberpunk media?”</p>

<p>In terms of player rewards…it seemed like the investment was the main reward people took from it. The players who were drawn to this sort of system liked that they had some narrative control. The other reward was the unique-ness of what the group created. People seemed to like playing in a world that had themes of cyberpunk, but was tailored more to their own experiences and preferences.</p>

              <p>Hey folks, I’m working on a game that will start and live on collaborative worldbuilding. I don’t want the game world to be created by the GM but shared by all the players, as one of my design goals is to spark interesting conversations around the game world itself, both before the game begins and while the game is being played. (The short pitch of this game is: create your -punk world — whether it’s dronepunk, bookpunk or plantpunk — and play the struggle between the power owning the tech and the punks below).</p>
<p>This, of course, happens in every game in some way but I want to lean in toward the mechanization of worldbuilding, offering players rewards for creating interesting and complicated things in the world for the characters to struggle with.</p>
<p>I played and saw/heard few games where the world is build on the fly, <em>Dungeon World</em> being the prime example but I’m also thinking of <em>A Quiet Year</em> and <em>Microscope</em>. But what else is there? What are your favorite mechanics and techniques for doing worldbuilding at the table?</p>
