    <description>Celebrate the unofficial US holiday of Black Friday from the comfort of your own home. Wearing sweatpants is encouraged!

In this single session of Brindlewood Bay, the Mavens&#39; Black Friday deal hunting is interrupted by a disturbance in the Ambergis Galleria. What sinister force could stop the throngs from buying bargains? The Mavens must put away their coupons and pull out their magnifying glasses to untangle the mystery.

The tone of the game is usually light with some dark moments interspersed.

**Content Warning:**  murder, aging, seniors, excessive spending, cults

**Brindlewood Bay**  is a tabletop roleplaying game that combines  *Murder, She Wrote*  with H.P. Lovecraft. In it, you play a group of elderly women, members of the local Murder Mavens Mystery Book Club, who help the authorities solve murder cases in a picturesque New England town. Over the course of their investigations, they become aware of a dark occult conspiracy that connects the cases, and will eventually have to face that conspiracy in order to save their community. 

Story is based on the &quot;Good Buy, Cruel World&quot; scenario by Michael Van Vleet for  **Brindlewood Bay** , with seasonal elements mixed in.

Participants will be sent meeting details and game materials **4 days** prior to session.

**System** : Brindlewood Bay (No prior knowledge of the game is necessary, rules will be taught) Character creation will happen in-session. If you have a favorite Maven from a previous series, you&#39;re welcome to bring her in.

**Duration** : 3.5 Hours (up to 4 hours), Single Session only

**Breaks** : Breaks approximately on the hour, 5-10 minutes each,

**Venue** : Jitsi

**Recording** : No

**Safety** : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, check-ins and open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the group. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
