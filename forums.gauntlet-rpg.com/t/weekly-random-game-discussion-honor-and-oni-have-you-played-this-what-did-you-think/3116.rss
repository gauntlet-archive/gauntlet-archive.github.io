    <description>I will pick a random game from a random rpg search and see if anyone on the Gauntlet has played this game and if what feedback there is about that game.  It seems like a fun way to get opinions on obscure games from the community.  

This week&#39;s entry is...
[Honor and Oni](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/55293/honor-oni) - A samurai take on [Laser &amp; Feelings](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/23290/lasers-feelings) by the esteem John Harper.

Sep.17 - 22
[BESM (Big Eyes Small Mouth) anime rpg](https://rpggeek.com/rpgfamily/327/besm-big-eyes-small-mouth) all versions including d20
Any fans or haters out there?  If so, why?

              <p>As a game there’s just not much there, and what is there isn’t terribly balanced or playable. BUT the sourcebooks for the various series are packed full of episode guides, character overview and world stuff so they’re worth a look if you’re a fan of the property in question. They’d be pretty great guides for hacking.</p>

              <p>Okay.  BESM.  I have read 2nd edition.  It is very old school and not very evocative.  Too generic to tell a specific type of story.  On the other hand, I believe the first edition may have been the first anime themed game to not focus entirely on mecha / kaiju / ninja / or even violence.  I got my copy in a free give away and I quickly passed it on again.</p>
<p>As for the d20 version,…an extra no thank you!  The only real charms to this game are the flexibility and loose mechanics.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think?</p>

              <p>My take: on this week’s entry Frontier</p>
<p>I had a passing interest in this game when it popped up in my random search.</p>
<p><em><strong>From publisher blurb:</strong></em><br>
"<em>Burn, slash, cut, incinerate, shoot, maul, vaporise, maim, slaughter, electrocute, rend, blast and disintegrate your way through  <strong>The Frontier</strong> !</em></p>
<p><em>Inspired by action roleplaying games, such as Borderlands and Destiny,  <strong>The Frontier</strong>  is a sci-fi game of hi-octane action that focuses on the simpler pleasures of life. Explore the alien ruins of a faraway world, fight a ton of nasties and baddies, and collect a boatload of loot as your reward!</em>"</p>
<p><strong>Cool!</strong></p>
<p>*** Create intricate characters with complex personalities, then go shoot bad guys in the face and take their stuff!*<br>
** An exciting post-apocalyptic setting, complete with an introductory scenario to get you straight into the action. The game’s setting is completely optional and easily replaced by your own creation.*</p>
<p>Sounds like a setting split between <strong>Apocalypse World</strong> meets <strong>Durance</strong>"!<br>
<strong>Really cool!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A simple game system with old school sensibilities to keep things moving at a smooth pace. If you’ve ever played a d20-based game, you already know how to play!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ah…hmmm.  Maybe?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guns, guns, guns! A multitude of unique weapons and armor, each with several different randomly-determined variants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ugh.  Nevermind…I don’t want a game focused on how much damage a million weapons do…</strong>  Still, I have never tried it.  Maybe it’s great?  Well…probably not.  If you have tried this game, let me know.</p>
