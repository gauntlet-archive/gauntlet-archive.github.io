Please only sign up for this game if you&#39;re okay with helping playtest this newer version of the game! I will send an email a week in advance of the first session to confirm attendance.

We were once the heroes of this galaxy. We stood against the tide of darkness and prevailed, again and again. We were comrades, we were family. But our family fell apart. Our shared past is full of shame, trespasses, and secrets. We parted ways, vowing to never see each other again.

And now, our greatest enemy has returned. Manipulating from the shadows, they grow stronger than ever. No one else believes the threat is real. Only the Captain has a chance at defeating this enemy, once and for all.

The Captain will have to bring the crew back together again. But will they go with them into the void once more? Can the crew trust the Captain again, who left disappointment and heartbreak in their wake? Will they survive the suicide mission to save the galaxy? We play to find out.

**Touchstones:** Mass Effect 2, Star Trek: Picard.

**CW: war, possible themes of death, romance. This game deals directly with strong and difficult emotions such as guilt, anger, etc. One of the players must play as the Captain, who most likely wronged every other crew member. Character death is highly possible.**

**System** : [Once More Into The Void](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/once-more-into-the-void) is based on the [Firebrands](https://lumpley.itch.io/firebrands) structure, it&#39;s prompt based with very few rules and lots of opportunities to roleplay. Rules will be taught in play.

**Duration**  : Four 2.5 hour sessions

**Breaks**  : 2 breaks per session (5-10 mins)

**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom

**Recording**  : Yes, but only if all players consent to recording and publishing

**Attendance**  : Joining all sessions is ideal but not required **.**

**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, Script Change, an open door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players.

**Open access** : Public signs up for those without early RSVP access are available at 3/25/2021 10PM (Manila Time)
