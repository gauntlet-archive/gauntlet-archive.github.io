    <description>For my 5-year Gauntletversary...

&gt; *...as a child, when your mom would drive past a cemetery. “You gotta hold your breath,” other kids would tease, “or else the ghosts will get you. They&#39;ll get into your chest and possess you!” But the way you heard it, as soon as you passed a white house, you could breathe safe again.*
&gt; *So dutifully you would hold your breath, watching the stones drift by, until you reached the safe house. Then you grew up, and you did not hold your breath anymore.*
&gt; *It doesn&#39;t feel so childish now.* 

Everyone is dead. Everyone. It happened all at once, overnight, while you slept. Everyone simply
stopped breathing. You can&#39;t account for it. You don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s just you and a handful of
others who yet live.

But the spirits of the dead are still wandering the world. They are wondering if you&#39;d care to join them. They are watching you with bated breath. They wait.

You and these others are all that remains. You must arm yourselves, you must keep each other strong, and you must find that safe white house. Because until you do, you will not breathe easy again.

Tread carefully.

Bated Breath is a horror story game that uses Google Maps&#39; Street View as a setting and exploration tool.
