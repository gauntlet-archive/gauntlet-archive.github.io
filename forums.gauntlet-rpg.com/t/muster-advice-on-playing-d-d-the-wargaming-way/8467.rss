    <title>Muster - Advice on playing D&amp;D the wargaming way</title>

    <description>Eero Tuovinen has finally finished writing ***Muster - A Primer for War. Advice for playing D&amp;D the wargaming way***! I excitedly [reported on the project in an earlier thread](https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/muster-a-new-old-school-primer/6188/3).

It is [now available **for free** at DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/413382/Muster?affiliate_id=197393).

(It&#39;s technically pay-what-you-want so you can tip him, but he&#39;s made it clear at DriveThruRPG and elsewhere that it&#39;s free and free to share.)

It&#39;s taken longer than anticipated, but it&#39;s also grown from it&#39;s early estimated length of 50 pages to 250+ pages! Fortunately, (1) there&#39;s **a brief manifesto at the beginning** and (2) it&#39;s been **split into a basic and advanced section** .

I think it&#39;s a stellar piece of work, providing both **practical advice for storygamers new to this style of play** and **theoretical observations and surprises for RPG aficionados** in general.

Among other things, Eero offers a mature take on **Chauvinism and D&amp;D** and penetrating observations about **&#39;The Nihilistic Void&#39;** encroaching on long-term campaigns conducted in the wargaming way --- but **judge for yourself**!</description>

              <p>I haven’t read the Muster yet, but I have followed its development, and it’s a real master class in a particular way of engaging with old school D&amp;D and similar games. I’ve been running a campaign in this style and it’s refreshing, different, and exciting. Quite the experience, if you’ve never tried it!</p>
<p>Eero is a very intelligent and articulate writer and his content here is informed by quite literally thousands of hours of play. Glad to see this finally complete and out in the world!</p>
