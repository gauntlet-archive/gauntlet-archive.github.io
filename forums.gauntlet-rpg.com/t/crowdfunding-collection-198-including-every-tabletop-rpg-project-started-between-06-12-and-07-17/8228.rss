    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2022/07/18/crowdfunding-collection-198/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #198, including every tabletop rpg project started between 06/12 and 07/17&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The collections covers a bit more than a months because I had two weeks of vacation and because Kickstarters „bot protection“ managed to kill my will (and ability) to do it for a while as I couldn’t do the searches or open the projects. I found a work around, which makes the compilation take longer, and acquired the energy required and thus am back…
