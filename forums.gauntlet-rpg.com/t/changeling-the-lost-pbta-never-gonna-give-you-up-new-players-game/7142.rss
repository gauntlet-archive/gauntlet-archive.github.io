    <title>Changeling the Lost PbtA: Never Gonna Give You Up (New Players Game)</title>

    <description># **For the first 48 hours please only sign up if you have a) joined the Gauntlet since March and b) haven’t yet played a regular Calendar game with me (so not including GCOG sessions).**

This is for five sessions of *Changeling the Lost: PbtA* on Tuesday evenings in August (US Eastern), a game about escaped supernatural beings caught up in a world which has moved on past them. You were taken into the Hedge, changed by your Keeper, and somehow managed to escape and find your Motley, a kind of family. In session one we will also set tone and safety, take about our city and freehold, make characters, establish the nature of our motley, and get playing.

Rules will be taught. Attendance at all sessions is strongly encouraged. One seat is being reserved.

***Content warning:***  trauma, PTSD, horror, controlling relationships, family divisions.

This is a hack of *Changeling the Lost* using PbtA to focus on the elements I dig about the setting. This is a work in progress, rough and messy but definitely playable. It borrows from *Hearts of Wulin*, *Urban Shadows*, *The Veil*, and more.

We will use Zoom for our sessions. I’ll email all players about a week before the first session with the necessary links. Sessions will run up to three hours. We will plan to record, but I will confirm this with the players. The [Gauntlet Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and we will use Lines &amp; Veils and the X-Card for safety tools.

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
