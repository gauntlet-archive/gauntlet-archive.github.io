<p>February introduces the Zine Quest 2 Kickstarter event, which follows a very productive week in regards to projects started. Thus there are a total of 79 projects, about 26 offering new games. To make it a bit more accessible, I decided to split the collection.<br>
<a href="https://teylen.blog/2020/02/02/crowdfunding-collection-132-part-1-of-2/" rel="nofollow noopener">Do take a look at part 1!</a></p>
<p>In this part I will focus on all the many Zine projects.<br>
<b>Rain on a Conga Drum</b> shows that something as small as a zine can contain not one, not two but three games! The games are all inspired by the musician Van Zandt, who appears to be a country singer or well songwriter. The approach intruiges me and I feel tempted. In <b>Beak, Feather, &amp; Bone</b> the player play crow like creatures and essentially build a world or rather map, including notations. The illustrations look cool and the approach to make world-building fun sounds enticing. Though, you might be looking for a solo game experience, in which case, take a look at the <b>The Artefact</b>. The game has you creating an artifact and see where it goes and what is done with it…<br>
<b>Palanquin</b> is more a traditional fantasy game. The player character happens to be the heir to a dynasty, when a coupe happens and puts them in danger as well as sees them fleeing. Basically like Ciri in The Witcher (I imagine). I do trust Jason Pitre, the designer, and ton and might back it. Then there’s <b>BUTCHERY</b>, where the characters have to face monsters that were created by the actions of humans and restore harmony in nature. I think of it as maybe being a bit like Werewolf The Apocalypse. Without the bloat or shapeshangers. The setting is described as licorice fantasy (dark, bitter but not all tears and misery), which is quite a unique description (I like salty licorice). I might back it and recommend having a look at the game. With <b>Corsairs</b> you’ll get more lofty, airborn fantasy. Sailing around in flying ships with floating islands. Which sounds nicte. Well, and then there’s <b>No Stone Unturned</b>. Where you may explore a fantasy world and build a homebase. With the option to peak into the system via the SRD. Rarely did I like that many „normal“ fantasy game.<br>
If you rather play a mundane band, checkout <b>ROCK &amp; ROLL</b>. With Rock’n’Roll being something that might provide a good soundtrack to some <b>Derby Drama</b>. Both games do look solid.<br>
Though maybe you like your mundane and urban game with some fantasy <b>A Touch of Glamour</b> has you covered with playing fae creatures. Alternatively you might descend into a the <b>Green Dawn Mall</b> to get one of your pals out of the maze. Well or you’re a gay dishwasher, greeter in the <b>Dish Pit Witches</b>. Which sounds like a quite unique idea.<br>
There’s the option that you prefer science fiction. Where I would recommend to you having a look at <b>Moonsailors</b>. Traversing space, making discovery… the game focuses on the solitary experience and the connectivness, being accessible for groups of 3 to 5 players. Then there’s <b>VALOR KNIGHTS: THE ELECTROCUBE WAR</b> which looks more like fun cartoon syfy, Which is a nice change.<br>
There are plenty more cool zines. Settings like <b>Willow</b>, supplements like <b>On the Shoulders of Colossus</b> or <b>Dead Halt – Happy New Year 1999</b> as well as adventures like <b>Sinister Red</b> (full of vampires).<br>
You’ll find all those projects – and more – listed here:</p>
