    <description>I present to you the &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/02/crowdfunding-collection-132-part-2-of-2-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;new Crowdfunding Collection #132 – Part 2 of 2, including every tabletop rpg project started between 01/26 and 02/02&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

February introduces the Zine Quest 2 Kickstarter event, which follows a very productive week in regards to projects started. Thus there are a total of 79 projects, about 26 offering new games. To make it a bit more accessible, I decided to split the collection.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/02/crowdfunding-collection-132-part-1-of-2/&quot;&gt;Do take a look at part 1!&lt;/a&gt;

In this part I will focus on all the many Zine projects.
&lt;b&gt;Rain on a Conga Drum&lt;/b&gt; shows that something as small as a zine can contain not one, not two but three games! The games are all inspired by the musician Van Zandt, who appears to be a country singer or well songwriter. The approach intruiges me and I feel tempted. In &lt;b&gt;Beak, Feather, &amp; Bone&lt;/b&gt; the player play crow like creatures and essentially build a world or rather map, including notations. The illustrations look cool and the approach to make world-building fun sounds enticing. Though, you might be looking for a solo game experience, in which case, take a look at the &lt;b&gt;The Artefact&lt;/b&gt;. The game has you creating an artifact and see where it goes and what is done with it..
&lt;b&gt;Palanquin&lt;/b&gt; is more a traditional fantasy game. The player character happens to be the heir to a dynasty, when a coupe happens and puts them in danger as well as sees them fleeing. Basically like Ciri in The Witcher (I imagine). I do trust Jason Pitre, the designer, and ton and might back it. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;BUTCHERY&lt;/b&gt;, where the characters have to face monsters that were created by the actions of humans and restore harmony in nature. I think of it as maybe being a bit like Werewolf The Apocalypse. Without the bloat or shapeshangers. The setting is described as licorice fantasy (dark, bitter but not all tears and misery), which is quite a unique description (I like salty licorice). I might back it and recommend having a look at the game. With &lt;b&gt;Corsairs&lt;/b&gt; you’ll get more lofty, airborn fantasy. Sailing around in flying ships with floating islands. Which sounds nicte. Well, and then there’s &lt;b&gt;No Stone Unturned&lt;/b&gt;. Where you may explore a fantasy world and build a homebase. With the option to peak into the system via the SRD. Rarely did I like that many „normal“ fantasy game.
If you rather play a mundane band, checkout &lt;b&gt;ROCK &amp; ROLL&lt;/b&gt;. With Rock’n’Roll being something that might provide a good soundtrack to some &lt;b&gt;Derby Drama&lt;/b&gt;. Both games do look solid.
Though maybe you like your mundane and urban game with some fantasy &lt;b&gt;A Touch of Glamour&lt;/b&gt; has you covered with playing fae creatures. Alternatively you might descend into a the &lt;b&gt;Green Dawn Mall&lt;/b&gt; to get one of your pals out of the maze. Well or you’re a gay dishwasher, greeter in the &lt;b&gt;Dish Pit Witches&lt;/b&gt;. Which sounds like a quite unique idea.
There’s the option that you prefer science fiction. Where I would recommend to you having a look at &lt;b&gt;Moonsailors&lt;/b&gt;. Traversing space, making discovery… the game focuses on the solitary experience and the connectivness, being accessible for groups of 3 to 5 players. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;VALOR KNIGHTS: THE ELECTROCUBE WAR&lt;/b&gt; which looks more like fun cartoon syfy, Which is a nice change.
There are plenty more cool zines. Settings like &lt;b&gt;Willow&lt;/b&gt;, supplements like &lt;b&gt;On the Shoulders of Colossus&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Dead Halt – Happy New Year 1999&lt;/b&gt; as well as adventures like &lt;b&gt;Sinister Red&lt;/b&gt; (full of vampires).
You’ll find all those projects – and more – listed here:
