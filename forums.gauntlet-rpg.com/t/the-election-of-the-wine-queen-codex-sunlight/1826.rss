    <title>The Election of the Wine Queen (Codex Sunlight)</title>

    <description>I&#39;m offering a session of The Election of the Wine Queen, published in Codex Sunlight. 

The players play promising candidates and the jury of a traditional German rural wine queen election. Who will be the next wine queen representing the region for year on national fairs? How will this year’s competition change the village to the better – or the worse?

This is a laog, a live action online game. That means we stay fully in-character in the scenes. But like in a black box larp, we plan and discuss scenes beforehand. 

In the game, the consumption of wine is essential. You should have wine or a replacement for wine with you for playing since you have to toast to other players and drinking. More about alcohol and gaming and safety mattes around drinking can be found in the game text. 

You will also need to be able to play a song from another device at any time in the game. The mp3 will be provided to you. 

The tone we are aiming for is one of a dramatic and serious note. There possibly will be larger-than-life and comedic elements but the tragedy of the events to unfold will always draw the tone back to the fact that the tradition celebrated here is dying as are the regions and their pride slowly decaying. We play this game with full respect towards the people and traditions in real life who have inspired the story and we will also pay respect to our characters by portraying them honestly and with an open mind. 

No preparation from your side is necessary. 

Feel free to get in touch with me on the Gauntlet Forums or Slack if you have any questions. 

This event is scheduled to run for 4 hours. It will be recorded and published on my Youtube channel if no objections after the recording are made but I would appreciate if we could publish the session. 

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools will be explained and practiced before we start actual play.
