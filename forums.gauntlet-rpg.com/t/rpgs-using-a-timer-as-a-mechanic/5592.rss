    <title>RPGs using a timer as a mechanic?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/rpgs-using-a-timer-as-a-mechanic/5592</link>
    <description>Given the variety of clever game mechanics around, I was wondering whether there are any games that use a timer as a mechanical component? I&#39;ve not heard of it being done but it feels like the kind of thing that would turn up on small or experimental games that would probably have passed me by- does anyone know any games like this? I was brainstorming a few ideas with a couple of friends and it got me to thinking about how something like this might work and whether it would be fun or frustrating in practice.</description>

<p>Curiously, this thread inspired me to a very similar idea for a 24hr rpg supplement contest on <a href="http://rpggeek.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rpggeek.com</a>.  It’s pretty much like this for Mothership.  Characters start outside in space, tethered to the ship, disoriented.  They have about 30 minutes to solve the crisis / puzzle OR to get to the time travel machine AND get back out of the ship to try again (because the time travel machine pulses massive short distance radiation), otherwise they will take a very large amount of damage.   I think by explaining the dire consequences upfront, it could add real tension.</p>

              <p>What do you mean with an actual timer? A stopwatch, or just a pacing mechanism?</p>
<p>If it’s just measuring the time, I come to think of games like <strong>Puppetland</strong>, where it’s stated in the rules that the game ends after an hour.</p>
<p>I’ve come across a Swedish game (<strong>Starchallenge</strong>) where you had to spin a d10 and decide what to do before it stops spinning.</p>
<p>Another Swedish game (<strong>Västmark</strong>) had the magic execute as soon as the player were done fiddling with the magic rules. So the wizard declared that she wanted to cast a spell, and had to look up the rules while the other players continued with their turns.</p>
<p>We got clocks (as a pacing mechanism) in all the Powered by the Apocalypse games, or rolling to gain Franchise Dice in <strong>InSpectres</strong>, where the game master set a limit, on beforehand, of how many FD the players need to earn before the session ends.</p>
<p>Hit points is a kind of pacing mechanism. Low hit point results in the combat ending faster, compared to having lots of hit points in the same system.</p>

              <p>every game played at a convention…snare drum please <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  It’s a pretty cool idea though.<br>
Certainly there are a ton of games that use PbtA clocks nowadays.  Not so many that use a real timer.  I played use a timer in a D&amp;D 1e style game to solve a puzzle before the trap killed us.  That was fun.  I think if I ran it, players with smarter characters would get a little headstart and lowered characters with a lower Inteligence or equivalency would get less time.</p>
<p>Added:  Come to think of it, I have a dungeon crawl themed board game 5 minute dungeon which as the title suggests gives you 5 miinutes to play enough damage / and protection cards to beat the baddie on each level.  It’s pretty manic fun.  I kind of like the idea of combat rounds being timed with the rest of an rpg being slow played.</p>
<p>Nice! A like from CrudelyDrawnSwords. I enjoy your podcast!</p>

              <p>Some other examples:<br>
“Our Mundane Supernatural Life” by the storybrewers has exactly d4 + 1 minute long scenes.<br>
“Community Radio” by Quinn Murphy alternates between an untimed host and timed slice-of-life scenes to get a radio show vibe.<br>
“Tumbling” by Sydney Icarus has an explicit design goal of a game taking less time than a load of laundry.</p>

              <p>The game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/huntersbooks/alice-is-missing-a-silent-role-playing-game/description" rel="nofollow noopener">Alice is Missing</a>, which recently finished its kickstarter, uses a timer. As I understand it, you flip cards that give clues and suspects at predetermined times.</p>
<p>From the kickstarter game description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the timer starts and the game begins, you’ll flip your Clue Card when the number on the timer hits the number on the Clue Card’s back. This will often result in you drawing a card from the Suspect or Location deck and combining it with the prompt on the Clue Card to create the information your character uncovers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this moment that’s the only game I’m aware of that has a timer built into the game.</p>

              <p>Given the variety of clever game mechanics around, I was wondering whether there are any games that use a timer as a mechanical component? I’ve not heard of it being done but it feels like the kind of thing that would turn up on small or experimental games that would probably have passed me by- does anyone know any games like this? I was brainstorming a few ideas with a couple of friends and it got me to thinking about how something like this might work and whether it would be fun or frustrating in practice.</p>
