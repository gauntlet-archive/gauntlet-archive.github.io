    <description>***I had to cancel this when I put it on the calendar last year, so I’m offering priority sign-ups for people who missed out then. For the first 24 hours, please only sign up if you were signed up for the earlier game.***

***One spot in the game is saved for Andrea.***

The Girlfriend Of My Girlfriend Is My Friend is a diceless game “about the magical, hilarious disaster of being trans and a young adult”. It is a variously intense and low-key slice of life game about young adult drama that features the most incredible selection of playbooks, including The Trans Girl Who’s Really Into Architecture, The Werewolf Who I Smoked With That One Time Who Is Really Cool Actually, Those Two Goths, and more. I am honestly just so obsessed with the game’s voice, it’s really vibrant and sharp and hilarious in ways I don’t think I’ve seen before.

This game is largely lighthearted but can include heavier themes, including transphobia and other kinds of oppression, suicidal ideation, and includes references to sex and drug use. We’ll use lines and veils, the X card and the open door as safety tools, and we’ll play using the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct. 

We’ll be playing over Zoom, with short breaks on the hour. I’ll send an email about a week before the first session to share play materials, confirm attendance, etc. I don’t intend to record these sessions. 

All access time for sign ups is 7pm 28/2/22 AEDT.
