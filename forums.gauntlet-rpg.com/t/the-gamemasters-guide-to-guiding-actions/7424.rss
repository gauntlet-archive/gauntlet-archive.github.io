    <title>The Gamemaster&#39;s Guide to Guiding Actions</title>

    <description>Hi fellow GMs and game designers, 
The term Guiding Actions is common in Israeli Roleplaying circles. I like to think of it as Jedi mind tricks for gameasters. It refers to actions that may not be considered part of the rules but greatly affect the gaming experience.
I created a practical guide for game master&#39;s with 29 guiding actions. Complete with description, explanations, tips and examples. The guide is divided into 8 segments: influencing players decisions, creating anticipation, player driven descriptions, building tension, enhancing the physical space, encourage immersion, breaking the game structure.
Players can enjoy this guide but it is primarily meant for GMs.
Apart from hype, I would love to hear people&#39;s feedback. there is an extended preview if you&#39;re not interested in purchasing it.
