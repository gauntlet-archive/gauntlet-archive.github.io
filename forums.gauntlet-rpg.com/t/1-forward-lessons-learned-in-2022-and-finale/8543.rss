    <description>https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/1-forward/final-episode-lessons-learned-in-2022

It&#39;s a super-sized episode as Rach and Rich talk about the lessons they learned playing and running PbtA games in 2022, and we bring the podcast to a close.

Timecodes:
0:01:23 - Read a Sitch about 2022 gaming highlights
0:35:14 - Open Your Brain to our stray thoughts about PbtA games and play
0:52:08 - Act Under Fire - our closing thoughts

You can find Rach on Mastodon (it&#39;s a social media site - google it!) She&#39;s @teddog@dice.camp
You can find Rich on Mastodon, too. He&#39;s @orklord@dice.camp

Thanks so much to all of our wonderful guests over the years! Thanks to you, our listeners, too. Happy Holiday and Happy New Year!</description>
