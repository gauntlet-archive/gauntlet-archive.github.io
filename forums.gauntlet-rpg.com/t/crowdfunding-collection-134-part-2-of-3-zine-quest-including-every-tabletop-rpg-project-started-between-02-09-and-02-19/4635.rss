    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-2-of-3-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 2 of 3 – Zine Quest, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/09 and 02/19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Following my operation this collection is a bit delayed, and thanks to the zine quest it totals more than 150 projects of whom more than 70 are actual games. Thus I decided to split the collection in three parts, the other two being:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-1-of-3/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 1 of 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2020/02/21/crowdfunding-collection-134-part-3-of-3-zine-quest/&quot;&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #134 – Part 3 of 3 – Zine Quest&lt;/a&gt;

The Zine Quest brought up an astounding amount of new, whole tabletop rpg games, thus lets get to them. The &lt;b&gt;Dirt RPG&lt;/b&gt; offers a fantasy setting after an apocalypse with a quite interesting d6 system. The description is interesting and it looks are quite intruiging. You’ll find another kind of post-apocalypse in &lt;b&gt;Snake People&lt;/b&gt;. I consider the narrative game quite interesting, despite the inherent strangeness of snakes. Well, and if you are fascinated by the mechanics of „snake eye“ rolls, the &lt;b&gt;Snakeyes Gaming System&lt;/b&gt; has you covered.
Maybe you like to have a game in the style of the Westworld series, along with a dashing dose of the Great Gatsbys charme? I certainly do and did back &lt;b&gt;The Gaslight Club&lt;/b&gt;, which is powered by a Blades in the Dark inspired system. If you prefer the series Love Boat, you’ll got to take a cruise with the &lt;b&gt;The Love Ballon&lt;/b&gt;. A gm-less game thats basically steered cooperatively. Well, or you want to play a game of pranking people, in which &lt;b&gt;Funny Freakout&lt;/b&gt; has been Forged in the Dark for you.
There is of course always the option for some Fantasy games. Like creating magical cities in &lt;b&gt;i’m sorry did you say street magic&lt;/b&gt; – that’s create them and explore them. In your prefered genre, vignette or campaign style and without a GM. You don’t need a GM for &lt;b&gt;ALL SKATE FANTASY&lt;/b&gt; either, but get normal heroic fantasy for „party people“. Which I take means that it is lighthearted. For a fun, fast game you should check out &lt;b&gt;Dump Quest&lt;/b&gt;. Creating your game with some „ad-libbing“ fun and maybe destroying the zine in the process.
Horror? Would be the ad-libbed word that covers the next three games. If are enticed by the deep sea horror of William Hope Hodgsons &lt;b&gt;Grey Seas Are Dreaming Of My Death&lt;/b&gt; should be right up your ally for a fatal oneshot. You might prefer to be a monster, as &lt;b&gt;THEY FEED ON FEAR&lt;/b&gt; presents. Following the title you’ll have to instill fear in others to feed. Which is done with quite some style! Though I wouldn’t say &lt;b&gt;DON’T LOOK&lt;/b&gt;. Which is a game in which characters actually have to have fear to survive. Though maxing the fear by looking at the stuff appears to be a bad idea.
I can’t say that &lt;b&gt;Corruption of the Black-Hearted&lt;/b&gt; isn’t horror. As you play people who try to be heroes yet might just go one step to far and become monstrous. An interesting idea for an OSR game that I do consider a bit meta. Though &lt;b&gt;Disk Horse#1: Off to the Races&lt;/b&gt; is definitively more meta’er. As you’ll be playing a PbtA style tabletop rpg game about creating tabletop rpgs. Which I find very difficult to kinda grasp. Well and the most meta-test game is &lt;b&gt;In Our Own Wor(l)ds&lt;/b&gt;. Which addresses the fascination, creation and exchange of game zines as a zine. Yikes, quite a braintwist.
For the Honor is rather straight forward. Looks like She-Ra, got half of She-Ras slogan, colorful as She-Ra and saying it’s inspired by She-Ra. The gm-less game is right up my ally. As is Princess World which too takes inspiration from the She-Ra series and you’ll play cool &amp; competent princesses.
If that’s to much color, maybe get back to the cold of space where noone hears you scream or chant like in &lt;b&gt;INVOCCULTAS – Conduits of the Void&lt;/b&gt;. In which space cultist call upon the eldritch gods in a interestingly card based game. &lt;b&gt;YourVerse&lt;/b&gt; on the other hand rather enables you to create your own science fiction setting while &lt;b&gt;Terranary&lt;/b&gt; sees you struggling human, intergalactic intruiges for which it provides a d12 system. Maybe your more up for a solo experience, that might be played with others but doesn’t have to, in which case you should check out the &lt;b&gt;Science Vessel of Dr. Uaerom&lt;/b&gt;.
Your character vessel of choice might be an animal. Where &lt;b&gt;Winter Harvest&lt;/b&gt; offers you the role of animals who trying to build a home, community and live their lifes. It could be that last collections pigeon game didn’t fill your needs for the airborne raths where &lt;b&gt;Dirty Town&lt;/b&gt; has you covered. Well, and from rats to rodents to vermin, you should check out &lt;b&gt;Hivesworn: Queensfall&lt;/b&gt; if insects are your calling.
There is always the option to have some normal, nice Urban Fantasy. Where I would like to recommend &lt;b&gt;Draculola&lt;/b&gt; with a passion! The game from Austria is addressed to kids – and those who feel like playing a lighthearted game – in which players assume the roles of vampires and other „monsters“. Just that the monsters ain’t evil but do try to make the world a better place. I personally grew up on tv series like „The little Vampire“ and love the genre, which had be back the project in a minute. It’s really cool and cute. Take a look. It’s a heartwarming game somewhat reminiscent of the likes of „Golden Sky Stories“. If you like more mundane Urban Fantasy directed towards older gamers, check out the &lt;b&gt;Mundane Lost&lt;/b&gt;. Which combines the Stepford Wives with Outer Limits and a dash of Forbidden Zone to form an interesting small PbtA game set in a kinda 50s. Then there’s &lt;b&gt;Heaven Has No Taste; And Other True Statements&lt;/b&gt; which will put you in the role of angles and demons on earth in romantical entanglements. Basically providing the plot of a standard CW-series.
Maybe you are more of the opinion „A game within like 30 to 60 zine pages? ONLY one? How can that be?!“. In which case &lt;b&gt;StoryHunter Alphas&lt;/b&gt; gets you 4 games with changing gm’s, you can get three different solo experiences in &lt;b&gt;Alone On A Journey&lt;/b&gt; or 7 short poem based games in &lt;b&gt;Sedentary Dances&lt;/b&gt;. Maybe two are fine with &lt;b&gt;This Thing We Started/The Brokenhearted&lt;/b&gt;? Who knows.
There are many, many more projects. Like the &lt;b&gt;Light of the Setting Sun&lt;/b&gt; Western Setting, &lt;b&gt;Artifices, Deceptions &amp; Dilemmas&lt;/b&gt; to integrate exactly those into your games or system supplements like &lt;b&gt;The Era Zone 2020&lt;/b&gt;.
You’ll find fhose and many more project here:
