*She’s young, single and about to achieve her dream of creating incredible videogames. But then life throws her a one-two punch: a popular streamer gives her first game a scathing review. Even worse she finds out that same troublesome critic is now her new neighbor! A funny, sexy and all-too-real story about gaming, memes, and social anxiety. Come for the plot, stay for the doggo.* 

That&#39;s the premise of &#39;Let&#39;s Play&#39; a popular webcomic on Webtoon. I fell in love with the strip and, with it being on hiatus for good few months, am looking to release a fangame ttrpg to share with other fans so they can have a little fun playing &#39;What if...&#39; As a romance webcomic, I&#39;ve based the game on GxB as it has a very simple structure and very light rules. I&#39;m hoping that a few fans will pick it up and get a taste of roleplaying.

This is a structured freeform game; very simply the main character, Sam, goes on dates (or at least spends time with) her romantic interests and she&#39;ll have a few opportunities on each date to become more intimate with the other. At the end, there&#39;s a simple mechanic to determine which character has captured her heart and they&#39;ll decide whether they and Sam have a future together. Incorporate an aspect from the comic, the players whose characters are not on the &#39;date&#39; at any one time play the emotions of the characters who are and so everyone collaborates together to build up the character of Sam as well as those romancing her.

You can read [the playtest version of the rules here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_0IQay8oR0TETS8Sahv2YInYvMiM2Dx3KeHm6S_Weo/edit?usp=sharing).

You do not need to have any prior knowledge of the webcomic as I&#39;ll describe all the available characters at the start.

Note that, while the attached image shows Sam with her three main romantic interests from the comic, there are many other characters available and I am supportive of Sam being romanced by characters of any gender.

**Technical details**

Note that this game will be played over streamyard and the audio (not the video) may be used to make an actual play to promote the game. I am happy to make edits at players&#39; request though.

**Content warnings &amp; Safety tools**

In reflecting certain aspects of the webcomic, this game includes themes of mental health and mental health conditions. Players will be asked to portray emote-kuns (personifications of character’s emotions).

This sessions will use:

- a content &#39;palette&#39; incorporating Lines &amp; Veils

- Brie Beau Sheldon&#39;s [Script Change toolbox ](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/)plus a &quot;prompt&quot; tool

- active check-ins where requested

These session will follow The Gauntlet’s Code of Conduct.
