    <description>[The Gourmand](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWqwXA5rP_0e6DS3IXjbUCXyPF8zCCmG/view?usp=sharing)

I&#39;m going for a mix between Tonio Trendy from JoJo part 4 and Quina from Final Fantasy 9. Also, I tried to make the Gourmand&#39;s moves kind of a quest of their own, with them always looking for superior monster meat or greater stranger Gourmands to learn from.

Anyway, hope you like it.</description>

              <p>Wow, thanks! That means a whole lot. Also, kinda cool and humbling to see all these good cooking classes.</p>
<p>If you’re interested (and I hope this doesn’t come across as crass or grasping) I have this and a couple other Dungeon World bits on DriveThruRPG. Half are pay what you want so <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/16184/Owlbear-Culture" rel="nofollow noopener">feel free to browse.</a></p>

              <p>Hiya! I’m actually the designer for The Cook playbook linked earlier in this thread! Super humbled to see it here so huge thanks for mentioning it <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/heartbeat.png?v=9" title=":heartbeat:" class="emoji" alt=":heartbeat:"> I’ve since made an itchio and a few changes to the playbook itself (<a href="https://tolinky.itch.io/the-cook" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tolinky.itch.io/the-cook</a>)</p>
<p>You may be surprised to know that I actually ran into another in progress chef playbook while getting feedback on my one (<a href="https://www.notion.so/zackeys/The-Battlechef-Alpha-b7e0c000cfdd4726bc427e050324aea7" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.notion.so/zackeys/The-Battlechef-Alpha-b7e0c000cfdd4726bc427e050324aea7</a> by Dristan in the Waypoint discord). There must be something particularly delicious in the Dungeon this season that’s been inspiring folks. I’ll say as well that I think having another take on this will be fantastic. There was a lot of very broad ideas I had for my playbook (chef battles, running a resturaunt, cannibalism, rolling recipes on tables, etc etc) that I threw out for the sake of focus and being able to fit the thing on a page. If there can be dozens of distinct playbooks about fighting and dozens about magic I’m sure there’s more than one way to skin a dire rat when it comes to cooking.</p>
<p>In regards to feedback I love love love the idea of having different schools/cultures of cuisine and I like your use of non-stat based buffs (e.g. being able to locate people who have eaten your cuisine). Also your names are brilliant. Only improvement I can think of is that you should slap a price tag on this because it’s good enough to sell.</p>

              <p>I tried to read it but had to nope out at the cannibalism. That’s a thing that gets X-Carded pretty regularly, and I can’t help but think there’s a less obvious and more intriguing choice there, like perhaps stealing recipes and passing them off as yours.</p>
