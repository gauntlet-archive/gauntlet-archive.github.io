    <title>Procedures going at cross-desire</title>

    <description>Hello, 
Provided you&#39;re with a group where trust and a common love for theme-setting are established, how can rules and procedure go insidiously at cross purpose with the players&#39; desires?
I see being unclear on who says what over what and when as the main factor for me. Lowering fictional stakes maybe. Do you see more love breakers?</description>

              <p>OK let’s say prior to play you have trust and safety workshops. Then everybody chooses unanimously to play a cozy farm animal.<br>
What could go wrong?<br>
The question in itself appears simple to me but the scope is wide.</p>
<p>I have two leads : distribution of speech and responsibilities, and lack of drive.</p>
