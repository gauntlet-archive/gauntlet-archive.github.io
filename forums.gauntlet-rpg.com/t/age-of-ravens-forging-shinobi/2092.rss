    <description>![NSV%20Banner%20copy|690x258](upload://aS4qDhtkYXVnvNEhDJqzDVuWc28.jpeg) 
Today on the blog I talk a little about @Auzumel_S&#39;s hack of *Blades in the Dark* for our anime cyber-ninja setting, *Neo Shinobi Vendetta*. Actually I talk about it super little because I&#39;m more interested in the cool mission table I made up for it. 

**[Age of Ravens: Forging Shinobi](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/age-of-ravens-forging-shinobi)**

I&#39;ve embraced table-building to sublimate my trad impulse for session prep. It has several benefits. You don&#39;t have to think that hard-- you&#39;re just formalizing your brainstorming. Like I have no idea right this second what ***Hyper-Dimensional Passcoding*** or ***Primal Regression Fields*** are but I will eventually. Making randomizers doesn&#39;t take that long, and you can split them into multiple tables. Time spent creating these is time you&#39;re not fretting about plot and direction. Most importantly, table-building offers low-investment, high payoff work. You can use them for the length of a campaign. 

Anyway, tonight&#39;s our fourth session of five for NSV. The post has a link to the draft character keeper if you want to take a look.</description>

              <p>Yeah, the feedback from that game (and playing other BitD) games made me defintely want to have a well-defined “character scene” phase. Sherri took the unique failure modes and made them into seperate traumas for the different sources.</p>

              <p>I remember the Fate game we played of this, <a class="mention" href="/u/edige23">@edige23</a>  — it was over the top Anime, with us begging for more. I also remember one of <a class="mention" href="/u/richrogers">@RichRogers</a> comments being that he wished there was more character interaction built into it, so the downtime/homelife could really give that! I also remember that the weird failure modes were something we kept waiting to happen because we wanted to see them in action. So psyched for this!</p>
