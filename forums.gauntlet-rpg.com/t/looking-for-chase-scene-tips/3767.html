          <p>Are the PCs being hunted or are they competing with another group to be the first to reach a destination?</p>
<p>What kind of environment are they navigating? Is it vast space where overland travel speed matters or a claustrophobic cavern where vision and mobility are required?</p>
<p>I think what is important is to focus on the the group‚Äôs positions relative to one another rather than locations on a map. There should be some way for the players to have a constant reminder of their opponent and how close/far away they are. Things like beating drums, campfires in the distance, or even limited scrying.</p>
<p>I would also keep a minimum, like one or two max, of barriers that create a dead stop until overcome. A sheer cliff or stubborn door will be much more frustrating, especially under time pressure, to work around rather than hazards that can be mitigated with precision but save time by barreling through. A plain example would be a valley full of thorny briars, but even something like a room full of pressure plate traps that are easy but time-consuming to disarm. This can give the continual choice of balancing time vs safety instead and allows the players to focus on the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù of the chase instead of being bogged down by the individual encounters.</p>

          <p>Their airships just crash-landed, and their goal is to get the artifact they were transporting in those ships a crash-site to a place of power before all being harvested.</p>
<p>Each player has a primary PC with one or two useful occupational skills, and a good handful of Funnel World style villagers as followers. Those followers can both be useful for their knowledge/skills, and as ablative hit points.</p>
<p>As for setting, I expect it to be a primeval forest, lush, heavily canopied, with thick undergrowth. I was going for ‚Äúclaustrophobic with occasional clearings‚Äù.</p>
<p>I was going to have the players tell me what their characters saw between the airships and the Place of Power, and add those to the encounter list.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm good with having the thing following them be either a dramatic prod or a mechanism controlled threat.</p>
<p>Your idea of having PCs make frequent choices between <strong>using extra time to be extra safe now</strong>, or <strong>do something risky fast so the Threat doesn‚Äôt gain ground</strong> is strong. It is kind of what I was thinking of doing, I just hadn‚Äôt clarified it quite so well.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>I once played a scenario in D&amp;D where the DM literally set a countdown clock on their phone for one hour, and we players knew we had to complete various tasks in game during that real-life time. (The story was that we found out by intercepting a message there would be an attempt on the king‚Äôs life at a particular time.)</p>
<p>I think the DM partly came up with the idea because some of us were a bit slow deciding what to do when it was our turn in combat‚Ä¶  but it worked really well for the whole group, giving a sense of urgency to the play itself as well as our actions in the fiction.</p>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt want to play to timer every game, but as a special event it was great fun!</p>

          <p>I ran a long <em>Night‚Äôs Black Agents</em> campaign (hacked to PbtA) that involved a lot of chases. One thing I found helpful was breaking longer chases into distinct parts or legs (e.g., first leg of car chase through town to police roadblock gives way to second leg of offroad chase through the woods gives way to foot chase), and making sure they faced a variety of challenges or decisions. Some basic types to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Reactive decisions:</strong> The most common thing to throw into a chase scene, but overuse can make things feel exhausting or repetitive. <em>You take a few steps on the rope bridge and one of the support ropes just snaps, tipping the whole thing sideways. What do you do?</em></p>
<p><strong>Navigational decisions:</strong> If it‚Äôs an epic chase, consider integrating one or more junctures where they have to choose between two routes, each with inherent temptations and drawbacks. <em>From the ridgeline you‚Äôve just topped, you can see the tower in the valley far below. The right slope is a massive scree, tumbling steeply toward a dark wood of broken fir trees; to the left the mountainside cuts down into a sheltered ravine, but to get there you‚Äôd have to cross a stretch of exposed rock. What do you do?</em></p>
<p><strong>Team management decisions:</strong> Give them tough choices by threatening their followers or fellow PCs. <em>A cry rings out, and you look back to see that Darcy took a spill at that last rotten log you crossed. He‚Äôs not back on his feet yet, and the big lizard is bearing down. What do you do?</em></p>
<p>As far as mechanical approaches, consider formalizing the chase with a move. For example (off the top of my head, so untested):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RUN FOR IT</strong><br>
When you <em><strong>lead a chase</strong></em>, set Quarry (that‚Äôs you) to 1, Pursuer (that‚Äôs them) to zero, and ask the GM to choose a Finish value from 3-7, depending on how far you need to go to reach the next juncture.</p>
<p>Then, go go go and roll +DEX: <strong>on a 10+</strong>, Quarry gains 2 and you describe how you outdistance your pursuer; <strong>on a 7-9</strong>, Quarry and Pursuer each gain 1, and they‚Äôre still on you when you look over your shoulder; <strong>on a 6-</strong>, you face an unexpected hazard, hard decision, or other problem of the GM‚Äôs choosing, which probably includes Pursuer gaining 1 on you.</p>
<p>When <em><strong>Pursuer equals or exceeds Quarry</strong></em>, they‚Äôve caught up‚Äîyou‚Äôll have to deal with them somehow before you can do anything else. When <em><strong>Quarry equals or exceeds Finish</strong></em>, you‚Äôve reached the next juncture, and the GM says what happens next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my own playstyle it‚Äôs super-important for failure on the part of the PCs to be a real possibility. If the PCs get captured or the opposition seizes the MacGuffin first, things can get really interesting in unanticipated ways. If you haven‚Äôt already done so, give some consideration to what a fail state would look like, and think about the implications, given the motivations and goals of all concerned.</p>

          <p>I like this, and it makes me think that clocks‚Äìlike <a class="mention" href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/darren">@darren</a> suggests‚Äìcould work really well to represent the two ‚Äúfactions‚Äù of Quarry and Pursuer. The ‚Äúfinish value‚Äù would be how many segments the clock has, and you‚Äôd tick those off as you roll. I do think there should be ways to tick segments other than just the Run for It move, though‚Äìin my experience rolling the same move over and over can be kind of boring.</p>
