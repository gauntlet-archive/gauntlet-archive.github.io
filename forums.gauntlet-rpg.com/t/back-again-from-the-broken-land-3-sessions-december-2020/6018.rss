    <description>**Back Again from the Broken Land**
*You are little people who walked into a big war. The Doomslord’s forces were gathered in the Broken Land, and for some reason your small fellowship played a key role in their fall. Now, laden with stories to tell and burdens to bear, you set off on the journey home. But the Doomslord’s Hunters are still out there, and it’s a long way to walk... Back again from the Broken Land.*

*Back Again from the Broken Land* is a short Powered by the Apocalypse RPG by Leah Sargeant and Alexi Sargeant that was published in *Codex #44 - Home.* It is a game about small adventurers sharing stories on a long walk home from a terrible war. The game is inspired by the emotional and bittersweet stretches of *The Hobbit*  and *The Lord of the Rings.*

This is a three-part series that runs the first three Thursday nights of December. Attendance in all three sessions in strongly encouraged, but not required. You must sign up for each session individually.

Sessions will run 3 hours. We will be using Zoom for video chat, Roll Dice With Friends as a dice roller, Google Sheets for a shared character keeper, and possibly Google Drawings to share images, maps, etc. Rules will be taught at the table. Playbooks and a rules overview will be available to players prior to the start of the game.

If all players agree, this session will be recorded and made available for public viewing on YouTube.

**CONTENT WARNINGS**: The tone I am going for is reflective, optimistic, and perhaps a bit melancholy. Subject matter may include the horrors of war, regret, survivor&#39;s guilt, and moral quandaries. I am going for a &quot;PG-13&quot; rating.

**Safety Tools**: The X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, and Open Table will all be in use. Lines &amp; Veils will be gathered anonymously and then reviewed as a group. We will take a 5 minute breaks on the hour, and any other breaks requested by the players.
