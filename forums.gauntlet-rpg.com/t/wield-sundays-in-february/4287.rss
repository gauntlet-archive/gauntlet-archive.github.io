    <description>**You are an ancient and powerful magical artifact...**
**... and those who wield you believe themselves heroes...**
**... but they are nothing more than disposable pawns.**

After the fall of the Empire, the artifacts were scattered across the world; some thought that out of the hands of the Empress they would do little harm...

Wield is about power. How much do you have, how much do you give up and who has power over you? It is about negotiation and compromise, surrendering and gaining power over another.


In March and April I will run a sequel to this game series using Fellowship, but more of that in good time.

Being able to attend each session is recommended, but not mandatory. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. The sessions are scheduled for 3 hours and will be recorded on Zoom, but not made public without everyone&#39;s consent. 

**Content Warning:** By its nature, there are some control/agency issues involved – but in any case we&#39;ll have a safety discussion at the start and use Script Change.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and safety tools ([Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) will be in use.
