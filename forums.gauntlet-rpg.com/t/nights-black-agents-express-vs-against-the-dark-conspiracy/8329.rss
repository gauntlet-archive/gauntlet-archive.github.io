<p>Is it something similar?</p>

              <p>iirc the way we had it was key NPCs could be used to help with recovery and they were also targets for GM hard moves. If I were going to do it again, I would definitely lift Against the Dark Conspiracy’s single significant NPC with a danger clock attached to them.</p>

              <p>You can definitely run it in more of a trad style, although I don’t feel you’d get the most out of the system that way - one of the things I liked most was how it surprised me as the GM. But the rules include an extended section on using it to run published adventures, and I understand it evolved because <a class="mention" href="/u/alun_r">@Alun_R</a> wanted a system to run NBA adventures but found NBA itself crunchier than he liked.</p>
<p>I haven’t played NBA so couldn’t compare.</p>

              <p>Hi Sandy! Do you think the game will work with a more trad set-up where world-building/plot is skewed more heavily towards the GM?</p>
<p>If you’ve also played original NBA, can you compare it against that?</p>
