The year is 1980 and the Ramones are the rock’n’est band around. But when the tyrannical Principal Togar takes over at Vince Lombardi High School, she makes it her mission to keep the students from being corrupted by their rock’n’ tunes. To what lengths will the students go to see their favorite band when the Ramones come to town? Find out in “Teenage Nightmare: Rock ‘n’ Roll High School!” 

This game is scheduled for 3 hour-sessions using Zoom. If all players consent, it will be recorded. 

There will be 5 sessions total. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

Avery Alder’s *Teenage Nightmare* is a game of *belonging outside belonging* inspired by *Monsterhearts*. It is a game about the messy lives of teenage monsters, about secrets and discovery. It explores the terror of having a body that is changing without your permission. The monstrosity of these characters is literal: they are vampires, werewolves, witches, and more. But their monstrosity is also allegorical, standing in for experiences of alienation, shame, queerness, and self-destruction. 

We will use the X-Card, and Lines and Veils, and observe an Open Door policy. All players must abide by the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.
