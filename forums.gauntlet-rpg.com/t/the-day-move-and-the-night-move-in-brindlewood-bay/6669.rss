              <p>It’s a good question, and it probably depends a lot on the specific circumstances of what happened to trigger the frightful thing. It may be there is no good alternative option, but generally speaking, it probably means they have to abandon the moment or whatever thing they were gaining or accomplishing in the first place. Or it might mean they have to react in a way that isn’t being scared. Maybe it’s an opportunity to show what a badass they are, by taking some kind of direct action in the face of the fear.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the elucidation, Jason. What I still don‘t understand: What is the negotiation supposed to look like when The Day Move is triggered by fear and the player rolls a 7-9? When they see something gruesome, can they really try another way of coping? Any advice on that?</p>
