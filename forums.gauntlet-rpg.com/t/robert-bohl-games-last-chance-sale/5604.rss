    <title>Robert Bohl Games: Last Chance Sale</title>

    <description>Robert Bohl Games is going out of business on Saturday the 19th. Until then (that is, today and tomorrow), [all PDFs and books are on sale for half off](http://misspentyouth.robertbohl.com/shop). Robert Bohl Games also sells internationally, and retail customers’ discounts are on top of the 50% sale. And if you can’t afford the half-off price, RBG will work with you to get a price that works for you.</description>
