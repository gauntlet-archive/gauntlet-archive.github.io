    <description>*Hello again, friend of a friend, I knew you when*
*Our common goal was waiting for the world to end...*
*Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend*
*You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again* 

*Hearts of Wulin vs the World*  adapts our favorite RPG of romantic Wuxia to play out modern romantic adventures of magical-realism video game-inflected martial arts rock and roll. Think  *Scott Pilgrim vs the World* , the  *Persona*  games, maybe  *Glee*  or  *Josie and the Pussycats*  with more kung fu, add elements of Bollywood, K-Pop, and the Wu-Tang Clan, blend thoroughly, and serve.

We&#39;ll create a group of characters, including their musical talents, and throw them together into a musical romantic wuxia fantasia. Come prepared to describe the soundtrack over your fights, your amazing outfits, and your feelings that can only be properly expressed via music.

We&#39;ll use Safety Tools including Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and Open Door to make sure everyone has maximum fun. This event adheres to [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) in all other aspects.

You&#39;ll have more fun if you sign up for all 4 sessions, but it&#39;s not required. Note that we&#39;ll have a total of 4 players, one spot is reserved for the player who requested this series.

Tuesdays in October at 2:00 PM Eastern US time (7:00 PM GMT):
