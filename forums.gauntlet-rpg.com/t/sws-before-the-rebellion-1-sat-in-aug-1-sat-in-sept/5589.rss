Recently, Vincent Baker released four pages of a game on his Patreon that he is calling &quot;Before the Rebellion&quot;. He says he is still working out some of the basics, but I think it&#39;s playable and want to run it.

Here&#39;s Vincent&#39;s pitch for it:
**&quot;What I want in a Star Wars game is a different kind of Western. I want the kind where you&#39;ve got the bandit king&#39;s brother in your dinky jail, and you&#39;re an over-the-hill jedi, a drunk, a folk singer, and a crotchety old ex-stormtrooper deserter with a scattergun, and as soon as the bandit king figures this out, him and twenty hardened murderers are going to ride into town, shoot everyone they see, take their brother away, and leave the town burning. That&#39;s what you&#39;ve got and what you&#39;re up against. What&#39;s your play?&quot;**

*(I asked Vincent if it&#39;s cool that I run this, he said yes)*

***Warning - this series straddles the month of August and September (the first occurs at end of August, the second and last is in the beginning of September***
