    <title>Wilderness LARP?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/wilderness-larp/3759</link>
    <description>Hey all, just got back from PineCon (https://pineconsite.wordpress.com/). @tomes and I were chatting about how there haven&#39;t been many larps there...

The actual con&#39;s physical setting is at a summer camp set in the mountains behind Los Angeles. It is at the foot of a huge mountain nestled in national forest land.

Wonder if anyone has any suggestions for a LARP that can be played in the wilderness?

I&#39;m thinking of hiking out a ways away from the camp, and then larping it up.

And while I could spend hours searching on Google, I felt that the erudite and accomplished (not to mention good-looking) folks of the Gauntlet may have some thoughts.

 Thanks,
Chris</description>

              <p><strong>Witch</strong> as a walking game is super fun and atmospheric (and by now a Nerdly tradition), and highlights something I think is important and noteworthy - there are plenty of “tabletop” games that you can play standing up and walking around.</p>
<p><strong>Archipelago</strong><br>

<p>Basically any lightweight, low handling time game.</p>

<p>There are also occasionally larps designed for outdoor play among the Golden Cobras, like <a href="http://www.goldencobra.org/pdf/2018/Dragga%20and%20Hill%20--%20The%20Scarred%20Land.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">The Scarred Land</a>, which also teaches land navigation.</p>
<p>I’m also really into this as a designer - working with Jeeyon on an outdoor game currently, and I have another that’s ready to playtest if you are interested. You need a mile of trail and a spot for up to 16 people to meet.</p>
