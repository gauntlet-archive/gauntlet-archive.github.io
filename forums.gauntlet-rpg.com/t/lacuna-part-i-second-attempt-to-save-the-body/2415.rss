    <title>Lacuna Part I (second attempt): To Save The Body</title>

    <description>Agents are reminded to disregard empathy towards the Personalities of Blue City for the greater good of our nation. If you begin to experience empathy towards any Personality, Hostile or otherwise, then take a moment, relax, focus, and remember that we do this to help people. If it were not for us, the world would be a burning, horrific wreck. But because of our efforts crime is dropping, violence fading. We are making the world a better place.

These people are not monsters. They are suffering, and we must help them. It is the only way forward.

If feelings of empathy persist, immediately extract yourself from Blue City and report your emotional attachments to your immediate supervisor. An adequate response will be prepared to ease your burdens.

==== IMPORTANT ====

DO NOT ENGAGE OR INTERACT WITH THE GIRL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. IF YOU ENCOUNTER THE GIRL, IMMEDIATELY EXTRACT YOURSELF AND NEVER SPEAK OF IT TO ANYONE TO PREVENT POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION.

This session is scheduled for 3 hours and is part of a 3-session series. It will not be recorded. Being able to attend each session is preferred, but not required. You must RSVP for each session you wish to attend.

We’ll be playing Lacuna Part I (second attempt) by Jared A. Sorenson. Lacuna is a strange game, left unfinished and mostly unexplained. Players are Agents working for a secret quasi-government agency who do strange missions in a place called Blue City, a surreal world that exists in our collective unconscious.

The game by default has an emphasis on espionage, but I want to run it as a surreal psychological exploration that asks uncomfortable questions about the nature of the self.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours. It will not be recorded.

There will be 3 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

For safety, we&#39;ll be using the X-Card and Lines and Veils. The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy will, as always, be in effect.
