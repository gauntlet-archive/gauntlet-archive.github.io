This is for a one shot of *[Have a Familiar Ring](https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/have-a-familiar-ring)* by [Jamila R. Nedjadi](https://itch.io/profile/temporalhiccup). Rules will be taught. In the session we’ll discuss tone, pick a prompt, choose the magic user, and get to playing.

*Come together friends, and tell a story of magic.*

*One of you will be a magic-user. On your hand you wear many rings, each belonging to a familiar. The rest of you will play those familiars, assisting and thwarting the magic-user as you please.Together using prompts and permission to create a wild and untamed story, face the price of magic head on and write your destiny together.*

* Created for the [#YourMoveJam](https://itch.io/jam/your-move-jam), which stipulates working with the powered by apocalypse system to create a game centered around just ONE move.
* No GM or Facilitator required. Only prep is to read through the game once and then just get started!
* Evocative prompts to help you get started on your story

We will play using Zoom and record the session. We will use the X-Card as well as Lines &amp; Veils for safety. If you sign up and your attendance or RSVP changes, please also send me a message at edige23 at gmail. I will send out a group email a week before the session with set up and invite details. The session will between 3-4 hours.

[The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html) will be in play and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) safety tool will be in use.
