    <title>Two types of games (probably more though ;)</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/two-types-of-games-probably-more-though/7293</link>
    <description>Hello,
I&#39;ve been looking at a lot of gmless one-pagers, and I can see different sorts : 
- games where you set character projects and frame scenes to confront them. 
There&#39;s more improv in them. I think that comes from the &quot;american freeform&quot; movement ? 

- games where a mini-game serves both as a relaxation from creative effort and as a resolution mechanic, with narrative elements going in and out, mixed or altered. Simple narrative processors, like a over/under roll, or more complex, like a pbta Move. 

- games with an oracle, the heart of most solo games.

I don&#39;t mean to be exhaustive, divisive or anything. I just would like to follow up on this observation : which theories touch upon these differences and how ?</description>

              <p>For the first type, things like<br>
King is dead <a href="https://bullypulpitgames.com/games/free-games/free-game-downloads/">https://bullypulpitgames.com/games/free-games/free-game-downloads/</a> (not technically 1 page, but short enough)<br>
Maybe Follow his shoe<br>
<a href="https://meaton124.itch.io/follow-his-shoe">https://meaton124.itch.io/follow-his-shoe</a></p>
<p>For the second type,<br>
Lasers and Feelings for instance <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/">http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/</a></p>
<p>The solo engine is clearly 3.</p>
<p>2 is largely dominant.</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain what I mean with the 1 I guess, and it’s rarer, so I have trouble finding them again. Picture this : the game creates a bubble structure, and players are free within each bubble scene. Like For the Queen or Fall of magic. Only in 1 page. Sometimes they have a resoultion mechanic for the whole story, or to acknowledge how each scene went, or to mitigate PvP. But the scenes are the heart of the game.</p>

              <p>Hey DeReel,</p>
<p>Can you give one or two examples for the first two type of games in the list? <a href="https://inflatablestudios.itch.io/one-page-solo-engine" rel="nofollow noopener">One Page Solo Engine</a> would seem to fit the last one and the second one.</p>
