    <title>HUMANITY LOST: After Armageddon - Mondays in November</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/humanity-lost-after-armageddon-mondays-in-november/7519</link>
    <description>Open access time for this game is [date=2021-10-23 time=12:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;]

**THIS IS A BETA PLAYTEST.**  As such, many mechanics and systems are not in a final state. Please only sign up if you are interested in being part of the development process and providing feedback on the game.

&gt; *For the last decade the Kingdoms of Heaven and Hell have been warring for control of our mortal realm. Earth has become a battleground; scarred and broken by the constant battles raging above and below it. Our cities have been decimated, and we have not had the strength to defend our home. Until now. You, our great creations, are our only chance against the Angels and Demons that plague our world. You are the hope of the Third Kingdom.*

HUMANITY LOST is an action-packed RPG of human souls who have given up some of their humanity to fight back against armageddon. The legions of Heaven and Hell march against the last bastion of mankind, and only you can stop them. The lightweight LUMEN system is easy to pick up, quick to play, and replicates the fast-paced, combo heavy gameplay of games like Bayonetta and Darksiders.

This is a 4 session series. I fully expect drop-in, drop-out play, so please sign up for as many sessions as you are able.

No knowledge of the rules or pregenerated characters are necessary, everything will be taught during the session.

We will be using Zoom and an online dice roller to play. The series will be recorded and shared with player permission. I will send out an e-mail 1 week in advance with all of this information again to remind folks.

## Content Warnings and Safety Tools

Similar to Diablo, Darksiders, Bayonetta, or Doom, this game is fairly gruesome and deals with some heavy topics. We can use Lines and Veils to mitigate these as appropriate, but by default these themes will be in play:

* Graphic descriptions of injury or violence
* Threats to a community
* Body dysphoria/dysmorphia
* Strong religious themes

In addition to using Lines and Veils, we will be using Script Change, the X card, and the Open Door Policy. All of these will be explained at the beginning of the series as needed. This game follows [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)
