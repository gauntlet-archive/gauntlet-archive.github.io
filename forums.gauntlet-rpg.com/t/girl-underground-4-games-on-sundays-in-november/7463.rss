    <description>*&quot;Oh, good morning, young lady! You look a wee bit discombobulated ... yes, I am a dragon. Sort of. A kettledragon, on account of my mother having been a teakettle. What do you mean, that&#39;s ridiculous? You have leaves in your hair and earth on your dress, and neither seems quite intentional, so who&#39;s ridiculous, really? No, I don&#39;t know how you got here. Neither do I know the way to your home - maybe you should as an oracle? You don&#39;t know any oracles? You are extraordinarily uninformed, I think, so I will help you find the oracles of the west, south and east. What? North? Oh no, you don&#39;t want to go North, young lady. Certainly not!!&quot;*

We will play four sessions of Girl Underground, a game by Jesse Ross &amp; Lauren McManamon about a girl who falls into a fantastic world, meets strange companions, and learns about the world and herself. The girl is a shared character, but each player will also play a companion of their very own!

Session One ([date=2021-11-07 time=13:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]): https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Ml611zFIV10bMPzQ91U
Session Two ([date=2021-11-14 time=13:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]): https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Ml61MXw_AA3pBC3nmrl
Session Three ([date=2021-11-21 time=13:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]): https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Ml6296fzK5vXETAy9Ww
Session Four ([date=2021-11-28 time=13:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;]): https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-Ml62QUQv9pbFATkEMum

Jammi will be a guest star for these games.

Being able to attend all sessions is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.

No experience is needed; everything will be taught in the game.

**Venue** : Zoom

**Contact** : Players will receive an e-mail to check in about a week before the start of the game.

We will discuss Content, Aim, Tone, and Safety Tools in the first sessions. We will use Lines &amp; Veils, the X-Card, and the Open Door policy, and I will prepare a character keeper as a shared document.

The  **Gauntlet Code of Conduct**  will be in effect for this gam **e**  (https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html)!</description>
