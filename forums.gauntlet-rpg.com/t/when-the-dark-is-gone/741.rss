    <description>On Saturday [date=2019-05-18 time=20:30:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Dublin&quot;] → [date=2019-05-18 time=23:30:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/Dublin&quot;] I&#39;m running When the Dark is Gone, a game from the Seven Wonders Anthology. 

Imagine the children in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. They visited a magical land, fought battles alongside talking animals and centaurs and won a war against a powerful and evil enemy. Then they returned home, no-one believed them and they were back to war time rations and maths homework. What did that feel like? How did they live with the memories of what they experienced?

Did they end up in therapy?

When the Dark is Gone is a GM’d story game for 3-4 players, who take on the roles of Clients in a real-world, modern-day setting, whose serious psychological disorders are damaging them and those closest to them. The game is set in their group therapy session – one final attempt to get their lives back on track.

[Sign up!](https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-L_t22ZEWAIR1M0QL0lJ)

The playset addresses drug use, drug dealing, verbal and non-sexual violent abuse and disease.
