    <description>*You are all Creators.*

*You each use science, magic, power, or energy to bring things into being.*

*Your greatest Creation, your masterpiece has broken free.*

*You must follow its trail.*

*You will destroy it. Or it will destroy you.*

*This Thing We Started* is a game by Tracy Barnett based on For the Queen. Each player is one of a group of Creators whose greatest Creation has escaped. You take turns answering questions about the Creation in turn, learning more about your Creation and your relationship with it, until you finally confront them and either destroy them, or are destroyed.

I will be running a one-shot of The Brokenhearted, a companion game in which you play a Creation being pursued by their Creators, the following Monday.

We will be using the X-Card, the Open Table policy, and Lines and Veils as safety tools. Tone will probably be PG-ish.
