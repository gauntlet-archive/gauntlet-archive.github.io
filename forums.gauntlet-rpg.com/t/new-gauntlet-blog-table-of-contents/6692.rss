    <title>New Gauntlet Blog Table of Contents</title>

    <description>After putting this task off for a long time, I&#39;ve finally created a master index to the Gauntlet Blog. We&#39;ve broken down articles into about a dozen broad categories. I built this on work done by some other folks, so it wasn&#39;t nearly as time-consuming as I feared. 

It&#39;s not a complete index of all of our Gauntlet Blog posts. For example, if folks think it is worthwhile I can also do a separate video roundup index. I&#39;ve also not listed posts which were time dependent or outdated. Entries under each heading are in chronological order.
