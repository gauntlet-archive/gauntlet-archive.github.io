Greg Gelder and I have been cooking up a World of Dungeons hack specifically for Star Wars. Yes, we&#39;re aware there are a number of them already in existence and we STOLE SOME STUFF from them and a bunch of other games to make something we&#39;re excited to run / play for Star Wars Saturdays.

It&#39;s a lightweight but flavorful look at Star Wars gaming built on a few years of solid gaming in the genre / setting.

We&#39;re looking for feedback on the following:

* Do the Approaches (aka stats), gear, and skills cover the kinds of stuff you want for a PC?
* We want to try out the ship mechanics and see if they work / are fun
* What&#39;s missing?

This game is part of the ongoing Star Wars Saturdays series. The time setting is  *after*  the end of Episode VI of the Star Wars movie series (that&#39;s  *Return of the Jedi* ) when the Empire is falling and the Alliance to Restore the Republic is taking control in fits and starts. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the SWS canon for future miniseries and will be added to our wiki (https://starwarssaturdays.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page).

**CW: Violence, severed arms maybe, swashbuckling action, Willhelm screams.**
**System**  : PbtA
**Duration**  : One 3 hour session
**Breaks**  : 1 mid-point break per session (10 mins)
**Venue**  : GM’s Zoom
**Recording**  : Yes, but made public only if consent is given by all players
**Safety**  : Lines &amp; Veils, X-card, and open-door policy. Tools can be changed to suit the players. This game will follow the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
