    <description>This is for a two shot of *Pipedream* by Kai Poh. [PIPEDREAM](https://roleoverplaydead.itch.io/pipedream) is a #SWORDDREAM roleplaying game of detectives, problem-solving, and rural mysteries in a fantastic world; or a farcical drug comedy. You may play it as both. Rules will be taught. In session one we’ll discuss tone, choose the game frame, and get to playing. Participation in both sessions is strongly encouraged. Content Warning: Fantasy drug use.  

You are members of an exclusive smoking club, the Lodge of the Wisefellows, in the quiet halfling country of Irisfields. As Wisefellows, you are occasionally called upon to solve mysteries and act as community troubleshooters.

Fortunately, you have been supplied with magical Elder Weed, which provides cosmic insights when smoked.

Unfortunately, you are in actuality irascible scoundrels who do not belong anywhere near a crime scene.

Also, if you imbibe too much of the weed, you may forget the troubles of the world and become lost in your own smoke. Permanently.

It’s your first official case.

Good luck.
