*&quot;When You Try To Win Someone&#39;s Heart Roll +Sway&quot;*

This is four sessions of Monsterhearts 2e. The intended tone is inspired by the above quote from the designer in the first design post for Monsterhearts; this is a game to play to win the hearts of others and to make hard decisions as to with whom your character should ultimately be with.

This will be a player-first, highly collaborative game in which everyone will create the town together and the action will focus on the PCs&#39; agendas. External adversity and mysteries will support this focus rather than having being a driving force themselves. In certain circumstances, I may ask players to briefly portray NPCs so as to keep everyone involved as much as they wish.

**Technical details**
Note that this game will be played over audio chat and supporting shared documents. There will be no video chat for this game. The audio will be retained for reference, but I do not intend to release it publicly and will not do so without all players&#39; permission.

The game will be played on Discord audio and text channels, with a shared Prezi whiteboard. Players are encouraged to sign up for a free Prezi account, but this is not mandatory.

**Content warnings &amp; Safety tools**
Monsterhearts is a game about the exploration of teenage self, including gender and sexuality, and will likely contain both elements of teen sexual activity and horror.

These sessions will use:
- a content &#39;palette&#39; incorporating Lines &amp; Veils
- Brie Beau Sheldon&#39;s [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m) toolbox plus a &quot;prompt&quot; tool
- active check-ins where requested

Signing up to all four sessions is not mandatory, however note that, unless explicitly requested, PCs may be continued to be played by the MC or other players. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play.
