    <title>Everything has 1 HP</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/everything-has-1-hp/8688</link>
    <description>Just a funny little idea here.

Everything has 1hp. That guy? 1hp. That rock? 1hp. That eldritch horror from the 5th dimension? 1hp.

I was thinking about lethality. You can kill any individual with a rock. The hp abstractions is silly, although I recognize what it is useful for.

So the point is that each thing has its own &quot;vulnerabilities&quot;.

A rock is only vulnerable to a bigger rock. That guy is only vulnerable to what can get through his armour and his ability to dodge. That eldritch horror? Idk, 6th dimention stuff?

Anyways, just some silly thoughts.</description>

              <p>it is something akin to 2400 systems. You can be hindered, injured or dead. No hit points, but you may break armor in order to mitigate some or all wound from single source. the rest comes from fiction, so if you even can hurt something (like barehanded attacking a tank) is a different case</p>
