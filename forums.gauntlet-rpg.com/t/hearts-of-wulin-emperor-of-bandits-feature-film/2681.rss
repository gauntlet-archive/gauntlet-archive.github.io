    <description>**Hearts of Wulin: Emperor of Bandits Feature Film** 

Darren was so sad that my last offering was new players only that I set up another 2-session feature so he could play, but we need 3 other lucky (plucky?) players to join us for Romantic Wuxia melodrama!

This is a 2-session &#39;feature film&#39;, so please sign up during the first week only if you can make a good-faith effort to attend both session. If seats are still available when Open Signup comes, you may sign up for single sessions.

The self-styled Emperor of Bandits has died under mysterious circumstances, and now every unsavory character with a band of thugs and will to power is converging on your province to take control of the Leopard Throne.

Session 1 of 2: [date=2019-09-04 time=20:00:00 timezone=&quot;America/New_York&quot;]: https://gauntlet-hangouts.firebaseapp.com/event-detail/-LkMnLE_XPA0x_PZKXie
