    <description>CBR+PNK



“CBR+PNK is a tabletop RPG for one-shot sessions in the cyberpunk genre. Player characters are a team of RUNNERS - mercs, criminals, activists living on the edge and running in the shadows of a gritty, ultraviolent world.



In each game we play an entire new cast of characters making their LAST RUN.”



CW: Violence, substance abuse, classism, cybernetic implants.



SESSIONS: This is a one-shot.



DURATION: 3 hours.



NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Three players in addition to the facilitator. One seat held for Michael Pelletier.



SAFETY TOOLS IN USE: X-Card, Lines &amp; Veils, Open Door Policy, Stars &amp; Wishes. The game will follow the Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct.



VENUE/TECH: Zoom Video, Google Character Keeper, Roll With Me. Expect an email one week before the first session with the Roll20 link, and another an hour or so before the session.



BREAKS: Two 5-10 minute breaks at the top of each hour.



RECORDING: Sessions will be recorded, but would only be posted with full enthusiastic player consent.  Currently the plan is to record only for the facilitator’s reference.



PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: None – rules will be taught in play.
