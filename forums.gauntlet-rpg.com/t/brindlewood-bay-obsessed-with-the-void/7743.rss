    <title>Brindlewood Bay: Obsessed with the Void</title>

    <description>Hello!
I am preparing for my first BB session, really excited about it!

I have a quick question:
In the fourth Crown of the Void it&#39;s said that you gain the &quot;Obsessed with the Void&quot; condition but, unless my search-fu is failing me, it&#39;s never said what it does.
Is it just that it takes a condition slots so you are more likely to have to use a crown?</description>

              <p>That’s always been my reading of it. It takes up a condition slot, but it’s also a guide for pole-playing and it’s a good guidepost for GM moves. If someone’s Obsessed with the Void, then that’s going to significantly shape both what happens to them on a miss and how I describe it.</p>
