Send me, Gerrit, a link. Either here or on the Gauntlet Slack. I will make a copy of the file and add it. If you don’t want me to put your name in the list of all contributors, I can list you as <em>anonymous</em>. Please tell me in that case.</p>
<p>Importantly, the material should either have no copyright relevant material in it or a confirmation by the creator that they are OK with us hosting the play aid online.</p>
<p>This is pure fan work, no contracts or change in ownership. I can take your play aid out of the folder any time you don’t want it there anymore.</p>
