    <title>Gauntlet calendar feature request: Filter games by time of day</title>

    <description>My apologies if this is not a good place to post this.

I submitted a feature request for the Gauntlet calendar directly through Github. The developer said I should run the idea by Lowell. Is that you, @edige23 ?

Filtering by time of day would let me easily see which games were at times that I was prepared to play. The full feature request is here: https://github.com/srcooney/TheGauntletWebsite/issues/1</description>
