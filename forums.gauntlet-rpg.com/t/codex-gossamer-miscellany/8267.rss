    <title>Codex - Gossamer Miscellany</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/codex-gossamer-miscellany/8267</link>
    <description>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Gossamer! The prompt for this miscellany is: “What is out there in the Gossamer Void?” For those unfamiliar, the Gossamer Void is a part of the setting in Trophy where few details have been established so far–now is our chance to paint the landscape! What we know about the Gossamer Void so far: it is only reachable by magic or ships that fly through the sky in some sort of astral plane or other realm not normally reachable from Ambaret or Fort Durin. In the Void are floating “islands” inhabited by strange individuals (there is even an entire archipelago out in the Void). For more inspiration, here are the two Trophy Gold incursions that have touched on the Gossamer Void so far: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f8tlsTyF1fdCKl81xNZzghlw39S-NBco/view?usp=sharing

For each entry, when you consider “what is out there in the Gossamer Void,” try focusing on just one of the following ideas: 1) the name, look, crew, and purpose of a flying ship that travels the Gossamer Void; 2) a treasure, and where it is rumored to be hidden; 3) a trap, and how it interferes with treasure-hunters; or 4) a monster, richly detailed and a habit or two it has as it dwells in the Void. 

Submissions should be no more than 1-3 short sentences. By submitting here in the replies, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please do not submit any entries with sexist imagery (we won’t publish it).

Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).

For this miscellany, we’re looking for things that are fantastical, horrifying, otherworldly, and occasionally humorous or ironic. Here are some examples:

“Captain Faust sails a ship formed from superheated sand. Three-quarters of the Glass Cannon’s crew are always blind folded while the rest work in a hobbled state to restrict how fast they can move. These precautions are necessary when hunting a beast that drives someone mad with nothing more than a look from any one of its ten-thousand eyes.”

“They say a solidly black chunk of land floats in a perpetually black piece of sky. If anyone could navigate to this rock, they would find the thrice-locked black chest–inside, the black heart of the immortal king.”

“Some try to navigate the Void by complex star models – a kind of three-dimensional version of a star chart. The dangerous bit is when you mistake a school of glowing void-krill for a star and navigate into the bull-whale fishery. Few survive their first encounter with the tri-jawed giants.”

“On a particularly green and lush rock, a group of long-limbed and hairy humanoids seem to cry for help from in the tree-line. Only when treasure-hunters get too close can they see these “creatures” for what they are – the many hands of a much larger creature that seeks to devour the crew and use their clothes to make more finger puppets.”</description>

Stephan is an affable and charismatic individual of medium height, slender build, and utterly indeterminate gender clad in fashionable travelling garb. They are always encountered in some exceedingly improbable location, waving their trademark plumed hat to get the attention of a passing vessel. When taken aboard, the story of how they found themselves there is invariably a tale of fantastical absurdity and dubious heroism, but always with a nugget of truth for those who listen carefully.</p>

There are gnashing teeth nestled in bloody gums, there are too many arms each concluded with too many hands with too many digits, there are milky eyes that seem to see nothing and everything at once, there is a song that is so loud and blasphemous you can feel it reverberate in your bones. No one sees all of these at once, for it would kill them, so the mind divides it into its many awful parts. Each treasure hunter that views the monstrous singer must make a Risk Roll. If they fail, they pick one of the following conditions and explain what they see in their dreams until the condition is removed: Swallowed by the Ravenous Gullet, Seen by the Gossamer Eyes, Touched by the Too Many Hands, Humming the Profane Tune.</p>

Veteran sailors collect the symbols that evoke them, ritually carved into each knuckle of gnarled hands and rubbed with the ash of dying stars. The final word is a black whorling glyph evoking a nameless screaming terror devoid of light and hope.</p>

              <p>Veteran travelers of the Gossamer Void share tales of tall luminescent humanoids swathed in motes of iridescent ash that obscure the details of their features. The Veilbearers are said to offer safe passage through the darkest parts of the Void at a cost and arrive in times of great yearning or desperation. The price always differs, but it’s never an easy one to repay.</p>

While a treasure in itself, it is also rumoured to contain a secret ritual to elongate life far beyond natural means. The Veiled Queen herself is rarely seen – she and her tapestry are safely guarded at the top of a tall crystalline tower that looms over a small island populated by fervent worshippers.</p>
