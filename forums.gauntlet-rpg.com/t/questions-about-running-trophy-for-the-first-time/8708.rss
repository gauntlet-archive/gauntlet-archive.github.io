    <title>Questions about Running Trophy for the First Time</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/questions-about-running-trophy-for-the-first-time/8708</link>
    <description>I&#39;m finally running Trophy for the first time since getting all the physical Kickstarter stuff (I ran Trophy Dark out of Codex once back in the day), and I have some questions to ask more experienced folks.

Should I start with Trophy Dark or go straight to Gold? The plan is for this to be a one-shot with the potential to play more if everyone enjoys it.

Is there a particular incursion that is widely regarded to be the best for introducing the game? Or, if not, one that is a general favorite?

I&#39;m excited! Thanks, y&#39;all.</description>

              <p>I’ve barely played these two games, so if someone else has different things to say, take their word for it.</p>
<p>However, that said, I don’t think the Dark and Gold are like a “basic” and “advanced” version of the same game (although I can see how someone might get that idea). They have quite a bit of overlap, but are fundamentally different games and experiences. I think you should start with whichever one appeals you to more. Dark is a single-run horror story. Gold is kind of an emulation of old-school D&amp;D play (dungeon crawls), and works with an “adventure module” (even one not written for Trophy).</p>
<p>I don’t have any particular incursions to recommend!</p>
