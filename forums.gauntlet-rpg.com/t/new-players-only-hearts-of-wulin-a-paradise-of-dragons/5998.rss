    <description># New to the Gauntlet? This is the game for you!
_This game is open only to players who joined The Gauntlet in the last three months, or have never been in a regular monthly session._

------

A young man arrives in the capital city. He is a peasant and has traveled a long way. He enters the palace for an audience with the emperor. He waits and waits, and is among the last to be seen. Upon approaching the emperor, he takes a deep breath, levels a finger at the emperor’s daughter and demands to know why she put a curse on him. The princess, normally the picture of indifferent serenity, is shocked and horrified at the accusation. 

Before she can protest, the young man convulses, collapsing to the palace floor. The emperor rises from his throne in alarm, only to be surrounded by his most loyal guard. The princess, fearful for the young man’s fate, reaches out a hand. The young man looks up, fixing his gaze on the princess, and his eyes glow yellow, the power of the golden sun behind them. 

He rises, and in one motion he transforms into a dragon, a great beast of shimmering scales and gleaming claws and eyes like embers. A growl emanates from the depths of the creatures throat, and it belches flames, engulfing the drapery behind the throne. The dragon vaults through the window and unleashes terror on the capital city. 

You stand below staring at the dragon soaring through the air while the crowds around you in the marketplace flee in terror. And then you see her, the princess, standing on a ledge protruding from the palace, silk robes streaming in the breeze and the glint of a sword in her right hand.

----- 

**Hearts of Wulin** is wuxia-style drama, Powered by the Apocalypse. We’ll use the **supernatural playbooks** to give it a fantasy flavor.

You do not need to sign up for all four sessions, but it is preferable if you do.
