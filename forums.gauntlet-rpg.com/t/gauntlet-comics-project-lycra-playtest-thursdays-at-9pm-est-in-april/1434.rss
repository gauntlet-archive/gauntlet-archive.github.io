Thursday nights in April, I&#39;m going to be running a playtest of my best buddy Jen&#39;s newest game design - **Project Lycra**. What&#39;s Project Lycra? It&#39;s &quot;Grown-Up Masks with Feels&quot;. Jen started with the Masks Adult Moves and has created new Team Mechanics as well as a track for confidence vs. trust.

I&#39;ll be running the game and Jen will be playing. Be advised, this game is in an early state of development, so things might change between sessions. Trust me though, she&#39;ll be making it more awesome each time.

-----------------------------------
This game is part of the ongoing Gauntlet Comics series. Characters and settings created in this miniseries will exist in the Gauntlet Comics canon (and on our wiki) for future miniseries.
