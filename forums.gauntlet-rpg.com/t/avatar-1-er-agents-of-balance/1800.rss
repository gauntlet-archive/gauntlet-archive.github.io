    <description>Each session is scheduled for 3 hours. Being able to attend each session is ideal, but not required. Anyone can attend any session, even if they did not attend previous sessions You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend.


&quot;Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Not too long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked...&quot;

In this series, we will be playing a soft hack of Robert Nolan&#39;s 1%er - The Outlaw Motorcycle Game set in an alternative history version of the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender. 

The players will be members of the Resistance, a group of fighters that employ espionage and guerrilla warfare to try and hold off the Fire Nation&#39;s colonization efforts and protect the Avatar so he can train for his fateful encounter with the Fire Lord and his forces.

A short document detailing the setting will be provided, so no knowledge of Avatar is required. It&#39;s a fantasy world heavily influenced by East-Asian culture, with martial arts and elemental manipulation.

The X-card will be used, and we will be observing the Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy (http://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).
