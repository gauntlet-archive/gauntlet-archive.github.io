This game will take place on [date=2019-05-12 time=16:00:00  timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot;] and is scheduled for four hours. The session will be recorded, and uploaded to YouTube with the consent of all participants. Lovecraftesque is a collaborative storytelling game designed to create brooding cosmic horror in the vein of HP Lovecraft, but free of the weight of the Mythos and its sometimes problematic content.

This session we will play with the House-Sitter scenario by Jason Cordova. The Witness is Olivia Kirk, a freelance production assistant who has been asked to house-sit by Marvin Tennenbaum, a big-shot movie producer. He lives at the Gardenia House, a mansion in the Hollywood hills, set on 2 acres of beautifully manicured grounds, with pool and private tennis court. Originally built in the 1920s, the house has passed through several owners over the years. Marvin Tennenbaum purchased the property in 2005.

The game will be played in accordance with [The Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html), and the [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in play. Lovecraftesque is a game about horror, and we are likely to deal with some disturbing themes. These include existential dread, despair, mental health issues, violence and body horror. We will have a discussion on content including lines and veils before we begin play.

              <p>Damn, I’d love to have a foot in with this, but I’ll be treading the boards in a magic contest. This scenario might be my favourite from the <strong>Lovecraftesque</strong> prompts</p>
