    <description>Hi all!
I discovered this year itch.io and I love it! Unfortunately, sometimes there are games that I would find interesting but they just stay hidden.

I started [a spreadsheet on google docs to fill it with information on itch.io games](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K7EXijOrX-VA-PjtTgO-BBOu_7NF8_JBeUC4RRoUwnw/edit?usp=sharing). It is open for everyone so feel free to add, modify or steal it as you like. Have you created a game? Just add it to the list!</description>
