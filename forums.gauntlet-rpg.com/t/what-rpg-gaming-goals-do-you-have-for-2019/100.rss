    <title>What RPG gaming goals do you have for 2019?</title>

    <description>There are so many awesome games and events to look forward to. In no particular order here are somethings I want to do:

* Run and play in more games from Codex.
* Conclude my face to face DW campaign. 
* Go through my physical RPG books, and redistribute some books to folks. Hopefully netting more total sparked joy.
* Get a meta level intro game run for The Gauntlet... inspired by Strange Gravity (might just be a light hack of it) with @shane and MXH.
* Make sure Gauntlet Games Now runs _at least_ once a month</description>

              <p>Oh nice! Yeah, I guess I’m trying to find a game a little more mechanically motivated than Hearts of Wulin[1], but that can capture the Wuxia vibe with a reasonable amount of crunch. This is a hard ask.</p>
<p>[1] I’m actually super excited about this game and I think they made awesome decisions (the way they handle fighting is absolutely on point for what they’re doing with the genre). That said, I think there is space for games that focus on other aspects of Wuxia <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> For example, I’ve been thinking about a sort of blades of the dark inspired game where everyone is running a martial arts sect…</p>

              <p>For the wuxia games, I don’t know if I’ll run them, but I’m very curious how they handle the genre (I’m a huge wuxia fan). Thus far I know of Weapons of the Gods, Qin, Legends of the Wulin, legend of the elements, and of course Gauntlet’s own Hearts of Wulin. I also have a list of games that I think games in the genre could draw from, like street fighter, wuxing: the Ninja crusade, l5r, tenra bansho zero, jadepunk, even exalted…</p>
<p>I guess one day I’d also like to make some sort of wuxia based game but now with them making HoW, I need to first decide what I think is missing <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and I want to understand the prior art…</p>
<p>Edit: and yeah ars magica is a work of beauty in so many ways. I also really love their take on mythic Europe. Sometimes the rules on rules on rules that come in the extended books can be a bit overwhelming, but the core of the game is so cool. I want something that feels like that for wuxia (though less complex for skill resolution etc hah)</p>

              <ul>
<li>prioritize TTRPGs as a hobby. I’ve loved them forever but have been very unsuccessful at playing in any for a while. Hoping to get some PBPs off the ground…it’s not easy, but hoping! might even try to do some online play, though my current time zone makes that tricky, and I don’t really like one shots. I might consider running some Gauntlet hangouts if I can swing it though, good chance to mix things up, get some experience with new people, and try some systems I won’t get to play with otherwise. Chinese timezone and the great firewall make this rough though</li>
<li>finish up the massive library of Ars Magica extended books, and actually like…have a grip on the system</li>
<li>play the hell out of Hearts of Wulin once the full rules drop</li>
<li>read some of the rulebooks I’m super interested in for various reasons…I have a stack and need to make my way through it (priorities right now: King Arthur Pendragon, Street Fighter, mage the Ascension, Dresden files, a number of WuXia games, and then so many more…)</li>
<li>continue to organize my thoughts around some settings and even potential RPGs I’d like to design. Right now I need to play more and read more, but still, would like to develop more coherent thoughts here</li>

              <p>I feel like I should be able to hit these three goals by end of 2019.</p>
<p>I’m signed up to run/facilitate 3-4 games that are new to me at an upcoming convention in MN: Questlandia, The King Is Dead, For the Queen, with maybe Kingdom (played it but never facilitated).</p>
<p>Registered for Metatopia. Need to get two games ready for it–most likely will be Dark Well and Vigilance.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on several games, most recently on the following two: Space Station Omega and NightMirror.</p>
<p>Because of my crazy work schedule I haven’t been able to commit to running any online games, but I’d like to give it a go through the Gauntlet later this year once I’ve gotten some things in place in RL. This may be my unofficial official 4th goal for the year.  <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
