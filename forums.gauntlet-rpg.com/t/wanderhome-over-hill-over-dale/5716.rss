Wanderhome is a pastoral fantasy Role-Playing Game about traveling animal-folk, the world they inhabit, and the way the seasons change. It is a game filled with grassy fields, mossy shrines, herds of chubby bumblebees, opossums in sundresses, salamanders with suspenders, starry night skies, and the most beautiful sunsets you can imagine. You might be a tamarin who dances with small and forgotten gods, a leporine mail carrier who relies on moths to get packages where they belong, a little lizard with a big heart and a mysterious past, or a near-endless number of other thrilling possibilities. No matter what, we’re always travelers—animal-folk who go from village to village and get to see the length and breadth of all the world of Hæth. The seasons will change as we play, and we will change with them. But I can’t tell you all that will happen on our journey together, along the winding dirt road and amid the grassy fields. We’re just going to have to find that out together.

This event is scheduled to run for 3 hours.

There will be 4 sessions in total. Being able to attend each session is ideal but not required. You must RSVP to each session you wish to attend. 

There are reserved seats for Jammi, Mario, and Bodhi.

We will be using the free playkit version, available [here](https://jdragsky.itch.io/wanderhome).

We will be using Zoom for our calls and I will send out the link for the call about 10 minutes before each session.

[The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) will be in play and safety tools (Script Change, X-Card, and Lines &amp; Veils) will be in use. The game also offers other safety tools that we will try to make use of.
