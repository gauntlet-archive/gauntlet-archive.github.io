    <title>What should I call action rolls in Quietus?</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/what-should-i-call-action-rolls-in-quietus/1001</link>
    <description>I&#39;m doing the final passes on my Forged in the Dark hack, Quietus. I&#39;ve renamed and retooled a lot of the terms and mechanics to make them fit my theme of melancholy horror, but action rolls are still called action rolls, and that sounds a bit too... well, actiony. Does anyone have any ideas of an alternative name for them? Risk rolls maybe? Though it sounds a bit too close to getting Rickrolled.</description>
