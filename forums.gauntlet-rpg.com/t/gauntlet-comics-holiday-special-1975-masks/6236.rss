    <description>***From the Pages of Gauntlet Comics, we present to you this classic from years gone by! First Published, December 1975, Gauntlet Comics Holiday Special: Saving Santa!***

*It&#39;s Christmas time at the Justice Alliance Headquarters, in Continuum City, and the Heroes and their Sidekicks and junior partners are coming from all cities over the world to celebrate together. When the adults are called away on a sudden mission to space, only the Junior Members are left when a sudden distress call comes in from the North Pole! Santa&#39;s Workshop is being attacked by a Group of Grumpy Grinches! Bah Humbug indeed! Now having to work together for the first time, it&#39;s up to these Teen Heroes to Save Christmas!*

You are playing one of these teens banding together for the first time. They are partners and Sidekicks of a member of the Justice Alliance, dealing with the villains that are trying to Cancel Christmas! We will be exploring a team coming together to save the world in a Silver Age scenario. I request each hero all be from a different city, that you can make up, that exists within Gauntlet Comics.

Playbooks Available will be: **The Beacon, The Bull, The Delinquent, The Janus, The Legacy, The Nova, The Outsider, The Protege, The Transformed**

This is going to be a 1 session game of approximately 4 hours, we might go longer since it is a one off and we wil have some character creation to deal with.

We will be using **Streamyard** to meet and **Google Docs** for characters. Everything you need to play the game will be provided for you.  Game will be recorded with permission, or be deleted upon request. 

Safety tools used will be (at least) the **X-card, lines &amp; veils, and script change tools** . More can be used if wanted!

The **Gauntlet Inclusivity Policy** and **Open Door Policy** will be in effect, and the **Gauntlet Code of Conduct** can be found here: https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html

One spot in this game has been reserved.
