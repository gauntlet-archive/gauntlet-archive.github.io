    <description>I present to you the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://teylen.blog/2022/02/06/crowdfunding-collection-190/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crowdfunding Collection #190, including every tabletop rpg project started between 02/01 and 02/06&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

With the ZineQuest 2022 in full swing this week had about 124 projects going live.
Alot of them via itch.io fundings, who I found thanks to the ZIMO website. So far I haven’t seen another way to browse itch.io fundings. If you know about projects that I missed or those that are started within the next week, just contact me.
