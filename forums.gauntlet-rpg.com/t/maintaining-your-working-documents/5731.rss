    <description>When designing a game, how do you keep all your working documents in sync?

My process, right now which is far from perfect:

* Use a **google sheet** to keep all the elements of game -- playbooks, specifically, but maybe other elements.
* Use a **google doc** to write the rules, especially moves and sensitizing elements. (Personally, I like to write a little fictional vignette to convey the intent of the game.)
* Create another **google sheet** for character keeper for play testing.

Through the testing and design process, these source files go out of sync. 

Important admission: I&#39;m lazy and don&#39;t like updating things in multiple places.

Important discovery: Google docs let you *link files*. If I format a Google Sheet correctly, I can paste it into a Google Doc, linked to the source. (My rulebook for [The Pack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5NRqnCdp89i4rst9lSX2M45qTxYXBLtomCoH4yFe4c/edit?usp=sharing) is constructed this way.) So, if I update the Google Sheet of rules. and moves, these are reflected in the Google Doc.

In playtesting The Pack, I&#39;m capturing ideas for updates in the Character Keeper, so now that file is itself a source of design information.

My hope is to link the Character Keeper to the Source file, so that updates sync everywhere.

What have you done to manage your design working documents?</description>

<p>Back to the topic at hand, one reason that I’ve chosen my method is that if you separate your working documents from your editing medium, you get immediate gains.  I’ve used my git repo through several different online and offline editing tools and several different places for the repos themselves.</p>
<p>I tried using Evernote, Notion, Joplin, and several other editors that held all of the content, and the one thing that they had in common that eventually steered me away from them was the fact that I didn’t have the source in plain text under my control, so I was tied to their platform more or less.  With my repos I’ve gone from Atom to Sublime Text to HackMD to Obsidian to Visual Studio Code, and I’ve not had to change the location or format of my files for any of those changes.  It’s one of the reasons that I use WriteMonkey 2 and haven’t upgrade to 3 as of yet.</p>

<p>I try to do a lot of the organization and asset collecting in Evernote, and keep tabular data in Google Sheets—that’s really nice, because between the regular spreadsheet formulas and the scriptability with js, you can run some really nice simulations of your mechanics right in Sheets, skipping a few rounds of super broken playtesting. <img src="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I usually don’t import into InDesign or whatever until after everything’s pretty set, and even then, I use the space/shape constraints to help with a final editing pass.</p>

              <p>Honestly, my files are kind of a mess, but that’s almost deliberate. It forces me to go back through and re-organize things now and again, especially before showing stuff to people, and it helps reset my brain, so that I can see stuff from a new angle. I do a lot of drafts of my creative work.</p>
<p>Currently I have…</p>
<ol>
<li>a readable quickstart guide, that I can share and people can read</li>
<li>a ballooned, mismatched quickstart guide that I use for playtests when I’m there to explain</li>
<li>Google docs full of notes for extra moves and mechanics not yet implemented</li>
<li>A document where I’m practicing layout tricks</li>
<li>A list of resources, like stock art I might use</li>
<li>character sheets…</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s a lot of stuff… I don’t think I’d recommend my method to others, but this is what works for me. I’m getting ready to reconsolidate and make a new readable presentable draft.</p>
<p>BTW, The Pack looks really cool! I laughed out loud when I got to the Cat.</p>

Structured data can be presented through different lenses, so the collection of long form descriptions of characters, locations, etc. can be automatically summarized and filtered.

You can really go wild designing document systems using it, or stay simple and just maintain a wiki-like structure. Plus, everything is in the cloud and syncs nicely. I recommend checking it out!</p>
