    <description>***Slave Pits of the Undercity***

Thursday nights, 8:00 PM EST (UTC-5)
6-JAN-2022 through 31-MAR-2022

*It is time to put a stop to the marauders! For years the coastal towns have been burned and looted by the forces of evil. You and your fellow adventurers have been recruited to root out and destroy the source of these raids. But beware—hundreds of innocent people have been taken by the slavers and have never been seen or heard from again!*

This game is a quarterly run of the AD&amp;D module series A1-4, &quot;Against the Slavers&quot;, originally published in 1980. Attendance at all sessions is strongly recommended, but is not required. This game will have four players: I am reserving one seat for Jim Crocker, who gave me the idea to run this series. I&#39;ll also note that it&#39;s been a LONG time since I&#39;ve run a game using a D&amp;D retro-clone ruleset, so please bear with me!

* **Concept:** The PCs are adventurers looking to stop a band of slavers who have been raiding towns and capturing innocent people for profit.
* **Aim:** To get a taste of the early days of the hobby with a classic module series using a recreation of an early edition of D&amp;D.
* **Tone:** A gritty low-fantasy adventure with danger, peril, violence and a serious tone. If this were a movie, I&#39;m going for a moderate &quot;R&quot; rating.
* **Subject matter:** The unabated evil of a slavery ring, and the efforts of our heroes to bring it down.

**System:** This game will be using *Old School Essentials Classic Fantasy* along with the optional *Advanced Fantasy Genre Rules.*

**Prior Experience:** None required. All rules will be taught at the table, along with a brief explanation of OSR play style assumptions.

**Technology:** We will play using Zoom for videoconferencing, plus Roll 20 for character sheets and maps. While the GM would prefer players to be on video, it is absolutely not necessary to use a camera: An audio connection is all that&#39;s needed.

**Recording** : If players are amenable, I would like to record this session. With the enthusiastic consent of the players, I would like to make the sessions available for public viewing on my YouTube channel

**Safety Practices:** We will be using a layered approach to safety, including Open Door, Lines &amp; Veils, and the X-Card. We will review the safety practices at the start of the game. This game follows the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).
