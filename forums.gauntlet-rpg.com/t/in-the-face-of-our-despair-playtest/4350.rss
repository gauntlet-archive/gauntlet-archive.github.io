**NOTE: This is a playtest of a new game. This game is Rooted in Trophy, a very close hack to Trophy Dark. I will do my best to provide an awesome game session, but there may be some hiccups!**

This is a fangame I created for Brinkwood, but you do not need to be familiar with Brinkwood to enjoy this game.

This session is scheduled for 3 hours. The session will be recorded if everyone is cool with it! If not, no worries. We will be using Streamyard. I will email everyone about one week ahead of the game to confirm attendance.

***In The Face Of Our Despair*** *is a collaborative storytelling game about a group of fae guardians fighting a doomed war in a forest that falls to vampiric corruption. This game tells the story of the physical and magical corruption of the fae guardians as they lose more of their territory to the vampire lords.*

*This is not a hopeful story of magical beings successfully fighting off the invaders and saving their home. All they are doing is trying to buy enough time for survivors to leave behind the forest, to preserve what little magic they can. In hopes that one day, generations from now, others will rise against these vampire lords and destroy them.*

*This is a story of horror and desperation, of doomed protectors meeting tragic ends. It is very likely that all the fae guardians will die, be corrupted and enslaved by the vampirism, or—at best—be permanently scarred and haunted as they stay on the run and hide away in the darkness.*

Safety tools: We will be using script change, lines and veils, and an open door policy. We can change these tools to whatever suits the table best. This game follows [The Gauntlet&#39;s Inclusivity Policy](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/the-inclusivity-policy.html).

**Content Warning: tragedy, horror, body horror, doppelgangers, war, prisoners.**

If you sign up and your availability changes, please remember to drop from the site and give me a heads up.
