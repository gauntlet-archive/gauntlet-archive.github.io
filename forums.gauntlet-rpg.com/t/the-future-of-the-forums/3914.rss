              <p>In the interests of transparency, the current state is that Shane and Joao are out as admins, while Cass and Yoshi have recently decided to step away from moderation.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with everything Christo said but he won’t be banned for his reply.</p>
<p>I’m closing this thread for now because while we want there to be open discussion about what happened with Shane locking the forum and his reasons for why he did it, the mod team is currently understaffed to properly moderate such a discussion. We will be discussing internally amongst the mods how to best have this discussion at some point in the near future.</p>

              <p>Typically, the Gauntlet community will not clarify what happened publicly what happened.</p>
<p>It’s not just the admins. Many people, especially those of marginalized identities, left the Gauntlet when it became apparent that the Code of Conduct is not applied equally to everybody, and a bad actor was returning. As is common in an organization that fosters a personality cult rather than a community, the well-being of the celebrity was valued more than those who had been impacted.</p>
<p>The organization decided it was OK with this, will wait for the exodus to end, and then continue on as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>To be clear, I left the Gauntlet about a month ago, very dissatisfied with how events have unfolded. I’ve stayed on the forums because it was ostensibly not a formal part of the Gauntlet and there is a lot of great discussion here. I’m sad to see that <a class="mention" href="/u/shane">@shane</a> has left, because I know he put a lot into building the Gauntlet and these forums and really valued the people here, but I respect his decision.</p>
<p>After this post I may be banned from the forums because the Gauntlet had done that in the past. I do believe in openness and felt you, <a class="mention" href="/u/minx">@minx</a>, and others deserved an answer, and if I get banned I’ll just move on to something new and perhaps will see you around.</p>
<p>I’m sure this will all stabilize in a few days.</p>

<p>He’s no slouch technically, either.</p>
<p>And he may be the most moral white guy I know. And a cool-ass anarcho-communist aware of the horrors of capitalism better than most of us.</p>
<p>So, we’ve got a supremely moral, level headed guy with unmatched technical ability who left. And, apparently, Gauntlet leadership is surprised and not expecting it?</p>
<p>Perhaps we should talk about that?</p>

<p>edit: Also, if your avatar is now missing, please re-upload… we’ve had to migrate to a different storage solution as well and somehow it appears that some avatars didn’t make it over. I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>You are probably wondering: Hey, why can’t I login? Why do things look strange?  The Management of The Gauntlet has made some decisions recently that make it impossible for the Admins of the Forums to continue their (unpaid) work for them in all good...</p>
