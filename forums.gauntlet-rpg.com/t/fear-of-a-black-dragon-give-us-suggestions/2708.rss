    <description>@Coalhada and I are always on the hunt for new modules and setting books to cover on the award-winning Fear of a Black Dragon podcast. We&#39;d love to hear your recommendations for things to play and cover. We are looking for two things:

**OSR or old-school fantasy modules** 
This is our bread and butter. Classic modules, OSR modules, or things from the SWORD DREAM movement are all welcome suggestions. 

**Classic modules for non-fantasy RPGs**
We have covered The Arasaka Brainworm, a definitive module for Cyberpunk 2020, and The Secret of Castronegro, which, while not necessarily definitive, is certainly a classic for Call of Cthulhu. We would like similar suggestions. Tell us the module and the game it goes with

Thanks for your help!

It makes some interesting efforts at changing the dynamic of the Mega-dungeon in the direction of usability and brevity.  Plus sci-fi dungeons are hard to do right, and it manages quite well.</p>

              <p>Castle Amber and Palace of the Silver Princess for B/X D&amp;D.</p>
<p>Castle Amber is the peak of weird “funhouse dungeons” to me, based on the Averoigne series by Clark Ashton Smith and just a wild ride of a read.</p>
<p>Palace of the Silver Princess (at least the original orange cover written by Jean Wells) is an interesting dungeon, but also one with a fascinating history. It’s the only module from the Basic D&amp;D TSR era written by a woman (Wells), and it was quite suddenly pulled from shelves by TSR for reasons due to internal office politics (and a lot of chauvinism) to be replaced by a modified version. Worth a look.</p>

              <p>Silent Titans! Reading the adventure cover to cover like Patrick Stewart recommends helped me as the GM experience some of the twists and turns that my players are experiencing in play. I was so enraptured by Stewart’s ability to tell a story while still writing a setting/adventure book that I have found easy to use at the table in both physical and PDF format. I’d love to hear what you two have to say about it.</p>
