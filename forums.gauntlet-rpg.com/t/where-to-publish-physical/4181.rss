    <title>Where to Publish: Physical</title>
    <link>https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/where-to-publish-physical/4181</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had some success since publishing a PDF on DriveThruRPG, and now I&#39;m ready to release my next title as a physical zine as well. Where do people like to do this? The options I&#39;ve explored all require a monthly subscription of some sort; is this just a cost of doing business, or is there a popular portal through which I can accept payments and fulfill shipping myself?</description>

              <p>If you’re mostly looking for the online store front, you might want to look at <a href="http://itch.io" rel="nofollow noopener">itch.io</a>. Once you have the pdf, you can add an option, basically, for different version (regular, premium, whatever), but you can also use them to add the physical item.</p>

              <p>Oh, you’re right.  I was confused by a weird branding overlap: <a href="https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6629-set-up-your-weebly-powered-square-online-store">Square Online Stores</a> are free (and powered by Weebly) but have fewer customization options that a full Weebly site.  I’ve set one up but wanted an option better integrated into my existing site.</p>
<p>Paypal buttons are the lowest-maintenance solution for sure.</p>

              <p>I don’t think Weebly allows you to sell without upgrading to their basic tier (I just tried and I hit a subscription wall), but I will definitely look into the PayPal button. Thanks!</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.weebly.com">Weebly</a> has a free tier and processes transactions through Square.  Handy if you want to use square for in-person transactions.</p>
<p>If you are ok with a simple ‘Buy Now’ button, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/tt/webapps/mpp/buttons">Paypal Buttons</a> are easy to embed in a page you already have. <a href="https://www.narrativedynamicspress.com/">My site</a> uses Paypal buttons currently.</p>
<p><a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> has a free tier as well and I like their clean layout.  You can even embed items in other sites (Wordpress etc).  I’m looking at switching to Gumroad, for the better tracking of items and deeper user features.</p>
