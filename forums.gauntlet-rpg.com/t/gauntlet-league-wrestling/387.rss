                                       Gauntlet League Wrestling
                             Bright Lights, Big City Throw Downs!!

   I will be running 5 sessions of World Wide Wrestling in April on Mondays at 2:30 Eastern. These will be for 5 players and last 3 hours. It will be recorded for post with player approval.

   The lead up to the Gauntlet-paloosa PPV is in full swing. The greatest GLW superstars are on the hunt for the gold, and talent from across the nation and the world are ready to make an impact. Everyone is jockeying for their spot in the PPV...and eyeing a chance at the main event. Who will rise to the occasion?!?

  This will be a high level game with every character starting with 2 advances. The focus will be in creating strong feuds to culminate at the PPV. I want backstage politics and creating onstage chemistry. Old characters from the GLW universe are welcome, but will be rebuilt with the 2 starting advances. New players are always encouraged to give WWW a try. The Gauntlet Inclusivity policy will be in effect and the X-Card will be on the table.
