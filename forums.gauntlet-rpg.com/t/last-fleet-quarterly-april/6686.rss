This is a run of [Last Fleet](https://blackarmada.com/product/last-fleet/), a PbtA game of the last remnants of humanity fleeing from an implacable alien foe in a ragtag fleet, by [Josh Fox](https://twitter.com/armadajosh) of Black Armada games. Sessions will be three hours in length, and this is the second month of a quarterly series running the same time and day in May as well. Attendance in this month of play does not constitute a commitment to play in the final month of the quarterly, though first refusal for May will be given to people who have already played a session. This game will be played using the open table policy, and you are more than welcome to sign up even if you cannot make all sessions. General sign-ups will be available in 72 hours time (March 15th). We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for our sessions. This session will be recorded, and may be released on Youtube with the consent of all participants. 

*The last of humanity are fleeing across space, pursued by the implacable inhuman adversary that destroyed their civilisation. They’re outnumbered and outgunned. Supplies are running low. The actions of a brave few could be all that stands between humanity and extinction.*

*Welcome to the **Last Fleet***

Last Fleet takes inspiration from Battlestar Galactica, and for this run I would like to stick quite close in tone and aesthetic to the 2000&#39;s series. We will flesh out more of the universe, our fleet, and the foe that pursues us as part of the initial Session Zero, but I would like BSG to be our key touchstone.

Content Warnings:  This is a game that focuses on military action against a terrible foe, and as such violence and loss are key themes in the game, including death of civilians. A key mechanic of the game focuses around building stress/pressure and often releasing this in destructive ways, as well as a sense of despair. Betrayal and toxic relationships are lucky to be features of the game, as is infiltration by/loss of control to an alien threat. We will have a discussion on tone and content before the game begins, as well as establishing Lines &amp; Veils to provide a comfortable play experience. This game will take place under the [Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html) and the safety tools [Script Change ](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m)and [X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) will be in use. I will aim to get in touch with participants through either the Gauntlet Slack or email a week in advance of the game to confirm attendance and provide play materials.
