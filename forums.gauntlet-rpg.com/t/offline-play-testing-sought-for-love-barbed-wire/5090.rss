    <title>Offline play-testing sought for ‘Love &amp; Barbed Wire”</title>

    <description>I’ve got an ashcan edition of an epistolary RPG “Love &amp; Barbed Wire” ready. I’ve had some successful early feedback, and I’d love to have a few more people involved in playtesting the game - it is particularly well suited to our current Coronavirus lock-in days!

The game takes about 45 minutes to play if done in real time, or it can be played asynchronously and stretch out as long as you need it to. 

The two players represent one person on the front line in WW1 and their lover back home. You write letters back and forth across five chapters, with playing cards used to randomly generate emotional themes to overlay on the general theme of each chapter. 

In this way the players create a fictional relationship between two people that reflects upon the sad reality of hopes and fears experienced by many people in the conflict last century. 

No obligation, but the ashcan edition is free to download and I’d **love** to have feedback from anyone who plays it. What was clear, what wasn’t clear, how you felt about the game etc. 

With thanks if advance
Alex
