***Icebox:*** ***Timeline***  **is a GMless science fiction tabletop role-playing game about the passengers and crew on a lost starship as they drift in and out of cryosleep across years, decades, centuries, and millennia.**

In  *Icebox: Timeline* , you and three friends play out a series of scenes from URSA’s records of the events on the lost starship Sequoia. Each of you takes the role of one crew member or other inhabitant aboard the ship, and your scenes will span the twelve thousand year history of the ship. The scenes are created in a non-linear fashion, jumping forward and backward in time. Play might start with a scene near the end of the story, or begin in the middle and work your way outwards. You may recount your characters’ history in a completely random order. You won’t know when in time a scene will happen until it happens!

A single session of  *Icebox: Timeline*  runs approximately two or three hours, and requires exactly four players.

This is a one-shot &quot;playtest&quot; of a 95% finished game that&#39;s been brewing for a few years. (You can listen to folks talk about it on a [Gauntlet Podcast](https://gauntletpodcast.libsyn.com/episode-81-coriolis-icebox-timeline-star-wars-world) from way back, and the current-ish playtest document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dawVDSQQovyPKJ-ulVZbGzm-WBPg1qdv3e2OPdtfPkY/edit?usp=sharing).) Ideally, we&#39;ll play with four brand new players, with me facilitating, but I&#39;m happy to jump in and play if need be. The session will be recorded (if all participants agree), and shared on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Gs6F6p2DrduoeJJbDTOaaZQK44JvLuR).

**Duration:**  Up to three hours, but may run less depending on how we play.

**Breaks:**  At least two 5-10 minute breaks near the hour.

**Venue:**  Marc&#39;s Zoom

**Recording:**  Yes, used by me for development, shared publicly with all players&#39; consent.

**Safety** : Lines &amp; Veils, [Script Change](http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m), and Open Door Policy. This game will follow [The Gauntlet Community Code of Conduct](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/community-code-of-conduct.html).

I&#39;ll send out links for zoom and other information via email in the week before game time.

RSVPs open to all on 3/1/22 at 1pm CST
