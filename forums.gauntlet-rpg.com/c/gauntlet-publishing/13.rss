              <p>I’m finally running Trophy for the first time since getting all the physical Kickstarter stuff (I ran Trophy Dark out of Codex once back in the day), and I have some questions to ask more experienced folks.</p>
<p>Should I start with Trophy Dark or go straight to Gold? The plan is for this to be a one-shot with the potential to play more if everyone enjoys it.</p>
<p>Is there a particular incursion that is widely regarded to be the best for introducing the game? Or, if not, one that is a general favorite?</p>
<p>I’m excited! Thanks, y’all.</p>

              <p>I was listening to the Talking Hearts of Wulin recording, and looking at the handouts and was reminded of something I found a while ago but didn’t comment on.</p>
<p>This is Comfort and Support from the book:<br>
COMFORT &amp; SUPPORT<br>
When you assist a fellow PC, roll.<br>
ON A HIT, you lift them up: they may choose to give you a Bond with them or clear a marked Element.<br>
ON A 10+, you may also clear an Element yourself, ask them a question they must answer, or give them a Bond with you.<br>
In a scene, you may use this move to aid someone before or after a roll. Spend a Bond you just created with them to give them a +1 to their roll.</p>
<p>This is Comfort and support from both the Core Moves and Core Moves (Printer Friendly) handouts:<br>
When you assist a fellow PC, roll.<br>
On a hit you lift them up: they may choose to give you a Bond with them or clear a marked Element.<br>
<strong>On a 7-9</strong> you may also clear an Element yourself, ask them a question they must answer, give them a Bond with you, or gain +1 Influence (Courtly).<br>
In a scene, you may use this move to aid someone before or after a roll. Spend a Bond you just created with them to give them a +1 to their roll</p>
<p>Bolding mine.</p>
<p>It seems to me like this is probably just an error in the handouts, but since it’s been around for a while now (I downloaded the most recent copy of the Core Moves from DTRPG just to check) so I thought I’d try to bring it to someone’s attention.</p>

          <title>Codex - Gossamer Miscellany</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Dalafren]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Gauntlet Publishing</category>

            <p><a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/u/dalafren">@Dalafren</a> wrote:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>We are crowdsourcing the miscellany for Codex - Gossamer! The prompt for this miscellany is: “What is out there in the Gossamer Void?” For those unfamiliar, the Gossamer Void is a part of the setting in Trophy where few details have been established so far–now is our chance to paint the landscape! What we know about the Gossamer Void so far: it is only reachable by magic or ships that fly through the sky in some sort of astral plane or other realm not normally reachable from Ambaret or Fort Durin. In the Void are floating “islands” inhabited by strange individuals (there is even an entire archipelago out in the Void). For more inspiration, here are the two Trophy Gold incursions that have touched on the Gossamer Void so far: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f8tlsTyF1fdCKl81xNZzghlw39S-NBco/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f8tlsTyF1fdCKl81xNZzghlw39S-NBco/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>For each entry, when you consider “what is out there in the Gossamer Void,” try focusing on just one of the following ideas: 1) the name, look, crew, and purpose of a flying ship that travels the Gossamer Void; 2) a treasure, and where it is rumored to be hidden; 3) a trap, and how it interferes with treasure-hunters; or 4) a monster, richly detailed and a habit or two it has as it dwells in the Void.</p>
<p>Submissions should be no more than 1-3 short sentences. By submitting here in the replies, you’re agreeing to let us use it (you’ll get a credit on the issue). We’re looking for evocative things; the purpose of the miscellany is to inspire the reader. Please do not submit any entries with sexist imagery (we won’t publish it).</p>
<p>Note: if you’d like your name to be listed differently on the Codex credit, send me a DM here (but please keep your submissions in the thread).</p>
<p>For this miscellany, we’re looking for things that are fantastical, horrifying, otherworldly, and occasionally humorous or ironic. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>“Captain Faust sails a ship formed from superheated sand. Three-quarters of the Glass Cannon’s crew are always blind folded while the rest work in a hobbled state to restrict how fast they can move. These precautions are necessary when hunting a beast that drives someone mad with nothing more than a look from any one of its ten-thousand eyes.”</p>
<p>“They say a solidly black chunk of land floats in a perpetually black piece of sky. If anyone could navigate to this rock, they would find the thrice-locked black chest–inside, the black heart of the immortal king.”</p>
<p>“Some try to navigate the Void by complex star models – a kind of three-dimensional version of a star chart. The dangerous bit is when you mistake a school of glowing void-krill for a star and navigate into the bull-whale fishery. Few survive their first encounter with the tri-jawed giants.”</p>
<p>“On a particularly green and lush rock, a group of long-limbed and hairy humanoids seem to cry for help from in the tree-line. Only when treasure-hunters get too close can they see these “creatures” for what they are – the many hands of a much larger creature that seeks to devour the crew and use their clothes to make more finger puppets.”</p>

              <p>Whenever I run a game of Brindlewood Bay,  my Murder Mavens always begin by wanting to know the cause of death of the murder victim. Reasonable, but many of the published mysteries don’t provide clues related to the cause and the Presenting the Mystery section may only say “the Sheriff suspects foul play”.</p>
<p>How do you reveal, or choose to reasonably NOT reveal, cause of death in such Mysteries when you’re the Keeper?</p>

We have had a very successful campaign so far—over 4000% funded, 20 stretch goals unlocked, and a brand new Roll20 Companion reward added. It would help us out a lot if you would take a look at the campaign and consider pledging!</p>

              <p>Is there a way to back your Brindlewood Bay kickstarter outside of kickstarter? Because Kickstarter apparently needs a credit card (and credit card only) and I am from Europe - Germany specifically, and I do not own a credit card, do not need one in my day-to-day life and will not get one just for the kickstarter. I wanted to contact you via Email, but alas I could not find an email address anywhere on the homepage or at the kickstarter site.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>

              <p>Hi! I’ll be running Brindlewood Bay for a few weeks, and while I like the game and I’m pretty excited about it, my biggest hurdle right now are some of the references. Like, what does <code>Martha's Vineyard</code> means? Being from México I don’t have a lot of context for some of these, mainly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the Cardigans<br>
Goin’ Fishin’<br>
Hippy Dippy<br>
Martha’s Vineyard<br>
Speed Walkin’<br>
Up in Pumps</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can imagine them, but if you have a tv/film character to reference that would help me and my players a lot!</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with the Maven Moves, because I’m not familiar with most of those shows, but they are character names and they are more easily googleable, so I get the gist</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

I am preparing for my first BB session, really excited about it!</p>
<p>I have a quick question:<br>
In the fourth Crown of the Void it’s said that you gain the “Obsessed with the Void” condition but, unless my search-fu is failing me, it’s never said what it does.<br>
Is it just that it takes a condition slots so you are more likely to have to use a crown?</p>

              <p>Hello!<br>
I just bought Brindlewood Bay and plan to run a session soon.</p>
<p>Going through the rulebook, I have a few questions (and will likely have more in the near future). Sorry if the answer is obvious, I just couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>There they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cozy Vignettes: they are just for the atmosphere, right? Seems like they have no impact on the game at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cozy Move: The cozy move is triggered during investigations, when two or more Mavens request a downtime together, right? Is there a limit to how many times a Cozy move can trigger in a single session? Once per day? Giving out a clue seems pretty powerful, especially if you have like 4 Mavens and they do 2 couples of cozy moves at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the Meddling Move implicitly tied to a mystery? You could have characters/locations that are connected to more than one mystery. Will the Maven know to which mystery is the clue connected to?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>
